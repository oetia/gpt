Chapter 1: Reincarnate into the House of Quordentz
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Despite not having any memory of being hit by a truck, I was reincarnated to another world. The last memory I had was that I drank so much at our year-end party then I took the last train where I perhaps died. Honestly, I remember little around that part, since I was also dead drunk at that time.

The fact that I reincarnated in a world different from Earth, I learned about it several years after my birth. The world was like Middle Ages Europe like most Japanese people imagined. Putting it in more familiar terms, it was a world that would appear in role-playing games. After all, I had seen my father wearing a full armor while riding on a horse and my mother cured my cold with magic back when I was a baby. No matter how you look at it, this place was neither in Japan nor was it on Earth.

Speaking of reincarnation, it was common to meet with some deity and then receive an astonishing power. Unfortunately, I didn’t have such a good fortune. Fortunately, I reincarnated into a noble family. Moreover, I wasn’t some third or fourth son of a poor noble in the border, but the eldest son of a marquis who holds great power in the kingdom.

I am Wilk, the eldest son of the Marquis of Quordentz in the Kingdom of Levios. 

This was my identity in the new world.

Since I gained this identity, I would like to protect it no matter what. I had my knowledge of my previous world. Based on what I understood about nobles, siblings would kill each other to become the head of the family. If by some chance that there was another son born in my family, we would have to fight for succession. Preparing for that situation, I decided to take precautions.

Unlike on Earth, there exist incredible powers known as magic in this world. Moreover, the magic power that the nobles have was in a completely different league compared to the commoners. Magic was also the source of power used to govern the populace.

In other words, the nobles must have a strong magic power. Having learned of these matters about nobles on a certain day when I was five years old, I began training to improve my magic power, which was a very cliché turn of events. But thanks to that, my magic power had grown extremely great that my parents and even my grandfather gave me their approval. In a great mood, my parents became eager for my training, and I continued to meet their expectations. Everything was possible because I had knowledge of my previous world. Due to that, I gained the chance to put in place some ideas from Earth. The products that I made had yielded profits and became our specialty product.

Just like that, my life here was sailing very smoothly. I had significant trust from my parents, possessing a magic power that one could be proud of as a noble, engaging in economic activities in the territory. I would be without a doubt the next head of the family.

I was twelve years old. I only had one big problem―sexual desire.

I was around 1st year of junior high, based on the standards of my previous world. Naturally, my sexual desire was above the clouds. Fortunately or perhaps not, there were so many servants going around my surroundings. My environment was not one where I could masturbate so easily. The only place I could do it was in the bathroom. If it was in my room, even if I could take care of it slowly, it wouldn’t completely deal with the problem. Honestly, I was disinclined to do it in the bathroom.

For the time being, my sexual desire was at a suppressible level, but I wouldn’t be able to delay it any longer. When I was a junior high in my previous world, I used to jerk off every day. While I still have my reasoning, I must think of a way for me to be able masturbate without troubles.

「Wilk-sama. May I?」

「Hm? Oh, Tesh. What’s the matter?」

The voice of the old servant, Tesh, sounded while I was thinking of ways on how I could masturbate. His tone suggested that he had some important matter to tell.

「Master told to come to the innermost room after finishing dinner.」

「The innermost room?」

Yes, Tesh said with a nod. The innermost room was rarely used, and only specific people that were allowed by the head can enter. Of course, servants like Tesh were forbidden from entering without permission. The room was mostly used when discussing matters that would cause problem if it were to leak outside. Even I was only able to enter several times in this twelve years that I had been living here.

「Then I will immediately head over after dinner.」

Father definitely had something to tell. Whether it was something good or bad, I would like to get it done quickly.

My family usually ate dinner together, but because it was the season for socializing or something like that, it had become difficult to meet with my parents. I finished my meal quickly and headed over to the room where my father was waiting.

「Father. I’m entering.」

Inside the room, my father—Marquis Quordentz—was sitting on his desk, waiting. Seeing my father’s eyes that were more serious than usual, I decided to adjust my attitude.

「Sit down.」

I sat down on the chair nearby.

The conversation started with casual topics such as how I’ve been doing lately, and then turned to how my products, which I made with my knowledge of the previous world, caught the attention of the merchants and how it was being discussed even in other territories.

Just as I was thinking about the reason I was called here, my father stood up slowly.

「Wilk, you would have to consider about your marriage partner in few years.」

Marriage? In the previous world, forget about marriage, I didn’t even have a girlfriend, so I was a virgin. Well, of course, there was no way that the heir of a marquis could stay single.

「Marriage, is it?…」

「Hmm? You don’t look very interested.」

Thinking of the marriage between nobles, political marriage came to mind. That’s the impression I had, and I learned in my twelve years of living here that it was spot-on. At any rate, they would decide my marriage on their own, so it would just be my loss to have an interest in it.

「Hm. I’ve been letting you do as you please for your interest was beneficial to the territory. I see. You haven’t been much in contact with the young women from other territories in the first place.」

Without waiting for my reply, my father seemed to have grasped to something on his own. Indeed, I didn’t have many acquaintances among nobles. I could act like a perfect noble since I had been taught about etiquette since young, but I never thought of keeping a woman company in such a straining environment; even if the other person was only a little girl.

Above all, no matter how close we got to each other, there was no way I would be able to have a premarital sex like in my previous world. Rather, for nobles, it would be terrible if I were to make such a move. Why do I have to amuse a girl, even though there was nothing in it for me? That was my honest thought.

「Then father, is the matter about marriage？」

「That’s right. You’re already twelve years old. It’s about time that you learn about women.」

Learn about women. Now, what did he mean by that? Was my father telling me to attend the parties hosted by other nobles? Noticing that I was trying to understand the meaning of his words, he continued.

「It would be out of the question if you’re clueless on what to do during your first night with your wife. I don’t mind whether it is a woman outside the castle or a maid. Go and practice with a woman that you like.」

I began processing my father’s words. What was that? Was he telling me to threaten a girl using power and finally say goodbye to my virginity?

I felt my lower half getting hotter.

「Does that mean that I can call a woman to my bedroom?」

Hoh, father smiled as he looked at me meaningfully. I felt like he was telling me how I knew about such things.

「Exactly. However, always make sure to discuss it with Tesh no matter who you choose. You’ll need to avoid those with a background.」

From my father’s previous examples, such as choosing from the commoners and maids, and from what he just said, I judged that touching a noblewoman was out of the question.

「I’ll properly consult with Tesh so as to not cause you trouble, Father.」

「Very well. I’ve already given your allowance to Tesh. You can ask him the details. You can go.」

I nodded and stood up to leave the room.

「I’ll take my leave.」

「Last, let me give you an advice…」

Appearing hesitant to speak, my father continued.

「It would be better to pick an experienced woman for your first time. And, doing it forcefully might be good too, but doing it with the consent of the other party is much better.」

The face of my father turned to that of a horny old geezer. His usual seriousness nowhere to be found.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 2: Consultation Regarding My First Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I immediately summoned Tesh when I returned to my room.

「Father told me to learn about women.」

「Considering Young Master’s age, I think it’s about time.」

If it was in my previous world, I would be around junior high. Oh well, there was no use to keep holding the common sense in my previous world. Besides, I felt like my way of thinking had been getting closer to the nobles in this world after living here for twelve years.

I turned to Tesh, who had been looking at me standing, and showed a smile.

「Father told me to consult with you about women. According to my father’s words, there aren’t any restrictions aside from noblewomen….. Do you have any good idea?」

As if waiting for those words, Tesh took out a wooden plaque out of nowhere. Placed on top of the table, the amount of the budget was on it.

「There will be no problem choosing from Young Master’s personal servants and the common servants. In the case Young Master want Master and Old Master’s servant, please consult it with me. The same goes for the servants of Madam and Young miss.」

As expected of a marquis, there were a large number of servants employed in the castle. There were two kinds of servants: A servant who mainly served a member of the house and a servant who handles the matters inside the castle. Tesh, for example, was a servant who served me for the most part.

The number of my personal servants surpassed fifty, and the majority were men and the rest women. Furthermore, there were many young women among them. In short, those kinds of things were likely included in their duties.

「I wouldn’t think of touching the servants of my father and grandfather. Much less my mother’s servants.」

My mother’s personal maids were all beauties, but I couldn’t tell my mother to lend one to help me lose my virginity.

「In the case Young Master chooses a commoner outside the castle, we would have to pay money. Master has given the funds. Please take a look.」

Tesh said as he pointed towards the number in the wooden tag.

I’d also gone to the town quite a number of times, so I know the lifestyle of the commoners. That was why I noticed that the amount was a large sum. It was enough to buy several slaves.

「How much money does it usually take for a young girl?」

「It depends on the family of the girl… but for a virgin young girl of a common household, around five gold kiris. A silver is enough for a second time. In case the girl got pregnant, an extra ten gold kiris would be paid.」

Kiris gold coin was the currency in the Levios Kingdom, and its value was considerably high. An ordinary family living in the castle town would be able to live for half a year with two gold kiris as long as they were careful in their spending, I think. I’d been raised in a marquis’ house, so my conjecture might be wrong.

「Quite an amount, I seep.」

「Yes. The purpose is to have them feel obliged by paying a compensation.」

What would happen if I give them a gold coin?

『Poor girl, to be forced by a noble… Eh？you received five kiris gold coins?! Wait, you’re receiving so much?! Rather, aren’t you quite lucky?』

Apparently, that was how people around would think. The woman in question would begin to feel guilty as she used the money she received to pay for her everyday expenses. Like this, the hate they have towards me would decrease, and there would be an increase in women who would prefer to sleep with me. What a splendid way of handling it.

「But in that case, I would quickly run out of money.」

「If Young master is considering the expenses, it might be good to just buy a slave from the start. There wouldn’t be a need to pay every time.」

「Slave…」

The Levios Kingdom had a slave system. During times when invading other countries and lands of isolated tribes, it was allowed to take the natives as a captive and turn them into slaves. This kingdom invaded others quite often, so there was a lot of slaves. Father said that our territory had also been earning a large amount of money due to the wars these past several years. 

「Slavery appears to be flourishing outside the castle. Considering that the buyer is the eldest son of the House of Quordentz, it might be possible to get a decent slave.」

「Slaves, huh. It might not be a bad idea.」

Honestly, including my age in the previous world, I was a forty-something-year-old virgin, so I felt quite nervous doing it with an ordinary woman. Just imagining that I failed to lose my virginity to a maid in the castle made me restless. If it was a slave, it would be easy to silence her to protect my dignity.

However, there was one problem.

「I hear that the slave traders outside, um, do not handle slaves that specialize in such things.」

There were several slave merchants outside the castle, but there wasn’t any that specialize in sex slaves.

Slave traders from other cities who specialized in sex slaves had been buying beautiful women. 

「……I’m surprised that Young master knows.」

「I heard it from Viscount Galliana, and I just remembered about it.」

How could I possibly forget about it? 

「Viscount Galliana?」

There were many nasty rumors about Viscount Galliana. Furthermore,  his appearance was quite poor. A face filled with pimples and a body so fat that it wouldn’t be possible to see the area between the neck and his chin. He was the very picture of a corrupt noble. Originally a commoner merchant, he fixed his eyes on a viscount who was in need of money and using his abundant money, succeeded in taking over. He was a capable upstart noble.

「He’s an interesting fellow. His territory is stable, and I think he is not the kind of person they describe him to be. Besides, his son Deanrish is an honest man.」

I had many dealings with Viscount Galliana. He approached me back when I started putting my products in the market.

His appearance was that of a complete villain, so I was on guard at first, but when we conversed, I found that he was a rational and easy going person. As expected of someone who climbed from a commoner to a noble, I was able to tell that he had considerable ability.

The products that I made were continuously being distributed to Viscount Galliana. I took advantage of his ability as a merchant. As a result, my products became popular in the capital thanks to his marketing ability and our territory gained a large amount of wealth. 

Evidently, the Viscount also gained profit in the process. I was thinking that it was win-win for both sides, but it seems that Viscount Galliana didn’t think so. He said that he wanted to thank me because my products earned him lots of profit, but he wasn’t able to give back anything in return.

I explained the matter to Tesh.

「So, to save him some face, I think it’s a good idea to have him introduce us to a slave trader.」

In Viscount Galliana’s territory, there was a slave trading group specializing in sex slaves, and it was quite famous for its quality even in the capital.

Supposedly, it was impossible to have a transaction with this slave trader without an introduction from Viscount Galliana, so I would definitely have him introduce the trader to me. This would be the perfect chance for him to express his gratitude.

「I see. That might indeed be a good idea. But, it would develop a connection with a noble from another territory. I believe it’s better to consult with Master.」

「I understand. I’ll consult it with Father.」

I’d placed the schedule after dinner in my mind.

After that, I consulted with my father about having Viscount Galliana introduce a sex slave merchants.

In the end, there was no problem with the introduction part, but he warned me to make sure to decline if ever he gave a special offer such as discounts, and to pay it at regular price. It was probably to avoid making unnecessary favor.

When I returned to my room, I wrote a letter to Viscount Galliana while suppressing my excitement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 3: The Slave Trader Arrives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The slave trader arrived ten days after the letter was sent. Even though Viscount Galliana was close to Marquis Quordentz’s territory, it was still quite fast.

As the next head of the house, I obviously wouldn’t leave and go all the way to a slave trading group located in another noble’s territory. Calling out merchants was normal. 

Today, I was waiting for the slave trader at my residence and not the castle. This city—Nyuneri—was the main base of the House of Quordentz. It was a fortress city surrounded by threefold of walls. Supposing that it was possible to view from above, one would see three crooked ellipse layers, like the growth ring of a tree.[1]

The outermost wall separated the city’s interior to the outside environment, protecting against the invasion of magical beasts and large wild animals. Its appearance was like an inferior version of the Great Wall of China.

One of the inner walls separated the castle town and the agricultural area, and its purpose was to defend against the invasion of enemies, such as the savage tribes and army from other territories. A darkish unique stone stood up high, giving off an extreme feeling of pressure. 

The last wall separated the castle town and the residential area of the Quordentz family. The castle that was also my home, known as Nyuneri Castle, was located at the heart.

Setting aside the slave traders, there was no way the slaves could enter inside the castle, so they came to my residence.

「It is our Gandoran Group’s pleasure and honor to be summoned on this occasion. I’m the owner called Doran.」

I gave a dignified reply to Doran, who politely lowered his head. As the eldest son of a marquis, I couldn’t let myself get underestimated by a common merchant. After the greetings, we exchanged a few light conversations.

「I’m surprised that you’ve already prepared the goods in just a few short days.」

「Viscount Galliana especially advice to be extra careful. The slaves are of the highest quality we could provide.」

Tesh gave Doran, who was lowering his head like he was going to prostrate himself, the permission to let the slaves in. With a man appearing to be an employee standing at the front, the slaves entered in a line one after another. The man turned towards me and quietly lowered his head down. At the same time, another man at the back of the line was arranging the slaves in a row.

「Hoh.」

There were twelve women in a line, and each one of them was wearing a clean white robe. Their ages ranged from ten to around twenty years old. They had a common characteristic— beautiful. Several of them had chests so large that it was obvious from above their robes. The high standard level of their slave trading company was evident.

「If you would give the permission, we would like to introduce each one of them.」

Doran seemed like he was feeling at ease after seeing my reaction.  No doubt about it, he was thinking that he got me hooked. Though in reality, he really did.

I granted the slaves permission to introduce themselves.

「Then start from the left.」

Doran moved his gaze towards one of his employees, and the man sent a slave to the front with a push on the back. From the slaves arranged in a row, one of them went forward.

「This girl will be turning fourteen this year. She came from a farm village located in the Katina region.」

The girl lowered her head and gave a smile. Her sweet smile appeared very natural. If they trained her to do this, then their training was quite something.

「She’s in a completely good shape. Her speech has a hint of Katina region accent. She’s a virgin without any sickness.」

Then, Tesh asked.

「Have they been examined? Can that be trusted?」

「Yes. Please take a look at the examination results.」

Doran handed over a bundle of documents to Tesh. They sure came prepared.

Tesh called over an appraiser, verified its validity, and then handed it back to Doran. It seemed like there was no problem.

「Say something.」

I called out to the girl who came from the Katina region. I wouldn’t want something like a cute girl with a manly voice.

「Yes. Please buy me, Master.」

As though the line had been decided beforehand, she replied without any hesitation. Her voice was quite cute, too. I was glad.

「Her mother had a very beautiful figure. She’s likely to have a promising future.」

Upon hearing Doran’s words, the girl leaned forward and her robe shifted slightly. From the gaps of her robe, her growing chest befitting her age was slightly visible. Unconsciously, my eyes glued to her chest. 

「Is, is that so?」

Even I was aware of my unsteady voice. My virgin self was completely revealed. In reality, I was indeed a virgin, so there was no room for excuses. Well, my current appearance was that of twelve years old boy. Getting flustered upon seeing the chest of a young girl, view my innocence as a good thing.

Afterward, the remaining slaves continued their introduction. As expected, they were all high-quality goods. They all had well-defined features and excellent body development. It seemed like their training was also thorough, they properly introduced themselves and they didn’t have much of the distressful air usually found in slaves.

However, only the last girl was different.

「Concerning this slave, I’m very sorry. She has yet to receive a proper training since she just arrived a few days ago.」

Doran lowered his head with a regretful tone. The slave sitting at the rightmost corner of the line was wearing a hooded robe and was looking down, so her face was not visible.

『She still hasn’t been trained, so you might feel displeased. But, I brought her since it would be regretful to miss seeing a very pretty girl. If you could tolerate the slight displeasure, I could take off her hood and show her. Would you like to? 』

Doran proposed something with that kind of suggestive meaning.

「I do not mind. I wouldn’t be able to help but feel curious if we end without being able to see everyone.」

While waving my hands, I indicated them to take off her hood.

「Understood.」

Doran moved to the back of the girl at the right corner and told her to remove her hood in a low voice. However, the slave only shook her body and refused to obey. A slave who couldn’t take a hint. It looked like she really was a new arrival.

When Doran forcefully pulled the hood off, an ear jumped out of the hood. She had dark golden hair like honey and emerald-like green sparkling eyes. Her long ears extended to the sides, and her skin pale white.

It was a girl from the elf race.

「An elf?」

「Indeed. She’s a slave from this year’s northern expedition.」

The army of the kingdom would occasionally set off to an expedition to subjugate the northern part of the kingdom, which was the domain of the non-human races. Apparently, they found an elf village by chance during this year’s expedition and attacked it. Gandoran Group was the one who took in the captives as slaves.

「It’s my first time seeing an elf. Elves are just as beautiful as the rumors say. 」

No, they were better than the rumors painted them. Even though she was not wearing a smile like the other slaves, her despondent well-featured face was breathtakingly beautiful, slowly making people feel pity towards her. Speaking of elves, I had the impression that they were all flat-chested, but the chest of the girl in front was so large that it was bulging.

「By the way, how old is she? Some elves have younger appearance despite being older than my grandparents, right?」 

Well, if her appearance was young and beautiful, it didn’t really matter whether she was a hundred or a thousand years old. Her height was around that of an elementary school student, so she shouldn’t be that old.

「She’ll be twelve years old this year. Same as the other slaves, she’s a completely healthy virgin girl.」

Surprisingly, our age was the same. Her chest was impressively large for her young age. I wonder just how much bigger would they still grow.

I felt like even my mind was going to be carried away along with my aroused lower half.

「I see. So her age matches her appearance? Hey, say something.」

Just like I did to the other slaves, I decided to check out her voice. However, the girl was too shaken to reply.

Doran’s expression changed and he moved to hurry the girl, but I stopped him with my hand. After a short silence, the girl finally uttered a word with teary-eyes.

「……Noo! Please don’t buy me……!」

It seemed like I was the only one who felt touched upon hearing her clear and beautiful voice. Tesh, Doran, and the employees behind them were stiffened upon hearing her response. Speaking in such a manner towards the young master of a marquis was offensive.

For the time being, I told Doran that we’d talk regarding the purchase, and ordered the slaves to leave the room.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 4: The Night after Buying a Slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The elven girl’s name was Eve. 

Long story short, I bought her.

There were only two small problems: price and transfer period.

Since slave traders couldn’t regularly get their hands on an elf slave, they always cost quite a lot. Doran placed a sky-high price tag on the elf, enough to blow two-thirds of the budget given by my father.

However, the price wasn’t a big deal. After all, I’d been earning money using the knowledge from my previous life. I wasn’t completely reliant on the money given by my parents; I also had my own pocket money that I could use when needed.

The next problem was the transfer period.

Doran apparently had his pride as a slave trader, and he was very reluctant to sell a slave who hadn’t been properly trained. 

「We’ll train her in half a year, so please wait until then. 」

Doran said.

His professionalism was worthy of praise, but I still decided to take the slave now. 

Why? The reason was simple. 

I’d been holding it in for eight days straight now so I could have sex immediately after buying a slave. Ever since I heard about the slave trader’s visit, I’d banned myself from masturbating. I wasn’t expecting him to tell me to wait for half a year. Just looking at the swaying breasts and skin of the lined up girls almost made me explode.

Perhaps sensing my desire—I mean my sincerest intentions, Doran finally gave in and accepted. I was really thankful.

There seemed to be some procedures in transferring the ownership of the slave, but I left all those work to Doran. Like that, Doran went on his way back, leaving only the elf girl here. 

「Young master. Should I report to Master that you won’t return to the castle and will stay here for the night?」

As I looked outside, it was already getting dark in the town. It felt somewhat troublesome to return to the castle now. There wasn’t any problem with the security here, so I’d prefer to spend the night here today.

Above all, it would be more convenient to stay here than in the castle since I was going to deliciously eat Eve today. It would be unbearable if my parents and  younger sister were to inquire me about it.

「Alright. Prepare my bath at once.」

Fortunately, this world had a bathing culture. I was very grateful since I was a Japanese in my previous life. As expected, those who had a bath in their house were mostly the nobles. The commoners apparently took their bath in a public bathhouse. Although they couldn’t enter the bath every day, the majority of them would take a bath twice or thrice a week. Among the nobles, only few were like me who took a bath every day. Incidentally, a week in this world was equivalent to seven days, same as back in my previous world.

Speaking of which, most of the noblemen wouldn’t go into the bath alone. There would usually be servants who would serve them in the bath. In my case, a more than fifty-year-old granny was in charge. I wouldn’t feel any stimulation even if her clothes were to get wet and become see-through, so I was saved, in a different sense. She washed my back as usual and also every nook and cranny of my body.

「About the slave I bought today, make sure to clean her properly. You can let her use the best soap.」

「Understood.」

I told the old granny to properly wash Eve. Perhaps knowing that I bought a sex slave, her expression turned to that of having understood something.

One of the products that I made using my knowledge from my previous life was a hard soap. The soap we were originally using was not good, so I made one myself, and now it had become one of the main products of our Quordentz family. Many varieties of soap were being produced, from cheap soaps for commoners to the high-class ones for the nobles. The soap inscribed with the emblem of Nyuneri City was widely known as a high-class soap even in the capital.

I got off the bath, and then lied down on the bed. I could hear the sound of my heartbeat. The reason my face was flushing probably wasn’t only because I’d just finished taking a bath. I stretched my body to calm the nervousness which had made me feel slightly uncomfortable.

「Haaa—」

Right after I left the bath, several of my personal maids were rushing towards the bath. They would probably surround Eve and scrub her clean. For the maids, she would be their young master’s first woman, so not a single speck of dirt must remain on her body. The fact that I liked cleanliness was well-known among the servants.

Considering that point, there was no doubt that Eve would stay in the bath for a considerable period of time. In order to calm myself down, I closed my eyes for a little bit on the bed.

…..….…

I could hear a distant knocking sound.

「Hnm…?」

I seemed to have fallen asleep for a while. Noticing that I’d slept, I immediately awakened my mind.

「Enter.」

From the way the door was knocked, I guessed it was probably Tesh. When the door opened, Tesh was indeed the one standing in there.

「Young Master. The preparations are all done.」

「I see.」

My heart began to pound. 

That’s right, I intended to take Eve today.

「We’ve applied the slave crest and magic seal without any problems. Please rest assured.」

「Well done, but she doesn’t really have enough magic power to do anything to me.」

Elves were a race boasting a large amount of magic power. Even a weak looking young girl would have a magic power strong enough to easily kill a fully armed soldier. If Eve had a more powerful magic power, she would be able to easily ignore the difference in our gender and physique and kill me in an instant.

Well, I had an exceptionally high amount of magic power, so I wouldn’t really lose. It wouldn’t do good to underestimate a reincarnator who had started training his magic power since a baby.

「If Young master would permit it, I’d like to have a maid keep watch…」

「Don’t give me that. I wouldn’t be like those idiot nobles who inserted it in the wrong hole.」

Apparently, during a nobleman’s first time, they would often be accompanied by a servant to watch over the scene. There was a story about a young nobleman who grew up thinking that putting it in the ass was the normal way to have sexual intercourse, which resulted in a great tragedy on his wedding night. It wasn’t known whether the story was just a rumor, but it became well-known among the nobility.

Even though Eve was a sex slave, she didn’t look like she knew anything about sex. Tesh being anxious couldn’t be helped. But I really didn’t want a servant to watch the moment I lose my virginity.

「But….」

「There’s no need for you to verify it right now. I also have someone I like among my maids. Just ask them by that time.」

The personal maids were employed by the Quordentz family, so the information would most likely get disclosed. If I had sex with any of them, they’d immediately find out whether I know how to have sex.

「Understood.」

Tesh smiled joyfully. It seemed like he was happy hearing that I liked someone among my personal maids. Perhaps he thought that I didn’t place them in my eyes since I suddenly bought a slave after being told to learn about women.

「Then, I’ll go and call Eve.」

「Alright.」

After giving a very spirited bow, Tesh left the room.

Then after few minutes, the door opened without any knocking.

Standing there was a beautiful girl looking like a fairy in her white dress.

The only thing I felt was the dryness of my throat.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 5: Deliciously Eating the Elf Slave (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The door closed just as Eve walked inside the room.

A servant arranged in a nearby room probably closed it, but the door was closed harder than expected, and a dry noise resounded inside the room, causing the silence to stand out. 

「What’s the matter? Come closer.」

Eve was standing near the closed door. The girl who looked only like an elementary school student replied.

「Umm, I…」

She only stood still as she held her hands in front of her chest. She appeared like she was going to cry from her shaking voice.

「How long are you going to stand there?  I told you come closer.」

In order to let her know who was the boss, I released my magic power towards her. A pure magic power before being changed to magic was nothing more than an energy, it wouldn’t injure a person. Still, the density of the magic power would display the extent of one’s magic power. 

「Eeeek!」

As if she’d received a blast, Eve curved her body around. She’d probably become scared of the intensity of my magic power.

「Who told you to curl yourself up？I won’t repeat myself again, come here!」

After releasing one more blast, Eve finally walked closer with unsteady steps. Her weeping noise sounded, and tears were continuously flowing out of her large green eyes.

「Don’t move!」

I got off the bed and stood in front of Eve.

「I did not tell you to move back.」

I grabbed Eve’s hand to prevent her from escaping and lightly pulled her closer. A yelp resounded in the room.

「You’re my slave. You know what we’re about to do, right？」

She didn’t give any response. 

Whether she didn’t want to acknowledge that she was a slave, or she didn’t really know, I couldn’t read it from her expression. 

Under the moon, her green watery eyes and pale white skin was inexplicably very beautiful. Noticing that I was still grabbing her wrist, I could see her slender fingers trembling.

Before I knew it, I was already embracing Eve.

「N, nooo!」

The slight voice that she was letting out was silenced by the intimidation of the intense release of my magic power.

Her height was almost no different from mine. I could smell the tender fragrance of a flower from her honey-blonde hair which extended up to her waist. The soft feeling of her well-developed breasts being squeezed to my chest made my nether regions so excited that it was about to burst out. I moved my arms around her slender and delicate back which looked like they would easily break, and embraced her with all my power.

「It hurts……!」

My mind immediately calmed down after hearing Eve’s pained voice, and then I relaxed the power that I was exerting in my hand. As though feeling relieved that the pain disappeared, she breathed a sigh of relief. Her lips which was releasing sweet breaths—slightly pink in color—looked very seductive.

In that case, let me have a taste.

 Like a pretentious guy appearing in a manga, I lifted her chin with my fingers.

 I tightly held her waist with one hand to not let her escape. As Eve still looked like she had no idea of what was about to happen, I slowly moved closer to her face. 

 「…! No!」

As expected, she turned her body to avoid me.

「Mmmngu! Nnmnnmn!」

I firmly held the back of her head and hugged her body to prevent her from escaping, and then fiercely sucked her tightly sealed lips. I could feel the softness of her lips, causing me to feel more excited.

「mnmuhh! mhhnnm!」

I released her lips with an intentional kiss sound. I held Eve and turned her body, and then pushed her towards the bed.

「Stop…! Please stop it! No! Nooo!」

I placed my hands on Eve’s shoulders while she was lying down on the bed, and increased the weight to prevent her from getting up. Only her feet were struggling, but in the end, she was just a girl so it wasn’t much.

「Why don’t you stop the useless struggling?」

Saying such a villainous line made me feel more stimulated. What happened to my original objective? I felt like the only thing I would learn would be how to rape a woman.

「Nooo! Nooo!」

While she was struggling, even her feet were now placed on the bed. I quickly mounted on Eve, who was facing up, and sat my butt on her abdomen. Our position looked like I was the one in the cowgirl position. 

Her babydoll dress was widely exposed due to her nonstop struggle, almost exposing her abundant breasts. Eve’s figure with her hair disordered on the bed looked very erotic.

「No!」

She set her lips in a hard line, showing a desperately resisting expression. I’d been restraining at first, but I felt that it was starting to get annoying.

「I need to teach a disobedient slave.」

I gave up riding on her and let her go. Eve looked like she was feeling relieved, but there was no way she was escaping.

I charged my magic power and activated Eve’s slave crest.       

「Aaaahrrg?! Aaaahhh!!」　

The moment it activated, Eve held her chest tightly, and then squeezed out a very pained voice. Her face turned pale and was breathing heavily—no, she looked like she couldn’t breathe anymore.

「It looks like I charged too much magic power.」

Even after I stopped inserting my magic power to the slave crest, Eve didn’t recover immediately. It took several minutes for her to calm her breathing down.

The slaves crest was a seal that brings enormous pain without inflicting any injury. A seal carved by magic couldn’t be confirmed visually, but it would react to the magic power of the master and activate. It was costly to carve the seal and requires a method of inflicting the pain, and then the activation via magic power. Due to its requirements, it wasn’t widely used.

The reason that the slave crest was applied to her was because I didn’t want to injure her beautiful white skin when punishing her.

「How is it? Do you understand your position now?」

「Eeeek!」      

「If you still don’t understand, then I’ll have you taste that kind of pain one more time.」

I pointed my index finger up and tried to release magic power. Seemingly understanding my threat, Eve shook her head to the side.

「I can always make you feel that pain. Make sure not to forget about that.」

Eve nodded her head immediately. I embraced her closer, and then kissed her lips. Her shoulders and back were slightly trembling, but she no longer resisted.

Chapter 6: Deliciously Eating the Elf Slave (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I moved Eve to the middle of the bed and instructed her to lie down facing up. This time, she obeyed in silence without needing for me to release magic power to scare her. The slave crests’ power sure was marvelous.

「Please let me go, please, please let me go, please let me…go……」

Her swelled eyes were staring at me begging, but I ignored it and was about to undress her. Her babydoll dress was firm with a non-transparent fabric. Her dress was so excellent that I thought about rewarding the servant who chose it later.

Ignoring her soft screams, I laid my hands on the fastened ribbon in front of her dress.

「Aaahh, please let me go! Please let me go!」

Eve’s voice was increasingly becoming louder, and along with it, my nether region was also becoming harder. I threw the untied ribbon to the side of the bed. Losing the cloth covering her chest area, Eve’s two peaks which were disproportional to her age were revealed. On top of her bulging pale white breasts, her slightly pink nipples could be seen. Her breasts which stayed in place without drooping too much to the side had caused me to unconsciously imagine an unripe sweetness.

「aaaaahh…」

Following my desires, I buried my face on her breasts. From the well-rounded softness spreading to my face, her body was warmer than I expected from her white skin. I couldn’t think of anything to the extent that I’d even imagined that the blood in my head had all gone to my erect nether region. I wanted to make this warm and soft thing mine. I licked her warmth with my tongue, and then tasted it inside my mouth.

「Noooo!! let me go! Please let me go!」

Her nipples shook along with her scream as though it was telling me to suck them. I grabbed her breasts which was covered with my saliva with the palm of my hand, and immersed myself in sucking her nipples. I sucked her right nipple, and then her left, before fiercely sucking her right nipple again. There wouldn’t be any milk to come out, but I couldn’t stop my action.

Her screams every time I sucked her nipples hard and the feeling from my lips gave me the finest flavor.

A breast was tasty even without milk.

「Mother, help mee! It hurts!!」

As I was stimulated, I continued sucking her nipples without caring even if they were to come off. I could no longer be bothered by Eve who was noisily screaming that it was painful. I lightly bit her nipples, sucked it, and then pulled it along with my face. Eve’s piercing screams every time I did so was also pleasurable. I was glad that her voice was very pleasing.

I didn’t know how long I’d been sucking her breasts. Her screams gradually softened, and by the time I had slightly regained my calmness, I shook off the reluctant feeling and separated from her breasts.

「Eve, your breasts tasted good.」

She did not respond. 

When I looked at her breasts, the area around her nipples was swelling red. Maybe I’d sucked it too much…

Perhaps because she’d been turning her body to the side, the upper part of her dress was coming off. I was still wearing my sleeping wear, so I took off my clothes to match her and became completely naked. Although late, it was slightly embarrassing to reveal my completely action-ready penis in front of a young girl. 

I moved my body closer to lie on top of her body. Our abdomen matched, chests pressed, and forehead touching each other. The feeling of our skins directly coming in contact with each other surprisingly felt very nice. Above all, the feeling of Eve’s breasts squeezing into my chest was the best.

「aaah,  again…..no…」

I lightly overlapped my lips with hers, and separated with a smooch. I pecked her lips to taste it again and again. 

「You’re lips feels so soft and good.」 

She was putting strength in her lips, but I could still feel its softness. It was one that I’d never imagined from the forceful kiss earlier. This time, I’d like taste it slowly.

「How long are you planning to close your mouth? Do you want to feel pain again?」

At a very close distance, I looked at Eve’s teary eyes. Staying at a distance so close I could hear her breathing, I continued.

「Let me tell you, I was still being gentle to you up until now. Do you understand what I’m trying to say?」

Eve’s expression was one that didn’t believe it all. But perhaps because she was afraid to speak, she stayed silent.

「It looks like you don’t understand… Have you forgotten about your mother？If you continue acting unreasonable, I can let you experience the same thing as your mother. Try to remember it.」

I controlled my magic power and then activated a magic. That magic would make the target remember a portion of their memory. It could cause a person to clearly remember the memories they wanted to forget and even those memories that they unconsciously forgot. Eve’s memory was refreshed upon hearing the word  「Mother」 and made her remember all her memory about it. 

「Ah…..Ahh…..Ah……aah……,m, oth,er……Mother……!」

Tears once again trickled down from her eyes. 

「My, mother……! stop! Motherr! Don’t hurt my mother!!!」

I immediately activated a magic with a calming effect at Eve who had suddenly struggled violently. She was probably able to calmly remember her mother’s miserable appearance now.

「Aaah……Aaaahhh……」

Naturally, Eve’s mother wasn’t the type of slave who could be sold as a virgin. According to Doran, since her mother was not a virgin, she was terribly raped by the slave hunters and by the time she’d reached the slave market, she was almost insane. Furthermore, those acts were done to her in front of the other elves. Eve had repeatedly seen her mother’s figure be raped by men.

「I don’t mind throwing you out. And then you’ll probably meet the same fate as your mother. Humph, mother and daughter meeting the same fate might not be too bad.」

Of course, there was no way that I would really abandon Eve after buying her for such a large amount. Well, she wouldn’t have a way of knowing that.

Perhaps she had imagined her own figure in her mother’s place, her already white hands turned even paler from her tight grip as she looked at me.

「No……! Noo! I don’t want! No!!! Don’t throw me! I don’t want to become like mother!!」

「In that case, what should you do, you know right? What’s the right thing to do whenever I ordered you…」

 I looked at Eve while intentionally displaying a smile. She closed her eyes once, and then said as she opened them:

「I, I won’t…..disobey master. Please, please, please don’t throw me……」

「Good. Then prove it here.」

Slowly, I once again went closer to her face to test her determination. Her shoulders shook for an instant, but probably because she was holding herself, she did not make any other movements.

「nnn……」

I lighty pecked her lips, and then I released it before tasting it again. That kiss was to savor her lips’ softness.

At the same time as I kissed her for the third time, I placed my hands around her head and signaled to take things to the next level. I moved my tongue to lick her closed lips and felt that she was no longer exerting strength in it. When I tried pushing my tongue deeper in her lips, I was surprisingly able to come in without difficulty.

「Aaa……nmuu」

I moved my tongue to entwine with hers, but I was able to tell that she was swiftly avoiding me. When I exerted strength into my hand around her head and moved her closer, as if sensing my demand, her tongue had stopped avoiding anymore. 

After fully savoring her tongue, I once again separated from her mouth.

「Good girl. I’m kind and gentle to good girls.」

 I said while caressing her cheek.

It was important to praise her for noticing my intentions. 

I once again kissed her, not forcefully, but gently and slowly to taste it.

 | 




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 7: Deliciously Eating the Elf Slave (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I poured the saliva in my mouth inside Eve’s mouth, and since my body was on top of her body, my saliva was flowing down and entering her mouth. To make sure she’d drink everything, I made sure that there wasn’t a gap between our mouth and I also signaled my intention with a look.

「nnmnnu!」

A gulping sound was heard from Eve’s throat. Slowly releasing her lips, it looked like she’d completely swallowed all my saliva. That fact made me feel aroused. 

I stroked her hair while giving her a light kiss.

「I love obedient girls like you.」

As I stroked her head, I was also rubbing her breast. Suddenly, Eve’s expression twisted as if she was suffering pain. That reminds me, her breasts were swollen because I sucked them too much.

「Since you’re a good girl, let me get rid of the pain. 」

I activated a recovery magic while caressing her breasts. Her reddened breasts and nipples were quickly recovering their original color.

「Ah….」

Feeling surprised, Eve grabbed her own breasts. She was probably just confirming whether the pain was really gone, but her action was very erotic.

My penis was already standing erect.

Eve’s dress was a set of one piece dress and a string bikini panty. Since I’d already removed the ribbon on her chest a while ago, it would be simple to take the dress off. To advance things to the next step, I was about to take off her one piece dress.

「Ah, ah, ahhh…」

The sound of Eve’s struggling voice reverberated into the room. She wanted to resist, but she also understood she couldn’t.

Her dress appeared easy to take off, but when actually removing it, it took some time since there were parts squeezed under her back. It wasn’t so easy to remove another person’s clothes. I learned a new thing today.

「Eve, your body is really beautiful.」

I threw her one piece dress down the bed, and then separated from her to look at her whole body. Her posture as she crossed her arms to hide her chest while blushing was so enchanting that it almost made me cum on the spot. My gaze nearly locked on her elastic breasts again, but I held it back and thought that it was about time to enjoy the main dish. 

When I placed my hands on her string bikini panty, I noticed that Eve was also paying attention to it. While showing it to her, I entangled my fingers on the string and slowly pulled it to undo the knot.

「Ahh!」

The knots on both ends had been untied, and her unfastened panty was now just a cover. Feeling my excitement was reaching its peak, I slowly took a deep breath. A girl’s private part was just underneath that cloth.

I moved my fingers so slowly and pulled the cloth with both hands. The feeling of the cloth was that of a high-class material, but I didn’t care about that. But since her panty was sandwiched by her lovely butt, I couldn’t pull it out.

「Eve, raise your butt.」

Eve tightly closed her eyes and then raised her body without saying anything. Taking that chance, I removed her panty and then threw it down the bed. I fixed my eyes on her straight-up naked body as she was lying with her thighs tightly shut. Eve’s pose—her right hand covering her breasts and left hand hiding her private area—was very seductive.

I slipped my hands between her legs. Perhaps she didn’t understand my intention, or she didn’t want to do it, Eve did not open her legs.

「Open your legs.」

When I said it in a commanding tone, it seemed like she didn’t have any intention of disobeying it. Strength left her legs, and she opened them. I grabbed her arms to remove her hand which served as the last remaining cover of her body.

「Hoh.」

I made sure to thoroughly observe her completely bare private part. Her small amount of pubic hair was light gold in color, much lighter than the color of her hair. Her beautiful vertical slit was slightly wet.

In order to properly check her secret place, I bent her knees up and spread it. Burying my face between her legs, I observed the place where I would insert my dick in close distance.

「Don’t look……Please don’t look……」

Of course I’d look. Moreover, I’d lick it. I stuck out my tongue and poked to stimulate her slightly protruding mound. I could only see her bulging breasts from here, but I could hear lovely squeal beyond it. It was starting to get interesting so I poked it with my tongue again.

「Noo……Aaaahhh……」

I opened her tightly shut slit with a finger and casually casted a magic that had a flash light effect.  I must confirm the place where the penis should be inserted. I could see her pink clitoris that was still covered in skin, so I licked it with the tip of my tongue.

「Aaaahhh?!」

Her legs were trembling and I kissed the base of her clitoris. This time, I slid my tongue at her clitoris in circles, slowly and carefully teasing her. The stimulation from my action caused me to feel like my head was boiling hot.

「You can’t!…you…doing such thing, you can’t!…」

I didn’t understand what it was she was telling that I couldn’t do, but I wasn’t really interested about it, so I continued licking. I slid my whole tongue towards her intimate area up and down, gently caressing it. A faint saltiness was transmitted to my tongue.

I kissed the lips of her vagina, inserted my tongue inside it, and firmly pressed my tongue on her clitoris. I looked at Eve to see her reaction. Eve was breathing heavily—no, it was closer to moaning, and it filled me with desire like never before.

「I can’t endure it anymore.」

I readied my erect cock so that Eve could see it, and then grabbed her knees to insert it in a normal position. She had already given up on hiding her chest, and she appeared to be crying with both hands on her face. I pushed my body on top of Eve and then moved the hands covering her face and gave her a deep kiss. That was like my greeting before entering inside her.

「Eve, I’m going in.」

「……Eh?」

She finally seemed to have understood her situation. Just as she opened her big and round eyes wide, it immediately changed into an expression of fright.

「Wait, please wait!」

「It might hurt a bit but endure it. What, it’s only going to be painful once, and I will do it as gentle as possible.」　

It was certainly a reassuring line from a virgin.  I wouldn’t say something like ‘its my first time, so I’m not sure about it’.

「But!! Mother said! She told me!」

From Eve’s desperate tone, I judged that she wasn’t just trying to escape, so I waited for her to continue. Perhaps she didn’t think I’d hear her out, Eve calmed down slightly, and she appeared to be looking for the right words.

「That, I’ll get pregnant.……My mother, told me.……That’s why, you can’t do it. Please spare me from that. I beg you. Please let me off. I’ll, get pregnant.」

……I’ll get pregnant.

What pleasant words… I thought my dick was already fully erect, but then I felt that there was still a room to grow. I felt hot. My penis was becoming hotter as if it was going to burn.

I thought from the bottom of my heart that I wanted to make her pregnant. That was without a doubt the real sex. To 「Learn about women」 was without a doubt telling me to make a woman pregnant.

「There’s no problem even if you get pregnant. You can give birth for as many children. As long as you obey me, I’ll protect you and your child.」

「nnnnmm!?」

I gave her a forceful kiss. I pressed Eve’s body that was trying to get up again and then kissed her again.

I’ll put it inside her. I’ll put it inside her. I’ll put it inside her.

I couldn’t hold back my impatience any longer.

I couldn’t see the place to insert it because it was dark, but I looked for her hole while rubbing her wet private part with my penis. Also because I couldn’t quite feel a thing from my already impatient penis, I couldn’t find the place to insert it.

「Noo!……I dont, want this!……」

Eve completely covered her face with both hands. I pulled my body which was in a missionary position, and confirmed the opening of her vagina with light magic, and then pushed the tip of my penis against it. This should be the right place.

「Evee!!!」

At the same time as I shouted, I dropped my body and started inserting my penis.

「Nooooo! Please don’t put it in! Noo! Aaaahhhhh!!」

Eve’s piercing scream was nothing more than a pleasant music now. And then, there was an indescribable feeling, as if hitting into something. There was no doubt it was the symbol of Eve’s virginity.

「Eve! It might be slightly painful, but endure it!」

「Eh?…?! Ahhhhhhhh! It hurts!!!」

I’d pierced her innocence.

I unconsciously hugged Eve’s body upon getting that reaction and sought to indulge in kissing her lips. I violated Eve’s mouth with my tongue, and sucked her tongue that was trembling due to pain. 

When I pulled my body and looked at our joint area, there was fresh blood slightly dripping.

While being held by lust which made me numb to other feelings, the only feeling that was transmitted to my head was that it felt good.

「It hurtss!! Uhhhhh..」

I held down Eve’s shoulders to stop her from turning and moving her body. And by doing so, I leaned forward, leading my penis deeper inside her.

「Ahh, Eve, you’re very good! I’m glad that I bought you!」

I moved deeper, and deeper inside. That was the only thing on my mind.

「uunnnanhh…uuhhhh……no……uuuuhhhh……」

Ignoring Eve who was sniffling, I dropped my waist and finally succeeded in pushing my whole penis inside her.

I’d finally completely joined with Eve.

It happened the moment I thought of that. Assaulted by the intense feeling of ejaculation, I hugged Eve.

「Ghuaaahh! Eve! Eve!!」

Staying in a position with my head over her shoulders, I released my semen inside her vagina.

Perhaps because I had forbidden himself from masturbating for eight days, the ejaculation continued without ending, and the fact that it would be loosed inside a girls vagina further stimulated more to come out.

I could tell that my saliva was dripping due to the pleasant feeling of orgasm. Somehow pulling back my consciousness that was drowning in the sea of pleasure, I moved the saliva falling off my mouth inside Eve’s mouth.

From all the saliva and ejaculation, the feeling of my body connected with her intensified, and I was assaulted by the sensation of ejaculating for the second time.

I couldn’t think of anything anymore.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 8: Deliciously Ate the Elf Slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


After calming down my rough breathing, I slowly moved my body up, and then returned to a missionary position while still connected to Eve. 

「uuuuhhh……Hik……Hik……uuuhhh……」

I stroked Eve’s hair while she was crying like a child. She shook her head to the side telling that she didn’t want to do it anymore, and then turned her face to the side to avoid me.

After ejaculating twice at the start, I sought her body two more times and poured everything inside her.

Feeling that she’d be too pitiful if I still blamed her for her action, I only continued stroking her hair without saying anything. Sliding my fingers on her deep honey-blonde felt very great.

「Eve.」

There was no response. Maybe she was afraid because I was looking at her, Eve was just trembling while suppressing the sound of her crying.

Probably because I’d calmed down now, her figure appeared very pitiful.

「I guess that’s enough for today.」

「….Its, over…..?」 asked Eve.   

Ensuring my voice sounded as gentle as possible, I spoke softly.

「Yes, you’ve done well. Good girl.」

I patted her head and kissed her cheek. Eve was looking relieved, and then she moved her eyes to her lower half which was still attached to me

Showing off to her, I moved my upper body away. The lower half of our body—still joined in a missionary position—was revealed.  It was messy due to the semen flowing out of her vagina. In front of Eve who was looking with a greatly surprised expression, I decided to pull my penis out.

「Ahh!」

At the same time as my penis separated from her, semen spilled out from inside Eve’s vagina. The slight red color mixed in it was likely her blood.

「Hahaha! I sure came a lot.」

Thinking about it, four batches worth of semen was released inside her.  I felt like I could still go on if I wanted to, but there were still many opportunities from now on.　

The nervousness from losing my virginity and the fact that it was the first time I had sex made me feel so tired. I really wanted to sleep.

I’d like to take a bath if possible, but I didn’t feel like moving since there was some distance from here to the bath. When I wiped the fluids on the sheets, Eve imitated it and started to wipe the semen coming out of her vagina.

「Eve, we’re going to sleep.」

Since I ordered Tesh in advance, there were two beds arranged in the room. The bed where we had sex and a bed where we would sleep.

I stood up to switch to the other bed. But, Eve was only in a daze without standing up. I might’ve overdone it. Eve looked like she didn’t know what she should do.

「Hey, stand up.」

Eve tried to stand up, but she fell…

「Ah!」

Just in case, I extended my arms to her and kept her from falling. Her feet were unsteady, so I had the feeling that she’d fall down.

「You can’t stand? I guess it can’t be helped.」

I turned her body and carried her in my arms all the way to the bed, and placed her on top.

「There should be a change of clothes there. Wear it.」

Our sleepwear was folded on the bed.  Mine was the same type I’d been wearing before we had sex, and her sleepwear was a negligee. It was less erotic, but its frills were kind of cute and were more fitting for her age.

「You look good in that.」

Even though I praised her, she only gave a subtle strained smile. Well, I guess being praised by the man who raped her was not something to be happy about.

「Let’s sleep. Come in here.」

I slipped into the bed, and waved at her. Opening the blanket, I tapped on the bed to tell her to come inside. Of course, we were going to sleep together.

「Eh…..? That…..」

「We are going to sleep together. Come here quickly.」

Recognizing it as an order, Eve entered the bed with a resigned expression. We were both resting on a long pillow. I embraced her closer, just lightly so I wouldn’t feel aroused.

「Since I’ve been the one kissing you today,  you give me a kiss before we sleep.」　

Eve’s green eyes wandered around. Even though it couldn’t be helped if I were the one to initiate the kiss, it seemed like she never imagined that she’d be the one to give a kiss.

Eve slowly brought her face closer with a resolute expression, but she moved slightly back and forth before moving closer again. I thought of giving her a surprise kiss, but I gave up on the idea since there wouldn’t be any meaning if she was not the one to kiss.

「Let’s see… Say ‘Good night, Master’ before kissing me. Now, do it, Eve. Start by saying good night.」

After saying that, I closed my eyes and changed my pose similar to a girl waiting to be kissed. I was a maiden.

「Good……good night.……Master」

There was a feeling of her lips touching, but unfortunately, it immediately disappeared. Well, if she gave me a deep kiss here, a second round would’ve started. It may have been good that she only gave a light kiss.

「Yes, sleep well.」

On the bed, I activated a magic to close all the curtains in the room, and then the room was covered in darkness. The thick curtains blocked the light from the stars and moon, so much that I couldn’t even see Eve’s face beside me.

In this world where clocks didn’t exist, I had no way of knowing how much time had passed.

Probably due to the excitement of my first experience, I couldn’t sleep despite feeling sleepy. In the end, Eve fell asleep first. The breathing sounds that she was making was very cute.

When I tried to touch her softly, I saw that her back was facing here. She probably slept with her back towards me. Since her back was facing here, I stroked the back of her head. If I were to move my arms around and grope her chest, I felt like I would feel aroused, so I gave up the idea.

「nnnm……」

After stroking her hair for a while, she turned over to my direction. And when I continued stroking her hair again, this time she buried her head in my chest.

She seemed to be mumbling something in her sleep. I focused my ears and tried to catch it.

「…………Mother……」

She was just talking in her sleep, but her voice was filled with sadness.

「Mother, huh.」

Living as the eldest son of a marquis for twelve years had changed the way I think closer to a noble. If necessary, I could easily dispose a commoner, and I’d really done it multiple times. Even this time, I didn’t feel much guilt from forcing myself on Eve.

But, I wanted to at least grant her wish as best as I could. Perhaps she would become proactive in sex.

While thinking about what I should write on the letter to Gandran Group, my consciousness disappeared in the darkness.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 9: A Bright Morning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When I woke up, I felt an unpleasant crispy feeling on my body. It was probably due to the fluids that stuck and dried up from last night.

Sighing, I activated a magic to open the curtains. And then, the morning sunlight shined into the room. Gazing at the window while feeling groggy from waking up, I suddenly heard someone knocking the door. I answered to let the person know that I was awake, but only a voice came back. 

「Wilk-sama. Your bath has been prepared.」

The timing was perfect.

I left the room in a good mood and headed towards the bath.

「Tesh, well done from this early in the morning. I just thought of wanting to take a bath when I woke up. Thanks to you, I’m able to start the day feeling great.」

「I’m very glad.」

After finishing my morning bath, I took the breakfast served by Tesh.

Eve was apparently taking a bath using my leftover bath water. A slave like her would never eat in the same table as me in the first place.

「Before going back to the castle, I’m thinking of writing a letter. I’m sending it to the slave trader yesterday.」

「As I expected, Young Master didn’t like that girl?」

「No, she was quite good.」

「Then?」

「That girl has a mother. She’s probably being sold as a slave too. Considering that her daughter is so beautiful, there’s no doubt the mother should be quite a beauty herself. If her separated mother was together with her, she’ll probably become more obedient to me.」

Long story short, I wanted to have both mother and daughter. Of course, I wouldn’t say that aloud.

When I explained it to Tesh, he asked in a lowered voice while wearing a doubtful look.

「About that, does that girl know about it?」

「No, I didn’t tell her. That’s my idea. Why do I have to tell it to her?」

Perhaps feeling relieved from hearing my answer, Tesh’s expression relaxed.

「It’s exactly as Young Master said, there’s no need to let her know about it.」

「Then, why did you ask?」

I could somehow guess the answer, but I still asked him. As expected, Tesh’s expression became unclear, and then he apologized first before speaking of the reason.

「It’s not that rare for men to have a feeling with the woman that they’ve had sex with. This is especially the case for their first time partners. I was just checking whether Young Master was holding sympathy towards that girl. It wouldn’t have been good if Young Master pitied her as far as even giving a promise to let her meet with her mother. Please forgive my rash judgment for causing Young Master to feel displeased.」

「There’s no need for you to worry. You have a point. I forgive you.」

Tesh deeply lowered his head. Then, according to Tesh, the slave trader Doran was apparently staying at an inn inside the city last night. I had a servant write a letter on my behalf and sent the servant to deliver it.

「What kind of treatment shall we give Eve? I think it will be good to let her do her job as a slave and just let her be without assigning any other work.」

Eve was originally a village girl. Leaving behind a person who did not have any knowledge about the proper etiquette of nobles near you would cause the other nobles look down on you for not being able to employ a better person. Face is important for nobles, so I couldn’t leave her beside me.

「Hm. It would be problematic if her beautiful hands turned rough from doing difficult jobs.」

Taking that into account, why was her hand so soft and beautiful despite living in a village? Villagers usually took agricultural works. Well, there were probably many elves that could use a healing magic, and they might’ve raised her with great care. She’d been raised with so much care, but in the end she became a slave. Life sure doesn’t always turn the way people want it to.

「She’s a girl with a beautiful appearance, so I suggest avoiding places with men. Although she is Young Master’s slave, it doesn’t change the fact that she’s a slave. There’s no knowing what might happen.」

「Your right.」

I could easily tear a commoner apart if they were to touch my belongings, but even magic wouldn’t be able to reverse something that had already happened. I didn’t have any intention of placing her in a place filled with men. Still, I felt like it was a waste letting a slave just dally around.

「That reminds me, does Eve know how to read and write?」

The common language in the Levios Kingdom was called Elluo, and it was a common language within the continent. Incidentally, the continent where Levios Kingdom was located in was called Elluo Continent. The name of the language was basically the same as the continent’s name.

I heard that the literacy wasn’t very high, and only about thirty percent of the ordinary people could read and write.

It was unknown whether Eve was literate since she lived in a village.

「I heard she could read and write. That was what that slave trader said.」

So he mentioned about it. Honestly, I was only looking at the face and chest of the slaves, so I ignored what they talked about for the most part. But if she could read and write, then there was just the right job for her.

「In that case, her job should be copying. If her writing is not clear, let her practice with some minor documents, and when she has gotten used to it let her copy the books that I’m interested in.」

Apparently, Quordentz family was a house with a nearly three hundred years of history. There were many documents in the castle’s warehouse. These documents included the records about the wars, the diaries of the previous family heads, and information regarding the nearby territories.

There weren’t many amusements in this world, and reading those records was one of the hobbies that I’d found. However, these records were valuable so they couldn’t be taken out of the warehouse. Whenever I wanted to read, I’d have to stay at the warehouse. Obviously, I couldn’t just stay there all the time, so I sometimes had a servant copy the records that I was interested in, and then reading them before sleeping became my habit. If I assign this job to Eve, I wouldn’t need to find another servant to do the job anymore.

「Understood. I’ll make the adjustments.」

「Right. And, one more thing. Its about Eve.」

Seeing me lower my voice, Tesh moved his face closer. It was something I didn’t want to say aloud.

「Eve will be often in contact with the servants from now on. So, there’s one thing I’d like you to take note about.」

「Please say it.」 

「As much as possible, treat her coldly.」

「May I ask the reason? If Young Master doesn’t want to say it, that is also fine. But, knowing the reason will allow me to better perform the task.」

Well, he was right. I had no intention of hiding it from him anyway.

「I intend to treat Eve gently during the night. If I were to keep doing it by force, it wouldn’t be good later on once I get a wife.」

「Your exactly right, Young Master.」

「However, at this rate, she’ll never be obedient to me. That’s why I need to make her understand. As she spends every day being treated coldy by the servants, without ever being needed by anyone, and without anyone being nice to her, she’ll then eventually realise it. That she’s only needed when sleeping with me. That she’s only treated nicely when sleeping with me. And sleeping with me is exactly her happiness.」

Tesh looked like he understood my intention and he slowly nodded his head.

「I don’t want to force her to be obedient. What I want is for her to be the one to become obedient to me. That’s my objective.」

「Young Master’s intention, I’ve certainly understood it. Please leave it to your servant.」

Tesh would be able to properly use the servants to thoroughly corner Eve.

My only job was to embrace her.

Finishing my breakfast, I returned to the castle in high spirits.

Chapter 10: Castle’s Garden
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When I returned to Nyuneri Castle, I instructed Tesh to arrange a room for Eve and then returned to my room. I just took my lunch, so I was thinking of resting for a short while.

「Welcome back, Young Master.」

「Mm, good work.」

The maid cleaning the room politely lowered her head. It seemed that I returned too early.

「Young Master, I’m very sorry. I haven’t finished cleaning the room yet.」

「That seems to be the case. Well, I have nothing to do here anyway. Maybe I’ll go to the garden. You can continue cleaning.」

「Thank you.」

Turning around and just as I was about to leave the room,  a voice sounded from behind.

「I just remembered, a package addressed to Young master seemed to have arrived. Two boxes came from the clothing and fashion company that sells goods to young master. Has young master already confirmed it?」

「Oh! I see, where is it?」

The thing that I’d ordered seemed to have arrived. Since I’ve been eagerly waiting for it, my voice unconsciously turned a level higher.

「I believe it should be in the inspection room.」

「Young master, the inspection has already been finished. If Young master needs it, this servant will go and bring it.」

We were talking near the entrance, and another servant seemed to have been listening to us. I turned around, and there was a male servant standing upright.

「I see. Then bring it to the garden.」

「Understood.」

Seeing him give a bow, I then advanced my steps towards the garden.

Nyuneri Castle was surrounded by a wall, but there was around two hundred meters space between the wall and the castle. A garden was arranged there. There were flower beds, ponds, and a house to drink a tea.

Also because the gardener had been doing a great job, it was possible to enjoy the beautiful scenery that matched with the season, so it was also my favorite spot. Additionally, there were also four seasons in this world.

「Big Brother.」

Just as I neared the house to view the flowers, there was already a person inside.

「Fanny. So your here.」

「Yes. Did Big Brother also come here for a tea?」

When I replied yes, Fanny’s personal maids quickly prepared a seat.

While being led, I sat down on the seat beside Fanny.

Fanny.She was a daughter born between Marquis Quordentz and his legal wife. In short, she was my biological younger sister in this world.

Her eyes and hair was a clear blue, looking like the spring skies. Different from my previous world, there was a large variety of hair colors in this world including green, pink, and even red. It was just like in an anime. Incidentally, just like Fanny, my hair was also blue which I inherited from my mother, but my eyes were the same silver as my father’s.

「Big Brother, I heard you stayed at the mansion yesterday. It was unfortunate, I wanted to study with Big Brother.」

It seemed like she didn’t know about the matter about me losing my virginity. 

I’m sorry, my adorable little sister. Your big brother was studying a different thing last night. 

「I didn’t know. I did something bad then.」

「When I tried going to the residence, the servants stopped me. That’s why I want to be together with Big Brother today.」

Fanny’s smiling face was very charming. My act of being the good brother since she was young had succeeded, and Fanny grew up with a brother complex.

She was my only sibling, so I’d want to get along with her. Maybe it was because I had the memory of my previous life, I feel sexual desire even though she was my sister. That’s why I always made sure to pay extra attention to my actions so that I wouldn’t get hated.

「Study, huh. I remember that you like stories about history.」

「Yes. Big Brother’s stories are very interesting. I wonder if I can visit Big Brother’s room after dinner?」

Until yesterday, I’d been telling her stories about history before going to bed. I would normally talk about our family history which I found in the  warehouse in an entertaining way. My plan was to make her interested in history so that there would be more servants who would copy the documents in the warehouse.

「Eh…? to, today?」

「Oh…? Is Big Brother going to the mansion again today? In that case, I also want to go with Big Brother.」

This was problematic.

Since having experienced my first time with Eve yesterday, my desire towards a woman’s body was growing. In my previous world, I often heard of the saying that ‘a monkey who has learned how to masturbate will masturbate till death’. I was currently in the middle of experiencing the meaning of those words. I really wanted to have sex immediately.

「No, I won’t go to the mansion…」

「Then, I’ll visit Big Brother’s room after dinner.」

My little sister gave a lovely smile. She was really cute. 

But wait a minute.

When we were talking about history in the name of studying, in most cases, Fanny would sleep on my bed. She loved sleeping with me. Unfortunately, the ‘sleeping’  was just referring to normal sleeping.

If Fanny slept beside me like she usually did tonight… There was no way I could do it with Eve with my little sister just sleeping beside me.

「Big Brother, I can’t…?」

Her gesture with her hand under her chin and head slightly tilted to the side was too cute. I gave her a smile and stroked her long hair.

「Of course you can. Let’s talk about lots interesting stories again today.」

Good bye, Eve. We’d have to postpone todays love making.

「Young Master. I’ve brought your package.」

While I was swearing to control myself today, the servant from a while ago showed with a wooden box. I ordered the servant to place it on top of the table.

「Big Brother, what is that?」

「This is the uniform for the servants.」

Nowadays, the servant’s of our family were all wearing the same uniform. Back when I just reincarnated, they were wearing different kinds.

I suggested the uniformity of the clothes several years ago. At that time I was already acquainted with a clothing and fashion company, so I had them make a simple uniform.  

The servants expressed high support towards the idea. As for why, it was because the uniform was a loan from the Quordentz house. In the beginning, since there was a rule to dress in a way fitting a servant of a Marquis, they had to spend a considerable amout of money for their clothing. Although not much, the expenses for their clothes were apparently also included in their salary. Since that had changed into a loan, they no longer needed to spend money to buy expensive clothes. That was especially the case for the lower class servants. They were especially thankful.

Incidentally, the amount deducted from their salary for their clothing expenses and the amount required to prepare the uniforms was more or less equal. As for which one costed more, father said our expenses was slightly higher.

「Is their uniform going to change?」

「This time I tried to change the uniform for the women. After all, the current design is not very good.」

Fanny’s personal maids appeared to be looking at the boxes with interest. Their current maid uniform was like a male waiter’s uniform in my previous world when it comes to the design, and they also lacked the appeal. When thinking of maids, I thought it should be a maid uniform. So I had them made the test version of the uniform first.  

Among the two boxes, one was a slim maid uniform that emphasized utility while the other one was a maid uniform filled with frills. Fanny smiled while looking at the frilly maid uniform.

「This dress here looks very pretty. I’d like to try wearing it.」

「That’s the model uniform. However, it is difficult to move with those clothes, so I asked them to create a simpler version and have them bring it. Unfortunately, the size is for adults so you won’t be able to wear it.」

The truly unfortunate thing was that I couldn’t make Eve wear it. Their size didn’t match.

The surrounding maids looked at the simple version maid clothes that they would be wearing with great interest.

I called out towards them.

「I’m thinking of having some of you try out the new maid uniform and hear your opinions about it. If it is hard to work while wearing the uniform, then it will have to be modified. I’d like to hear your opinions about that. Don’t worry I won’t rebuke you.」

The maids all turned towards me and bowed. There were several maids who were so eager to test it out, so I felt that the design perhaps wasn’t bad.

After drinking a tea with Fanny for a while, I returned to my room. It seemed like the maid had finished cleaning the room.

「This will be the new maid uniform, what do you think about it?」

I showed to the maid the maid uniforms lined up on top of the short round table in front of the sofa.

「Its very attractive. Can I unfurl it?」 

「I don’t mind.」

The maid opened the maid uniform carefully as if it was a fragile object and then stood in front of a full-length mirror while placing the uniform in front of her body. Looking at her taking the sleeve and extending her arms, the sized looked fitted to her.

「The size looks perfect. Do you want to try wearing it?」

「Is it fine?」

「Yes. Without actually wearing it, there’s no way to know whether they fit you. I permit you to go and change.」

「Understood. Excuse me.」

The door closed and I was the only one left in the room. I sank into the sofa and waited for a while.

The bed that was originally the place where I’d have sex with Eve tonight entered my sight. When I thought about that, I felt very annoyed. 

Fanny was very lovely. However, her loveliness was one that I couldn’t touch. Having tasted the pleasure of sex, I wanted so badly to touch a beauty.

If only I could call Eve to my room tonight… I’d have been able to do this and that as much as I want.

While thinking about those matters, the door was knocked.

I gave the permission to enter, and the maid not long ago was standing wearing a frilly maid dress.

「Excuse me. I’ve changed into the maid uniform.」

……Why, was she wearing that one?

Come to think of it I felt like she left the room with two maid uniforms. She perhaps took both since I didn’t tell her that the simpler version was the one planned to be their uniform. 

「I think, it’s a very pretty uniform. It’s my first time wearing this kind of dress, so, um, does it look good?  I wonder if I didn’t wear it wrong. The head maid also checked it, but since it is a new uniform I am afraid that Young Master may find something wrong with the way I dressed it.」

The size was just the right one, neither tight nor loose. The maid turned her waist, and the long skirt swayed along gently.

「Its good, very good.」

I was too moved. This was just wonderful! 

I unconsciously let out a smile.

「I’m very happy to receive a praise from Young Master.」

The maid bowed with the palms of her hands placed near her thighs. She really looked like a maid and it was good.

I suddenly felt my desire rising up.

「Well then, try moving around with those clothes. I don’t mind even if they get dirty. They are uniforms, after all.」

「I understand.」

Then, the maid started on arranging the bedsheets. My eyes somehow followed her movements. Speaking of bed-making, I had the impression that it would usually be two people spreading the sheets, but there was only a single maid here.

I looked at her as her figure bent forward arranging the bed. 

Her posture was quite arousing. Looking at the figure of a maid with her body bent forward from behind was very erotic. Her ass was especially good, it waws sticking out as if it was asking me to penetrate it.

「How much time is there before dinner?」

「Young Master, you didn’t take lunch just a while ago?」

「Ah, yes. I did. Well, I just wanted to ask.」

What I was curious about was not the dinner but the time we had before dinner. How much time was there before dinner?

Fanny would visit after dinner, so there wouldn’t be any time. If it was right now? There was enough time. There shouldn’t be anyone entering this room until dinner time.

I slowly moved my body up from the sofa.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 11: Eating the Maid (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I stood up without making any sound just like a wild animal. Incidentally, my penis also stood up.

In front was a maid arranging the bed with her ass moving around.

Let me see, what was her name?

I had several personal maids who clean my room, so I couldn’t quite match her name with her face. I closed my eyes and tried to remember it, and then I smelled the scent of a flower in the room.

I remember! This maid was the girl who always placed a flower inside the room. 

There were several maids tasked to clean my room, and each one with their own way of cleaning the room. Perhaps she loved flowers she always arranged flowers after cleaning. There were beautiful flowers with vibrant petals in the flower vase at the corner of the room. I didn’t know the name of the flower.

After remembering her cleaning peculiarity, I also remembered her name.

Her name was Minith. From what I could remember, she was a commoner living in the castle town and a maid who commuted to work in the castle.

People of common birth hired in the castle were mostly females. Their work were mainly behind-the-scene jobs such as cleaning and cooking. It was the kind of work that anybody could perform, so anyone could be accepted as long as they could perform satisfactorily. Naturally, the beautiful ones were the priority. Similar to the matter about losing my virginity, the number of beautiful maids hired would increase considering that they might be used for sex education. 

Minith was also one of the maids who went through that process. Her speech was very proper right now, but not too long ago she was still being lectured in front of the head maid. Her age should be around sixteen years old. And, her appearance also looked to be around that age. There wasn’t a labor standard act in this world, so even kids could work.

I slowly closed on her back silently without making a sound. Even with her bent posture, I could see that she was slightly taller than me. There was around a ten centimeter difference in our height. Her slightly permed chestnut colored hair was supported by a hair clip, and it looked like it was rolled around the back of her head. She probably tied it up to not disturb her while she was working, but her nape was exposed, so it was quite alluring.

「Young Master?」

Minith noticed that I was looking at her and turned around. She looked at me curiously with her dark eyes.

「I just wanted to look at you wearing the uniform for a bit. Can you stand straight and look here?」

「I understand.」

Without doubting anything, Minith turned towards me with her posture straight. I pretended to check her uniform and then moved my eyes towards her chest. Sadly, Minith’s chest was smaller than Eve who was four years younger than her. That was probably due to racial differences.  Even so, it looked just about average for her age, so it was fine. 

While I was looking at her face, she gave me a slight smile. 

Adorable! It was a smile that made me feel a sincere warmth.

「Turn around and let me see your back.」

「Yes.」

Minith turned her body around with her back turned towards me.  Her back was completely defenseless.  Ah, I couldn’t endure it. My dick was already standing hard. I felt like it was so erect as if it had already recovered from having ejaculated four times last night.

「Minith.」

「…! Yes..?」

I gently held her back without putting any strength. Just as I imagined, she was indeed slightly taller than me.

「Y-Young master!?」

Flustered, Minith just stood straight up without turning around. I could feel her arms slightly shaking, but there was no feeling that she wanted to run away.

I continued hugging her without saying anything. Her female smell tickled my nose, and it stimulated the desire within me. Pushing my face on her back, I took a deep breath and smelled her scent.

「Um, Young Master?」

She asked with a bewildered tone, but I ignored her. Staying silent, I increased the strength in the arms hugging her.

「Nnn…」

There really wasn’t any resistance. It was probably the difference between a forced slave like Eve and an employed person who was ready to serve a member of a Marquis.

 I removed my arms around her back and placed it on her shoulders, and then I turned her around. Facing Minith, I hugged her once more.

The difference in our height was not that much of a bother. At a distance so close that I could easily kiss her, Minith showed a confused expression.

「You don’t want? I want to hold you, Minith.」

Suddenly, I heard Minith gasping. Moving my arms around her waist, I pulled her body closer to me.

「Young Master. There are many other women more beautiful than me in the castle. A very common girl like me is not deserving of Young Master’s favor. Just having my name remembered is already an undeserved honor.」

From her tone, I could feel she was speaking her true feelings. She was happy that I remembered her name, but she felt that a common girl like her was unworthy to receive my liking. 

It was good that she was humble. This further made me want to make her mine.

Now, how should I persuade her. It would be boring to say  「Bitch！A mere commoner is trying to resist a noble?! Shut up and open your legs!」.  That would be quicker though.

This time I’d prefer an intimate sex with both of us seeking each other. I’d already enjoyed forcing someone who couldn’t resist last night. Its very stimulating to force someone who resists, but Minith probably wouldn’t even if I raped her.

In short, the best way was to coax her, and then we would have a passionate sex.

「A very ordinary commoner, huh.」

「Yes.」

That was probably her complex. She might qualify as beautiful in the town, but there were so many maids more beautiful than her here in the castle. I also knew several maids who were more beautiful than her, so it wasn’t necessarily wrong. That is to say, Minith was a maid who lacked a distinctive character.

「That’s not true.」

Fortunately, I had something I could use to coax her. All that was left was to speak gently without being embarrassed.

「In the castle, you are the only one arranging flowers in this room. 」

I looked towards the flower vase. In there was the red flower which Minith arranged, blooming in its full glory as if displaying itself. 

Before she could speak, I continued my words.

「Your not just one of the many maids. Your an important, and an irreplaceable woman who always served me with utmost effort, and even added color to this room. Minith.」

「Young Master……! I don’t deserve such praise……!」

I showed her a smile, stuck her body closer to me, and then shortened our distance so much that I could feel her breath. It shouldn’t just be my imagination that her cheeks were blushing.

「Let me say it one more time. Minith, I want you. Is that fine?」

「Yes…」

I gently kissed Minith’s lips as she was looking at me with a captivated expression. Kissing sounds resounded inside, making the atmosphere hot. 

When I hugged her back to give her a deep kiss, surprisingly, she also hugged me too.

Her superior had noticed the efforts of a low-class servant like her and even praised her. There was no one who wouldn’t feel touched, regardless of their gender. Being in a higher position in itself was an advantage, just like how a fast food restaurant’s owner was popular with the high school girl part-timers.

On top of that, my handsome smile that could make even the other nobles feel envious. It was more than enough to make an innocent sixteen-year-old young girl fall in love.

I was very grateful to my mother in this world for giving birth to such a handsome face.

Chapter 12: Eating the Maid (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


After I enjoyed locking tongues with Minith, I guided her towards the bed. But, she stopped on her feet.

「……I think, it’s still too early.」

「Its because my sister will be coming here tonight.」

「Ah, so Fanny-sama will be coming here.」

Anyone in the castle knew that Fanny would visit my room at night. 

「Young Master, I’m a commoner. Young Master who prefers cleanliness might……」

I couldn’t understand what she was trying to say, so I asked her to explain it.

According to her, the commoners during this period would only go to the public bathhouse around once a week. She said that my personal servants always cleaned their body as much as possible. And, she also said that the last time she took a bath was two days ago.

Long story short, her body wasn’t clean, so she said that it might displease me.

If I sought her out during the night, she’d be allowed to enter the bath in the castle as a privilege for being called during the night, but that wouldn’t apply if we did it during the morning. That was why she was feeling troubled.

「There’s no problem.」

Since the area where Nyuneri was located in was a dry region, it was enough to take a bath at least once a week. Especially in this current period, people wouldn’t sweat by much. Back when I sneaked out to walk in the castle town, the people there didn’t look that dirty, only a bit dusty.

When I smelled her body a while ago, I didn’t smell anything bad in particular. Instead, I felt aroused by her female smell.

「I won’t feel displeased just because of something like that.」

A sound of metal snapping was heard as I said those words. I’d activated a magic to lock the door from far away. This way there wouldn’t be any servants entering the room.  However, I wouldn’t close the curtains since I wanted to see her disordered maid clothes.

「Now only the two of us are here」

「Yes, Young Master.」

I sat on the bed first and patted beside me to indicate for her to sit there. Minith walked closer nervously, sat down beside me, and turned her body to look at me. As if being sucked by those eyes, I embraced her and gave her an intense kiss.

「nnnhmm……aaahhhn……nnnchu………haaaa……」

Maybe she had grasped the technique on how to use her tongue from our kiss a while ago, I was able to fully savor her. While gently caressing her breast with my right hand and left hand resting on her shouders, I continued exploring her mouth.

「Young Masterr……nnmchu……chu………aaahnn」

Her seductive sweet voice sounded near my ear, and it was transmitted towards my dick. It felt good.  As if our bodies had become one through our tongues, I felt a hot mingling. I strengthened my left hand on her shoulder, and my right hand which was caressing her breast as if tracing its shape had gradually began to knead it.

Shortly after, Minith also moved her hands sitting on her thighs and placed it on both of my shoulders. She then slid her arms and moved it to cover my head. Her height was higher than mine, so her saliva flowed inside my mouth and further stimulated my desire.

「……cchu……nnn……chu……haa, haa……nnnmm!」

I sucked her mouth intensely, but Minith didn’t just stay passive. She returned it by sucking back. After indulging in a very long kiss, I reluctantly released her because I felt like I wanted to see her face. The scene when the thread of our saliva was hanging from our tongue was very arousing.

「haa, haa…….Young Master……」

「Minith……」

The young girl in maid uniform looked at me with passionate eyes. Just as I thought of removing my pants which was stretched forward, Minith suddenly placed her hands between my legs.

「……Young Master.…does it hurt?」

「It hurts, I can’t endure it anymore.」

Immediately, Minith moved her hands to undress my pants. She seemed to be having trouble removing another person’s clothes, so I helped her by throwing off my pants and everything I was wearing below. I was wearing a shirt, but my lower body was only an exposed dick. If others were to see this scene, it would’ve looked very silly.

「This is…Young Master’s……」

「This is very embarassing!」

She was staring so hard at it. Minith was observing my dick with eyes full of curiosity. The curtains were open, so my penis was completely revealed under the light of the day.

「Young Master, we have received education regarding these matters from the Head Maid.」

According to Minith, the head maid began teaching them about sexual matters during the time it was planned that I would lose my virginity. They didn’t have any actual training though.

「I have also learned of ways to please a man. Please leave it to me. I’ll do my best to satisfy Young Master.」

「Al-alright. I’m not really sure, but I’m leaving it to you. Don’t force yourself.」

I wasn’t aware that the head maid was teaching them about sexual matters behind my back. I imagined a silly scene in my mind: The maids were all lined up in a row looking at cucumbers and eggplants, and training on how to stimulate a man’s penis with their hands. They weren’t doing something like that, right?

Tesh told me back then that it was fine to choose from any of my personal maids. So they were really prepared.

While thinking of those things, Minith dropped her body towards my lower body.

This is, don’t tell me…

「Mi, Minith?」

「Excuse me.」

She sticked out her tongue and licked the back of my penis.

I unconciously let out a gasp. Her tongue was so warm and it felt great. Seeing my reaction, Minith move her tongue up and down on my penis. Her heavy breathing and panting due to her difficult position aroused me further.

「Minith, aaahh, lick, licking it there, its dirty.」

「Young Mas……nnmm」

As if enjoying my anxious reaction, Minith turned her eyes upward as she kissed the crown of my penis. Then, she covered the tip of my dick with her tongue before eventually putting it inside her mouth.

「Ah, ah, Minith, doing that…!」

My reaction, as if a maiden being given a cunnilingus, was very embarassing.  But my first experience of being given a blowjob was so impressive that it dispelled my embarrassment.

A young girl wearing a maid uniform was sucking my dick while panting. It made me question if there was any other scene more impressive than this.

The best thing was not the feeling of her tongue touching, or her teeth which sometimes bumped into my dick, but her figure as she was sucking my dick.

Led by the stimulating sensation from her blowjob, I immediately reached my limit.

「nnmhguu? nnnmbu?!」

The sound of coughing was heard from Minith’s mouth, and her back shook as she choked.

「Aahh! Minith! I’m cumming! Its coming out!」

Without caring about the strain on her, I was only thinking of filling Minith’s mouth with my semen. The semen that was coming out all went inside her mouth.

The fact that I was treating her like a toilet made me feel a sense of guilt, but at the same time, also a sense of dominance. Feeling a sense of immorality,  I also felt a sense of release.

As I followed my desires, I continued releasing my semen inside her mouth.

Chapter 13: Eating the Maid (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minith fixed her eyes on me, without releasing her mouth. After I finished ejaculating, I somehow managed to pull myself back from being taken by the pleasure.

Naturally, I stroked Minith’s head so slowly so that she could feel my warmth.

「Minith, that was very great. It was the best!」

「Fumm.」

She displayed an affectionate smile with her mouth still holding my dick. Seeing her smile, I felt relieved. Her figure joyfully holding my dick inside her mouth looked very sexy.

「nmm!」

Shortly after, there was a sound coming from her throat as she swallowed. Her expression contorted slightly before returning back to normal. And then, she released her mouth with a reluctant expression and placed both hands on her cheeks as she shyly averted her eyes.

「Heee… I swallowed everything.」

She stuck out her tongue and looked at me sheepishly. A white fluid was hanging from the corner of her mouth.

「You’re the best woman.」

She swallowed my semen. I felt something close to a sense of accomplishment that she’d completely accepted me. The feeling that she accepted my everything and I was accepted by her made my penis which was losing its erection after the ejaculation to boil up again.

I must release my semen into her deepest area and paint it with my color.

That was a resolution closer to an obsession.

In the instant I was controlled by desire, I raised Minith’s chin up and kissed her. She had just swallowed my semen so her mouth was kind of sticky, and the smell of semen reeked from her mouth. But that was only a trivial matter to me right now. Instead, it made me more excited.

「Ahn, Young Master!」

Our lips parted, and while carrying her with one hand, my other hand was starting to invade her skirt towards her unexplored garden. I didn’t move there immediately but savored the soft feeling from the soles of her feet, her calves, and her thighs.

Eve’s body was soft too, but Minith’s was softer. 

Minith’s body which was closer to a mature woman had more feminine curves than Eve whose body was still immature aside from her chest. Just as I touched her vaginal area, Minith shut her legs tight and caught my hands in between. They felt so soft and warm.

「Ahh, Young Master… that place… is dirty…」

「There’s no way its dirty.」

I wriggled my fingers on her soft thighs before opening it. When I gave her a light kiss on the forehead, her legs opened, giving way towards her secret garden.

「Ah…」

When I gave it a slight touch, Minith let out a sweet breath which reached my ears. And then, I could feel from my fingers that she was already soaking wet. I felt like teasing her for a bit. I rubbed her love nectar between my fingers which had become sticky and showed it to Minith.

A transparent fluid was pulled like a thread as I opened and closed between my fingers.

「Minith, what is this?」

「Ah! that is… please dont show it!」

「Getting yourself this wet, what a bad maid.」

Minith’s appearance as shook her head to the sides while blushing looked very lovely, causing me to be unable to endure it anymore. I placed strength on her arms and moved her body down on all fours. As if sensing my intention, or she also wanted it, she readily turned her ass towards me.

「A naughty maid needs punishment.」

Matching Minith who was crouching on the bed, I stood on my knees and held my erect dick. I patted her ass covered by her skirt and examined its feel. Her ass felt very soft and it was splendid. No wonder there were no shortage of molesters in my previous world. This feeling was absolutely wonderful.

「Young Master, the dress will get dirty.」

「Don’t worry about that.」

I pulled her waist closer and rolled her skirt up to confirm her garden. Her pussy was already soaking wet and sparkling, appearing very eager to swallow a cock. 

I wouldn’t take her clothes off. I wanted to thrust my dick inside a young girl wearing maid clothes. At this moment, as if I was struck by a lightning which made me understand a fact, I’d become certain of it. This was exactly the way of eating a maid.

I adjusted Minith’s spread thighs and matched it with my erect dick. After adjusting her height, I moved my dick just outside the entrance of her pussy.

「I’m going in, Minith.」

「Al, right. Young Master.」

I could feel something break as I slipped my dick inside her pussy.

「Ahhgg!!」

Minith strengthed the hands grabbing the sheets while crouching. The feeling of satisfaction from taking her first time caused my dick to grow harder.

「Are you alright?」

「Yes…! Young Master, I’m fine. It was my first time so I was just surprised.」

I was happy for her consideration. Our bodies further stuck close together as I slightly bent my body forward. I felt at ease just feeling her body from above her clothes.

「I’ll start moving slowly. Tell me if it hurts.」

After she nodded her head without a word, I lowered my body to penetrate her deepest area. The tip of my dick headed straight towards her deepest area while being stuck and entangled inside her vagina.

「nnhhnm～….uuuhh～nnnhmm.」

Watching Minith letting out seductive moans further stimulated my lust. I moved faster and faster, in order to reach deeper inside her. My mind felt like it was screaming at me to conquer her body.

Shorty after, I arrived at her deepest. My dick arrived whole inside her pussy. When I rolled her skirt upwards to look at our joined part, my dick had indeed gone completely inside her.

「Uhhh… Its, tight…」

I stopped moving and enjoyed the sensation inside her vagina as it pressed hard on my dick. Even without moving, it felt so great that I could ejaculate.

「fuuu, fuuuu……uuhhnn……」

I pulled Minith’s waist while she was letting out a sexy agonizing voice and made sure we wouldn’t separate. I firmly pressed myself on her to not separate from her moving vagina which was trying to push my dick back.

「Ahhnnn…」

I moved my idle hand to stimulate and enjoy her reaction. Teasing her in many different ways, she seemed to enjoy it when I pressed on her clitoris under my fingers. When I focused teasing her there, her moans were slowly changing to heavy breathing, and my palms were gradually getting wet.

「Haa……Haaa……Ahh, nmmm! haaa, ku…」

I wanted to thrust her, but I became too focused on playing with her pussy that I felt that I would cum with just the slightest movement.

「Young Master……Ahh……I like you……」

My body reacted surprisingly upon being called out.

「I like you. I like you, Young Master…I love you……」

It was a very loving confession.

I suddenly felt the feeling of ejaculation, and my mind felt like it was going to blank out. I pulled her with all my strength, and the only thought that remained in my mind was to paint her deepest area with my semen.

「Minith! I’m cumming!」

Unconsciously, I was letting out a very loud cry as I reached my orgasm.

My mind felt like I vividly saw the scene when my semen was released and filled the inside of her pussy.

Chapter 14: Ate the Maid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


「I like you… Wilk-sama.」

「I also like you.」

Minith kissed my cheek. As a response, I gave her a kiss on the forehead. She was acting like a spoiled child on my chest while laughing, so I embraced her.

After ejaculating inside her vagina, both of us collapsed on the bed and was enjoying our lovey-dovey time. We took off both our clothes and hugged each other completely naked.

Minith was concerned at first because her position was a servant, but when I told her how she just confessed her love a while ago, she eventually responded to my teasing while blushing. After she accepted it, she was so enthusiastic at showing her love.

Additionally, I’d forbidden her from calling me young master and asked her to call me by name. The promise was that it was only when in the bed. Perhaps Minith was pleased that she made a promise between us, she was in a very good mood.

As for me, I was also very satisfied with experiencing my first intimate sex.

「Wilk-sama is always kind. I… I’ve loved you for a long time now.」

「Long time?」

I’d whispered her nothing but honeyed words in order to make her fall in love, but I normally wouldn’t say such things that would set one’s teeth on edge. 

Rather, I was the kind of person who’s considerate towards the servants. Several years after I reincarnated into this world, I still hadn’t gotten used to the life as the eldest son of a Marquis, so I felt bad towards the servant’s display of excessive respect. 

Maybe because I still felt the same as that time, I would often leave the room and wait when the maids were cleaning, like a typical Sunday dad. The same thing happened this time. As their master, there wasn’t really any need to be considerate towards their work.

「Yes… Wilk-sama pays attention even to a low class servant like me.」

My father, for example, had the kind of character that views lower class servants as tools. It was so obvious from his attitude that he didn’t care the slightest bit about them. He’d only start recognizing them once they sit in positions such as Buttler and head maid. That wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rather than being remembered by the head of a Marquis, the servants would feel more at ease when they were viewed as tools.

「Is that so?」

I felt like it was more accurate to use the word considerate rather than saying that I was paying them attention, but I wouldn’t say that, so I wasn’t sure what to reply. However, Minith continued on her words.

「I was really, very happy.」

From her loving expression, Minith’s face reddened and tears were coming from her eyes. She talked about the matter that happened several years ago while crying.

Minith was a famous beauty in the town. Her family’s garden center had been delivering products such as flowers and plants to the castle, so her parents suggested if she wanted to work as a servant in the castle. At that time, Minith had confidence. She went to the castle’s gate and succeeded in being employed without any problems.

Non-exclusive lower-class maid. That was the first position given to her. Before long, she was called out by the head maid and received her scolding because her speech was bad, her actions didn’t have grace, she was clumsy, and so on. Every time she was scolded, Minith did her best to work on her bad points. However, there was a single problem—clothing.

At that time, the Quordentz house still hadn’t implemented the uniforms. The clothes they need to buy and wear to avoid the maid heads scoldings were the expensive kind. Obviously, she couldn’t just wear the same clothing every day, so she needed to buy several of these expensive clothes. If she did that, It would slightly exceed the budget for her clothing expenses included in her salary.

It would be good if the problem ended there. But if you were to wear the cheapest kind of acceptable clothing, the senior servants would sneer and talk behind your back.  There was apparently a trend among the servants. If you just bought and wore expensive clothing but didn’t follow that trend, they’d treat you as a joke behind you back. And, Minith didn’t have the sense to read those trends.

「When I was crying, the person who extended me his hand was Wilk-sama.」

……Did I do such thing?

「Wilk-sama was the one who came to us servants and suggested the uniforms right now. I never imagined that the Marquis’ son would think about us.」

That reminds me, I think I wandered around the castle at the time when I was thinking about making the uniforms and took a survey about it. So Minith was among them. 

For the time being, I’d pretend that I remember it.

「We no longer have to worry about our clothes. I’ve always wanted to thank you. All of us lower-class servants were saved by Wilk-sama.」

After that,  Minith who had worked hard on her work obtained the opportunity to become a personal maid of Fanny or me. In order to thank me, Minith apparently chose to become my personal maid.

「Today, when Wilk-sama showed me the new uniform, I remembered about that time and felt nostalgic.」

Apparently, she was very happy to try out the uniform. This time, I pressed on her while praising her work. I see, no wonder I was able to get her so easy. I was lucky.

「It felt like a dream to be able wear a beautiful dress like this and, um, and to sleep with Wilk-sama.」

As if remembering about our passionate acts, she averted her gaze embarassingly. Her behavior was very attractive, so I kissed her cheeks one more time. 

…..

….

…

When I came to myself, the light coming from the window had changed to an orange color. Looks like we’d fallen asleep after that. The night seemed to be approaching as I absentmindedly watched the window. The orange color disappeared shortly while being replaced by the darkness of the night.

「Minith. It’s already afternoon—no, evening.」

When I shook her body, Minith faintly opened her eyes. While waking her up, I also grabbed her breasts. I might be a man who really loved breasts. 

「Eh…? Evening?」

Minith paled, and she turned towards the window. Perhaps she was thinking that she’d get punished for skipping her work midway and having sex. But, there wouldn’t be any problem. I could just explain it to the head maid. As long as I say that its fine, everything would be settled.

「Are you worried about your work? Don’t worry I’ll talk to the head maid.」

「I, think……」

「What’s the matter? Ah, from the feeling of my stomach, it should be time for dinner. If possible I’d like to enter the bath before taking dinner.」

While I was nonchalantly thinking about the bath, I was forgeting about an important matter.

「Wilk-sama? Won’t Fanny-sama visit in this room?」

The room was enveloped with an indescribable scent of a man and woman. The bed was disordered, and fluids could be seen here and there. It would be dinner soon.

「Oh my goodness…」

I rang the bell on the bedside to call Tesh.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 15: The Castle at Night
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


「Big Brother, when will Grandfather come back? 」

「His letter has reached here the week before the last.」

After dinner, Fanny visited my room just as scheduled. When she entered my room, she was surprised by the intense smell of flowers, but her joyful figure as she said 「there are so many flowers in here. It’s beautiful! 」 looked very cute.

She had no idea that they were there to remove the after-sex smell. Tesh told me that he asked the gardener for a couple of flowers from the flower bed. I only felt thankful that he’d properly handled the room while I was taking my dinner.

「I wonder where Grandfather is right now.」

 Fanny said while looking at the region map that was spread on top of the table.

「Hmm, this time Grandfather advanced all the way to this area, so on his way back, he might be around here. According to his letter, they’ve completed the operation without any problem. So I think he’ll return through the shortest route. Who knows, perhaps he’s already at the entrance of Nyuneri City.」

I thought while sliding my finger on the map.

Grandfather was my father’s father and the previous head of the house. At present, he’d already handed over the headship, but he hadn’t retired yet and was engaging war with other lands. 

I somehow had the unified image of a country from my previous world, but that wasn’t really the case in this world.  

The lords of each territory were governing their own lands as they like, and the strongest among them was the king. That’s why most nobles didn’t have any loyalty towards the royal family. There were even some nobles who were trying to outsmart the royal family so that they could stand at the top. 

If the royal family weakened, the nobles would usually abandon their king and join other countries or start their own together with the other nobles that they have good relations. 

Since the royal family didn’t have a strong authority towards the lords, it was often the case that some nobles would engage in war with the nobles from other countries. 

The closest example would be us, Quordentz. The Quordentz house had been frequently in a war with Jinkaen Empire, an empire located next to Levios Kingdom. Of course, we weren’t engaging in war with the whole empire, but only with some of the nobles under it. 

Both the Levios Kingdom and the Jinkaen Empire were nothing more than a group of gathered lords. Levious Kingdom was founded around 80 years ago, while Jinkaen Empire only had  55 years of history. 

My grandfather, who really hated some of the nobles in the empire, turned over the headship to my father the moment my father became an adult and moved the army that he’d personally trained to provoke a war.

According to the records in the warehouse, our territory had been expanding to the west, taking over the lands from the nobles of the empire. The reason the slavery had been in good shape these past years was also due to Grandfather’s actions.

From the perspective of the Levios royal family, they were satisfied and didn’t have any issue that my grandfather was stomping the enemy empire. Even during the recent campaign, Grandfather fiercely rampaged around the empire’s lands.

「Someday, I want to see the world like Grandfather.」

The world that Grandfather was seeing, I think it was a world filled with blood. If Fanny were to see that kind of world, she’d probably die from shock.

「If you want to go outside, then lets go to the town together in the future.」

「Wow! are we really going?」

「Yes, I also have some business to do in the town so you can come along. I’ll talk to father about it.」

Fanny leaned her head on my arms. I patted her head which felt like a silk while saying ‘there, there’.  Fanny was forbidden to leave the castle, so for her, going to the castle town was a big event. In order to realize my date with my younger sister, I had to do my best to persuade father.

A knocking sound was coming from the door. From the way it was knocked, I guessed that it was Tesh, so I permitted the entrance.

「Young Master, Young Miss, I’m sorry for bothering this late at night.」

I was just about to finish our study and go to sleep. Tesh seldom visited my room at this hour. Only around the center of the room had light, so I activated magic to open a light around the door.

「What’s the matter? Since you’re coming at this hour, there must be some important matter.」

「Yes. Old master has just returned from his campaign. He said he has something urgent to talk about with Young Master.」

The old master that Tesh mentioned was my grandfather.

「So Grandfather has returned. Did, did he mention anything about me?」

「No, he only said that he has something to talk about with Young Master.」

「I see…」

Softly embracing Fanny who was feeling dejected, I gently caressed her head.

「Fanny, Grandfather is calling at this hour.  Something important must’ve happened. I’m sure Grandfather will see you tomorrow.」

「Young Master, I’m very sorry but may I lead the way?」

It seemed like it was really an urgent matter. It was a pity that I couldn’t touch fanny’s soft body, but I had to meet my grandfather first. 

Led by Tesh, I stepped into the conference room. Sitting in there was my father, Grandfather, and his subordinate knights. I greeted my father who was the head of the Quordentz house first, then my grandfather, the previous head.

「Its been a while, Wilk.」

「I’ve very glad to see that you’re fine, Grandfather. Its been a long time.」

The bearded dandy with a healthy complexion was my grandfather. In this world, people with large magic power were apparently more immune to aging.  Although that also had something to do with their constitution. Its just that, no matter how strong a person’s magic power, they would reach the limit of their lifespan at around 100 years old.

The knights under my grandfather all greeted. Nobles were very conscious to the differences in status. Immediately after the greetings, I decided to hear out the reason my grandfather called me here.

「Grandfather, did anything happen?」

「I think that the next campaign is perfect for you. Didn’t you say that you wanted to stand on the front?」

That reminds me, I think I did say something along the lines that I wanted to try out my new attack magic and have my first experience on the battlefield, and then get my hands on some women from the captured towns and villages.

Honestly, I’d already tested that new magic and I’d also obtained a woman, so I didn’t feel like going. Grandfather had just returned, and he was already preparing to attack again. What’s the problem with this person?

「It’s just the right place to decorate your first campaign. The area around is our territory, and the magic user’s from the enemy are no big deal. The only troubling point is their numbers.  I wanted to avoid assigning you to a dangerous place, but it wouldn’t be good if you become an adult without standing at least once in the battlefield.」

Grandfather calmly explained his point, and then he added:

「If you miss this chance, you might have to go as far as inside the Jinkaen Empire’s lands in the next battle. In that case, you’ll have to consider their magic users. It’s not very suitable for your first battle.」

Putting together my grandfather’s explanation, I understood that it would be easier if I experienced my first battle at the upcoming campaign. Since I wouldn’t be able to avoid it, joining the easier one was better.

「I understand. Grandfather, I’d like to join the operation to capture the city and have my first campaign.」

I declared as clearly and coolly as possible. Grandfather and father glanced at each other, and their expression became serious.

「Very well. Wilk, I’ll entrust you with 5000 soldiers.」

「Yes, sir!」

I took a serious posture. I’d suddenly been given 5000 troops. A Marquis sure was very impressive.

「There’s no need to be so tense. I’ll arrange a veteran who knows how to lead an army as your adjutant. You can ask for his opinion as a reference. You don’t need to do anything reckless.」

Grandfather patted my shoulder, and I noticed that I was feeling nervous. After all, I’d be leading 5000 soldiers. It was reassuring that my veteran Grandfather gave me an assistant that he approved.

Grandfather swept the room with his eyes before speaking in a serious tone.

「Operation Goal: The Capture of Nambonan City. You’re to depart immediately at dawn.」

Oh! 

A loud shout echoed inside the room. The departure would be tomorrow. I had my armor, but I hadn’t done any other preparations. Instead, I really want to make love with Eve or Minith. Going to a battlefield while surrounded by men, give me a break.

Afterward, Tesh rigorously performed the preparations for my departure to the front and finished it before dawn. While he was preparing, I was able to get the gist of the operation this time.

The number of soldiers participating from Quordentz house in this campaign was approximately 60,000. The enemy side was estimated around 120,000.

The attacking side was half the number of the defensive side. 

Was this really suited for my first campaign?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 16: Fall of Nambonan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Today was the second day since Nambonan surrendered. Ten days had passed since I departed from Nyuneri Castle. In short, it was now the tenth day since I last had sex.

I was aimlessly walking through the streets of Nambonan City, which was already under our control. Although things looked calmer compared the day we’d battled, a tense atmosphere could be sensed from within the city.

「Still, the city is quieter than I imagined.  I had the impression that they’d resisted until the end.」

「The lord of this city—I mean, the council was it? The representative of the city has requested their surrender, and they are currently preparing the place for discussions. The citizens probably can’t do anything about it. Furthermore, the city guards are actively hunting the resistance.」

Looking at the citizens of Nambonan walking down the road, they appeared very vigilant towards the people who looked like guards. They most likely couldn’t feel at ease since the city guards who lived and kept the order of this city were now keeping an eye on them.

「If the people were to rise in revolt now, Nambonan would be in a disadvantage during the negotiations. That’s why for the people governing the city, they are desperately stopping any sign of uprising.」

「Even though we’ve already controlled the city, they’re still thinking about fair negotiation, as expected from the city of merchants.」

Commercial City, Nambonan.

Located nearby a river, Nambonan was formerly one of the cities under Jinkaen Empire. The disturbance caused by the succession to the throne that started with the death of the second emperor greatly changed the empire’s map. Nambonan, a very common city located inside of the Empire, had changed into a border city in a single night. And of all places, the border city was located between the Levios Kingdom and Jinkaen Empire.

At that time, the noble from the empire in charge of governing Nambonan had a cowardly character, and he judged that there was no way to protect this land. He quickly pulled his soldiers and went to defend a different city far away from the border. However, the citizens had nowhere to go. While praying to the great spirit of the sun so that they could avoid being engulfed by the flames of war, the people decided to govern the city on their own without relying on the nobles to protect their homeland.

In the end, Nambonan was able to avoid being pulled into the war. Instead, they’d become valued by the peddlers as their stopover because the city had a better public order than the other borders. The city that had lost its vested rights along with the governance of a noble was a dream city for the merchants. 

Influential merchants were elected to the council that was established as the government system and developed the place as a commercial city which no one had seen before. Self-government had been developing in Nambonan.

Noticing that Nambonan had turned into a pot of gold, the former ruler tried to return as its lord but was repelled by Nambonan’s army. Nambonan was no longer a border city of the empire, it had obtained its own independence and could already be called a city-state.

Nambonan evolved from a common city to a border city, and then to a commercial city. The time it took for that transformation was only 20 years. That was Nambonan’s turbulent history.

「Oh, isn’t it Wilk-dono.」

While I was talking with my guard, a person called from behind. The person standing there was a toad man… no, it was a middle-aged man wearing a strange smile with his toad-like face and very fat body. It was Viscount Galliana. He sure looked like a villain.

「Oh, so its Viscount Galliana. To be in a place like this, do you have any business here?」

The city was under the control of the allied army, but there was no guarantee that there wouldn’t be any guerilla. Even if the soldiers from our army were standing ready in the important locations in the city, it was still weird for a Viscount and the current head of Galliana to walk around casually.

「I’m here for the same reason as Wilk-dono. 」

Viscount Galliana’s face as he displayed a smile looked so evil that it made me wonder whether he was really an ally. Well, if he really had the same objective as me, it was no wonder that he was showing an evil smile. 

As for why I went as far as to go inside this city even though it was in disorder, it was to have a sex. Perhaps my grandfather noticed that I’d been restraining myself since the campaign, he suddenly went to my camp this morning and told me to sleep with a woman. As expected of my grandfather, he was understanding. And so, I entered the city immediately after finishing my breakfast.

「Still, as one would expect from the eldest son of a Marquis, only taking several bodyguards with him. I’ve also heard about your action on the battlefield, that you were like a demon.」

There were five guards surrounding me and probably several more in the shadows, but it still wasn’t much. Looking at Viscount Galliana’s surrounding, there were around thirty bodyguards. When I activated detection magic, I sensed that there were many experts among them.

「I know that there’s no one possessing a large magic power in the city through the wide area detection magic. I originally planned to walk by myself, but my grandfather assigned the bodyguards.」

The enemy’s magic users weren’t a big deal. If there were powerful ones, it would be the nobles in the Quordentz’s allied army.

I could tell that my bodyguards had become very alert. Viscount Galliana possessed enough magic power to attack me. They were wary of an assassin who might’ve slipped inside while the city hadn’t regained its peace yet.

「I was a member of Nambonan’s council for several years. This place is like my own garden. I just felt like I wanted to look around inside since it’s been a while.」

He narrowed his eyes and looked nostalgically afar. He was originally a common merchant before rising to become a viscount. Still, it was my first time hearing that he was a council member.

「Depending on what it is you’re trying to find, I might be able to provide some assistance.」

Even though I didn’t ask him, Viscount Galliana began to talk about the information on the city. He talked about the places such as the upper-class district with many sheltered young ladies, the commoner’s district, and the red light district. Since I wasn’t familiar with Nambonan’s geography, the information was useful for me.

「Where does Viscount Galliana plan to go?」

「The business district. The person who’d troubled me back during my merchant days should still be in there. I’ll go and have his wife and daughter in front—ooops…」

Giving an intentional cough, he stopped on his words. He really was suited to be a villain.

Since I was worried about whether I’d be able to get to the other districts myself, I went along with Viscount Galliana up to the business district.

「Oh, its open.」

There was a shop running despite the city being under our control. Based on the signboard, it must be a bar. There weren’t any rules about underaged being unable to drink in this world, but I somehow felt that it would affect my growth, so I made sure to avoid drinking as much as possible. I’d drink during social parties, but I would drink alone only once I’ve reach above 20 years of age.

Maybe because of the dry air, I felt slightly thirsty, so I went inside the store. I hope there was a non-alcoholic drink.

「Welcome!」

「Give us any drink as long as its not alcohol.」

My bodguards were letting out a slightly dissatisfied voice because they couldn’t drink alcohol. Aren’t you guys still guarding me? You can’t drink.

Six mugs were placed on top of a nearby table. They were probably telling us to sit there, so we followed.

「Young Master, there is no problem with the drinks.」

The bodyguards assigned to guard me were all magic users, and some could use a poison detection magic. Just in case, I also activated detection magic and then confirmed that the drink was safe.

「Is this a tea?」

There was steam coming out from the warm tea inside the wooden mug. It smelled slightly like a jasmine tea.

「Its a tea made of leaves found in a nearby place, customer.」　

「Hm? I see. It smells nice.」

「Since you don’t know this, then you must be a mercenary? It was tough for you guys, wasn’t it? At times like this, its best to drink tea and forget about it. The tea is also delicious during normal times, though.」

Immediately after saying that, the waitress went to bring alcohol to another table. It seemed like they didn’t know we were from the army occupying the city. Perhaps they’d mistaken us as mercenaries since I left the mantle with my family’s crest and my guards were wearing brown mantle to avoid standing out.

In the first place, the ordinary soldiers weren’t allowed to go outside the camp which was set up the important locations inside the city. As long as the people didn’t intentionally go to see them, they wouldn’t come in contact with the Quordentz’s army.

While drinking the tea to moisten my throat, I observed the atmosphere in the bar. The bar which looked as big as a school’s gymnasium had a gloomy atmosphere.

「We could’ve continued fighting! Why did the council surrender!」

「In the first place, It was wrong to meet them in the field! Why didn’t we hide in the city?!」

「Holing up inside the city even though we don’t have any reinforcement, what are you expecting!? Are you going to wait until you starve to death?」

「It’s unforgivable that they quickly abandoned the defense line after using the high taxes we paid to establish it. For what purpose did they even establish it?!」

「To begin with, It was a mistake to go against the Quordentz.」

「Those damned rebels from the Quordentz!」

「Engaging the allied army of nobles in the field was in itself a suicide act!」

「It’s the foolish council’s fault for being unable to protect Nambonan’s independence! I won’t forgive them!」

「Don’t worry Viscount Galliana is among the nobles in the army occupying the city. He’ll definitely protect us.」

「There’s no way we can win siege warfare!」

「Those greedy bastards from the Quordentz! Who do they think there are!」

「This city was done for the moment the surrounding territories became a territory of the Quordentz!」

「Damned those mercenaries for running right away! You guys were hired using our tax, so you should’ve fought till death!」

「What did you say?! You lied to us and told that we’d fight against the current head of the Quordent, but the one in there was the red demon, you’re dirty! A merchants city that couldn’t even protect its agreement, its only natural that you’d lose!」

「Nambonan’s star, Viscount Galliana was there?! I’m glad! Nambonan will be saved!」

「We’re done for! It’s all over! Our beloved Nambonan is done for!」

There seemed to be a great number of mercenaries and citizens who loved this city. 

Once in a while, there would be people who were calling to fight until the bitter end, and they’d get taken by the city guards. It was an interesting sight. This bar might be a place used to gather and capture these disturbing elements within the city.

Viscount Galliana who was being treated as a savior should be attacking his formal rival’s shop right about this time. 

There were people fighting here and there. Some drank too much and were vomiting. Some others were laughing while smiling. It was that kind of a strange scene.

「Nambonan’s people sure love their city.」

「You understand?」

I was only talking to myself, but the beautiful waitress picked up my words.

「Nambonan became a border city when I was only six years old. It all started at that time. We abandoned the nobles who ran on their own. Its a city that the people have started.」

The history of Nambonan that she described was mostly the same as the one I’d read in the warehouse. However, the chaos during the time the city had changed into a border city and the hardships they experienced were quite interesting. These events weren’t in the record and could only be known by the people on the scene at that time.

The abandoned people and the abandoned city. It was a story about how these abandoned people established their own government and developed it to become the merchant city of today. 

When I noticed it, the bar had become silent, and everyone was listening to her Nambonan’s Story of Success. 

Perhaps feeling emotional, A man who appeared to be a citizen was bowing on the table while crying without caring about the surrounding’s looks.

「I feel it because I’ve been serving in this shop for a long time. This district’s liveliness wouldn’t lose to the imperial capital. We can live without needing to be servile to a noble. It’s the best district.」

The men listening around would sometimes shout-out their support. Apparently, she’s been this bar’s idol since she was six years old. She seemed greatly cared for by the people and merchants who were present during those troubled times. 

Considering Nambonan’s history, the reason they treat her as an idol despite being 26 years old now was most likely due to that. This bar was supposedly the biggest bar in this district,  so there should be many people who had seen her mature. On top of that, she was beautiful.

「The place has gotten gloomy, so let’s not talk about this! We must not feel dispirited because our fight has just begun! Nambonan definitely won’t lose against those Quordentz!」

As if wiping the tears that gathered at the corner of her eyes, she gripped her fist and smiled towards everyone in the store.

「Right! We will never lose!」

「Anna-chan, we’ll protect you!」

「Your the symbol of Nambonan! Make sure not to lose!」

「We won’t let that Quordentz army touch Anna-chan! Don’t worry!」

「Well said! She’s our pride!」

The bar instantly became cheerful, and the bright atmosphere filled the place at once.

「You’re embarrassing me!  But, do you understand Nambonan now? Hey, where did you come from?  You came here to join the war, right?  Let me hear about you guys. I like listening to stories about other towns.」

She turned around here shyly and spoke as if to hide it. I felt like my inner sadistic self was breaking out, or rather, my lust was starting to rise. I’d restrained myself for ten days.

「Yes, we came to participate in the war.」

「Just as I thought. So you’re a mercenary? Seeing that the youngest one looks like the leader, are you perhaps a warrior with magic power?」

I knew that the others were listening to our conversation. I smiled broadly and denied.

「You’re not a mercenary? Didn’t you come here to participate in the war?」

I stood up. Everyone was paying attention to me.

「I did come to participate in the war. It’s just that, you’re wrong about my opponent.」

I looked at everyone in the store. 

The city guards were observing us closely. 

Loud and clearly, I slowly said:

「I came here to trample on Nambonan.」

Chapter 17: Deliciously Eating the Bar Waitress (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The store immediately fell into a commotion. A city guard approached and tried to grab my arm to suppress the uproar.

「Keep your hands, you lowly servant!」

My guard grabbed the hand of the city guard. Then, another one my guards showed a paper. Upon seeing that, the city guard prostrated while looking ghastly pale.

That paper was something written by my grandfather, and it had the seal of Nambonan’s Council. It was like an extraterritorial certificate that would enable a person to do whatever they want, whether killing or raping someone, without being questioned.

「Young Master, what do you intend to do?」

I ignored his question. I originally planned to barge in every house to find a beautiful girl, but since there was one that fell into my feet without needing to do all those things, I’ll gladly receive it.

「Your statements up until now can be recognized as a treason.」

「Eh…? You are…?」

Anna, the waitress in front of me, appeared to be confused at my sudden words. Feeling afraid, Anna took a step back, allowing me to see her whole figure. 

Just as I figured, she was in her mid-20s. Her hair light orange and eyes close to gray. The sex appeal coming from her fully riped body was very captivating. Maybe it was because I died at around 30 years old in my previous world, I found woman of her age arousing. From her dress which looked like something Germans would wear during Oktoberfest, the fragrance of a simple village girl drifted, and it stimulated my nether regions.

「Girl, correct your rude behavior!」

Before anyone noticed, my guard drew his sword and pointed it towards Anna. The atmosphere in the store instantly became alert.

「Do you mind sleeping with me? If you agree now, I’ll be gentle.」

「Eh? But, I don’t want?」

In that case, I’d have to be forceful. I slowly looked around the store, and then released my magic power to intimidate them. Its effect was enough to silence the crowd. Confirming the silence, I said in a loud voice:

「There seem to be some people trying to rebel in here. I can’t just let that pass.」

Quickly grasping Anna’s arm, I turned her around and held her from behind. I slid my hand on her chest and tightly grabbed her breast.

「Ah! It hurts!」

The customers were letting out angry voices upon hearing her pained cry. I continued rubbing her breast while lightly tightening her neck as she resisted. 

「Sto—！Stop it! It’s, painful!」

The city guards went out in front to control the customers who were about to pounce on me. Seeing the city guards block them, the citizens began to protest furiously. A girl who greatly loved Nambonan was about to get raped, but the city guards who were supposed to be Nambonan’s citizen were protecting them. The crowd rained abuses towards the city guards.

「Kukuku, what’s the matter? Didn’t you say that Nambonan wouldn’t lose to Quordentz?」

Being in the spotlight made me want to act my best as a villain. Sounding as evil as possible, I whispered it in Anna’s ears. I stretched out my tongue and licked Anna from her chin towards her cheek. It was a very pleasant feeling.

「Quordentz?!」

Shocked, Anna blurted. Her surprise immediately spread to the whole store.

The city guard who immediately prostrated upon seeing a paper, a young man behaving like a big-shot and his guards, a tremendous amount of magic power that even simple release without any killing intent was so intimidating, and then the word that Anna shouted.

The air could be felt trembling. I took off my helmet and placed it on a nearby table.

Originally hidden under the helmet, the sky blue hair which I inherited from my mother stood up. The color was in contrast with my father and grandfather’s fire-like red hair.

「How dare you curse my Quordentz family. I hope you’re all prepared.」

Blue Demon…Someone muttered.

I ordered one of my guards to bar the only exit of the store. Seeing that there was no way to escape, the customers stuck to the wall and desperately began to distance themselves from me.

Shortly after, I was in the center while hugging Anna. Showing it off to them, I rubbed Anna’s soft breasts.

「Oh, this is strange. You people were just ridiculing the Quordentz a while ago, but now everyone’s so quiet? And here I thought I’d be able to see the brave figure of Nambonan’s citizens.」

While I was pretending to laugh, I heard a scream from the corner of the store. When I moved my gaze there, my guards were beheading several of the citizens. Scattered blood dyed the walls red.

「Young Master. These are the people who mocked master and the Quordentz. I dealt with them at my discretion.」

A head was kicked like a soccer ball and rolled towards another person. The customers began to desparately explain upon seeing the scene.

I only complained about the Council I didn’t complain about the Quordentz. I mocked the city guards and not the Quordentz. I only made fun of the mercenaries and not the Quordentz.

They began to prostrate as if they were completely sober now.

Perhaps he’d been observing the people insulting us, one of my guards was beheading some citizens without paying the surroundings any heed. It looked like he’d been very irritated.

「Hpmh, these people look like they are holding the intention to rebel. No, maybe its the fault of the owner and his employees for letting these people act as they please. This is troublesome. We should just behead everyone. What do you say?」

This time, I loudly asked Anna. Shaking off the regretful feeling of being unable to grab her breasts, I released her. The shop owner, the customers, and the employees were all paying attention to her.

Then, Anna went down on her knees and lowered her head.

「I, I’m sorry for being unable to recognize that you’re a personage from the Quordentz! Even though it was a jest they made due to being drunk, I’m very sorry for making you feel uncomfortable! Please, please show mercy!」

She was almost prostrating herself. If it was a Japanese person, they’d be in that pose before placing their forehead on the ground. But in this world, that posture was used to express their deepest apology. And if the one who performed that was a woman, their chest part would stand out, and their two mounds would become clearly visible. Her breasts were in full view. Wonderful. I’d salivate just imagining the deliciousness of those swaying fruits.

「I didn’t know since I was only drinking a tea, but alcohol may indeed cause people to say things that they don’t mean.」

I blamed the alcohol and suggested the idea to forgive them.

「That, that’s right!」

Glancing at my guard, he was wiping the blood from his sword. It seemed like he’d finished disposing of the people who’d insulted us. There were around seven heads rolling on the ground. It was impressive how he was so observant.

「You’re done?」

「I’ve disposed of the ones that I remembered… Does Young Master remember anyone else?」

This guy could read what I was trying to do.

「Let me see. I remember some of them. But just as this woman said, they might’ve said it because they were drunk. If that is the case, I don’t mind forgiving them. 」

I didn’t really remember anyone, or rather, I couldn’t be bothered to remember them.

We’re saved!The atmosphere within the store relaxed, but I had no intention of ending things here.

I looked at Anna who was making the same relieved expression.

「I’m still considering whether to accept your appeal.」

Anna’s body trembled. I continued my words in a lowered voice.

「Now, what should I do…」

When I said that, Anna shut her eyes tightly. I watched her silently until she finished thinking. I’d been obviously touching her body and looking at her breasts, so she was most likely able to guess something.

She’ll be able to protect the shop owner, her co-workers, and the regular customers. However, she’d have to sleep with me for that to happen. Maybe she’d realized the meaning of my words she opened her eyes, and resignation could be seen from it.

「There… There’s a room over there, so could I have a word with you…? I’m sure you’ll be convinced.」

While being led by Anna, I entered the room inside the counter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 18: Deliciously Eating the Bar Waitress (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translator Note: the term “shogun” and “general’ will be used here, but their meaning is the same.

The room was like a resting room for employees or a changing room, but it would turn into a lovemaking room now.

「Umm… You’re name? Quordentz’s Shogun-sama?」

That reminds me, I did mention that I was a member of Quordentz house, but I didn’t tell her my name. There wouldn’t be any issue in the noble society even if my name were to spread as a noble who rapes commoners. But personally, that wouldn’t be so pleasant.

Anna was the only one who could hear it here, so it wouldn’t spread by much even if I tell her my name.  Thinking of my previous world, being called Shogun-sama made me have the image of the downfall of the Quordentz.

「My name is Wilk. If I say I’m the grandson of General Garphis, will you recognize me?」

My grandfather’s name was Garphis, and he was the supreme commander for this Nambonan campaign. Father didn’t go out and stayed in the castle.

「I knew it, you’re General Garphis’…!」

「If you think I’m lying, I can take you to the camp in the army later. I don’t know what will happen to you afterward, though.」

Anna shook her head to the sides to refuse.

I decided to start making my move. I wanted to cum so badly. If she accepted the first time I asked her, I would’ve treated her gently, but she rejected it so I’d do it my way.

I stripped off the clothes on her chest and exposed her breasts. Her slightly dark nipples became exposed, and I sucked it. I teased it with my lips, and then violently rubbed her breasts. Unlike a young girl, it was overflowing with the flavor of a mature woman, and I felt like I could taste it inside my mouth.

「Ahhh….Guuu…」

I thought she would start crying, but she only distorted her face as if disgusted. She didn’t cry and shout like a virgin, and it seemed like she’d accepted this unfortunate happening as something she couldn’t escape from. Since we were going to do it, I would have her become pregnant.

「Turn your ass here! You can use the table there.」

「……Yes.」

She didn’t resist at all. Although Eve had resisted and it was quite troublesome, it was kind of fun. But, that didn’t mean that Anna was dull for not resisting at all. I was feeling very good.

She knew that she was completely powerless to resist, so she surrendered her own body. What a very wonderful thing. Her miserable figure as she looked disgusted spurred my sadism. 

Anna placed her upper body on the table and turned her ass towards here. Her skirt had different colors of fabrics here and there, proof that she’d fixed it several times. It looked as if it was showing the kind of life she’d been living up until now, and it made me aroused. When she was fixing this skirt, she probably never imagined she’d suffer like this.

「Mmuu!」

I rolled her skirt up and pulled down her panty, and then exposed her vagina which was covered in pubic hair. This was a little unexpected. When I avoided her pubic hair and tried to confirm it, her pussy had a more loose shape than Eve and Minith. Furthermore, it had a thicker smell. I felt dizzy, but that too felt very pleasant. As proof, my dick was standing hard while twitching, ready to release its load.

Lightly touching the lips of her vagina, It wasn’t wet. Well, it was fine. I couldn’t hold it anymore. I intended to have sex with a woman today, so I wore an easy to take off pants. I removed the button on my pants and easily took out my dick.

「I’m putting in it.」

She didn’t respond. The room was bright, so I easily knew where to insert it. I didn’t really need to tell her that I would start putting it. Thinking of that, I pushed my dick that was waiting outside her hole and advanced deeper inside.

「It—! It hurt—! kuu!」

As expected, inserting it inside her without any foreplay appeared to be painful. Anna’s body bent, and she was letting out an anguished cry. As for me, I was enjoying the warm embrace of her vagina.

This situation where I was having sex with someone I’d just met was very irresistible. She was just a lively and cheerful woman a while ago, but now she was shaking from the pain with her ass towards me. This gap tugged at my heartstrings.

「Oh, its all inside you. This feeling is great.」

I spanked her ass once, and the cry that she let out was amusing.

「I’ll start moving.」

I’d only experienced sex twice, each with Eve and Minith. I remembered that I hadn’t really been able to thrust my hips during both times. There were times when I’d ejaculated prematurely, and swinging my hips was difficult.

In an erotic manga, the virgin guy would be thrusting his hips like there was no tomorrow, but I didn’t think that was possible without any practice. And so, I’d decided to practice with Anna.

「nnmn…! nnmn…! nnmn…! 」

I pulled my dick and thrust it.

I pulled my dick and thrust it.

I repeated these actions.

I thrust slowly at first before eventually picking up the speed as I got used to it. One time, I’d pulled it way too much, and it slipped off her vagina, but I didn’t mind and thrust again. The feeling coming from my dick as it entered and exited her vagina was pleasant, and I was somehow also feeling pleasure from my feet which was getting exhausted.

Then, I felt I’d reached my limit, and released my ten days worth of semen deep inside her.

「I’m cumming! Take it all inside!」

「Guu……!」

I felt like I heard the sound of my ejaculation in my mind. My ten days worth of semen was released and sought her body. I leaned on Anna’s back while saliva was dripping from my mouth. Even without looking at a mirror, I knew that my face was distorted in pleasure.

「Take my sperm and get pregnant!」

While letting out my semen, I wasn’t sure anymore whether I was talking to Anna or blurting out whatever was on my mind. However, I somehow felt aroused hearing my own line, causing me to release more. I was quite embarrassed to feel aroused from hearing my own words.

「Ahh… Its coming in…」

I couldn’t hear her voice clearly because I was pressing her face on the table. My first ejaculation released its final drop of semen and ended along with her voice. 

Placing my face on her back,  I enjoyed the lingering feeling after ejaculating. 

「Haa, haa, haa.」

I was the only one breathing heavily. Anna had only been maintaining her position, without looking aroused at all. She breathed as she continuously endured the pain with her teeth gritted.

「Fuu, what a nice body.」

I pulled my dick which had gotten softer and was covered in semen and then moved it in front of Anna. Startled, Anna looked like she didn’t understand my intention.

「I’m telling you to clean it! Didn’t it get dirty because of your body?」

I was acting very selfish, but she wasn’t allowed to resist it.

Misunderstanding my intention, she took a cloth nearby and tried to wipe my dick. I immediately moved my hips to avoid it.

「What are you doing? Don’t you know the proper way to clean it?」

I wanted her to clean it using her mouth, but she didn’t get my intention. Moreover, She didn’t show any refusal. I felt irritated since she really looked like she didn’t know how to do it. In the end, she even apologized for her ignorance. 

It was somehow embarrassing to say it on my own, but it couldn’t be helped, so I prepared myself.

「I’m telling you to suck it clean.」

Anna’s expression twisted so much that it looked amusing. She didn’t like to clean it with her mouth, but I didn’t have any intention of allowing her to refuse. While I was watching her silently, she held the base of my dick which had gotten sticky from the fluids and stuck out her tongue as if she’d resolved herself.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 19: Deliciously Eating the Bar Waitress (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Anna stuck out her tongue and lightly poked my balls. After I finished ejaculating, my dick had become smaller. 

「Don’t poke it like that! Lick it!」

Incidentally, a foreskin normally closed the head of my dick. It becomes half peeled when erect, and then fully uncovered when I pull it down slightly. Several years ago, I couldn’t pull the skin down even when erect. Considering that, it would probably be able to pulled down on its own without using my hands after growing in a few more years. 

My dick which was in front of Anna was currently covered in foreskin. After it lost its erection after ejaculating, the foreskin returned.

「Put it inside your mouth and lick the semen off. Don’t spit anything out. Taste it fully before swallowing it.」

When I gave her my orders, she wordlessly followed it. She had easily taken my dick, which had become smaller, inside her mouth. Then, she obediently moved as I ordered, and then licked the remaining semen off before swallowing it.  The way her throat moved as she swallowed it was erotic.

「Pull back the skin and clean the inside, without using your hands.」

I could sense that she was only touching the foreskin, so I gave her a new instruction. She moved her tongue and tried out different ways to clean the inside. I could feel the tip of her tongue brushing the head of my dick. I sensed that she was somehow working to put her tongue inside the foreskin. 

It was a ticklish and pleasant feeling.

Realizing she wouldn’t be able to clean it that way, she temporarily released my dick from her mouth, and then narrowed her mouth and touched the tip of my dick.

「Ohhh!」

She looked like she was kissing my dick. And then, she stayed at that position and tightly held the foreskin with her lips, before putting my dick inside her mouth, pulling down the skin along with it. It was inside her mouth so I couldn’t see it, but I could sense that she’d pulled down the foreskin. 

Anna entangled her tongue as if enjoying my uncovered dick. She probably didn’t have any lewd intention and was only desperate to clean my dick, but that was enough to stimulate my lust. It was starting to stand again. My dick, which had suddenly grown larger inside her mouth,  hit her throat, causing Anna to release it from her mouth and cough violently.

As expected, I had restrained myself for ten days, so I felt that I still had semen to release.

「Turn your ass here. We’ll do it one more.」

「Eh…?」

She most likely assumed that it was over since I asked her to clean it. Anna’s expression instantly clouded.

「Didn’t you hear me?」

「No… It’s nothing.」

Just like a while ago, she positioned her upper body on top of the table and turned her ass to my direction me. When I turned over her skirt, semen was sliding down from her vagina. That sight was very lewd.

「Take your skirt off. It’s in the way.」

Anna unfastened the belt on her waist and took off her skirt. I also made her take off her already half pulled down panty, which looked like drawers. It was the same during the time with Minith, this panty which looked like drawers was lacking in appeal. Eve’s string panty was very lovely. I would have them make a modern panty later, I swore in my heart.

I made Anna, whose lower half was naked, turn her ass again towards me. The semen dripping down her thighs was a bother, so I wiped it off using her skirt that was on the side. Her skirt filled with patches appeared like the path in which she’d lived in this city. I felt an indescribable sense of dominance in using her skirt to wipe my semen.

I thrust my dick inside her sweet hole. My semen served as the lubricant, and I was able to push my dick smoothly inside.

「Ohh, your pussy is good.」

The movement of her vagina inside felt very pleasant. Every time I pounded my dick inside her, air would be expelled from inside her vagina, ringing inside the room. There seemed to be a stimulating smell coming from that air, and the indescribable smell spread in the room. It was an irresistible smell, making me thrust faster. The queefing sounded the more I thrust, filling the air with a lewd smell.  

When I realized it, I’d become absorbed in having her make those sounds. 

「Gu, I’m cumming!」

I pounded deep inside her vagina and loosed the semen that was rising again. Although the momentum was slightly weaker than a while ago, I was still stuffing her vagina with my semen.

「Ahh…………Again……」

I lightly slapped Anna’s ass as she was letting out a grieved cry because I ejaculated inside her one more time. The sound from the slap was lovely. My semen that was sliding down from her vagina fell on the floor, and a smell spread in the room. The small room was filled with the intimate smell of a man and woman.

I’d become conscious of my love for breasts recently. I extended my hand but stopped. I couldn’t touch Anna’s breast since she was on top of the table and was facing down.

「This time, lie down on the short table there while facing up.」

The table was only as tall as a kotatsu, so I led her there. Although I would’ve known it if I stood beside her, she was really much taller than me. She was definitely taller than Minith. I could feel the large difference in our height.

I placed Anna facing up on the short table and made her spread her legs wide.

「Hmm, my dick still won’t stand.」

In a missionary position, I pushed my dick inside her vagina, but it didn’t become erect. There was nothing I could do, so I pressed my head on Anna’s breasts. I looked like I was snuggling on her due to the difference in height.

I rolled up the clothing around her chest, which had returned there who knows when, and exposed her breasts.

「Ahh……」

I placed her nipples between my lips, buried my head between her breasts, and then once again sucked her nipples.  After repeating these actions, my dick had gotten erect again, but I still couldn’t stop teasing her breasts.

「Delicious! Your breasts are really great!」

I played with her erect nipples with my tongue and was absorbed in sucking it. I felt like I could continue this forever. 

Sucking a breast made me feel satisfied. If only everyone can suck breasts, we would’ve been able to achieve world peace long ago. I felt like I had reached the boundary of enlightenment.

Still, I couldn’t continue staying here in the shop to suck her breasts. I pulled myself back and then thrust my erect dick inside her vagina while in a missionary position.

「Haa, haa, I’ll release my semen one more time inside you.」

At this moment, I noticed one serious point. Since I was in a missionary position, I would be able to thrust my dick while sucking her breasts. 

When I tried it, I was indeed correct. I was able to enjoy her with my dick pounding her vagina while sucking her breasts. The stimulation from doing both at the same time was beyond description. Even though it was already the third time, I was releasing semen inside Anna again.

After I calmed my rough breathing, I whispered to her.

「Tell me if you get pregnant. At that time, I’ll give you some money, or support you in some way.」

Looking slightly relieved, Anna quietly nodded her head.

Chapter 20: The Main Camp of the Allied Army
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


「It looks like it will still take several days before the peace conference. Until then, you’ll teach me more about Nambonan’s good qualities. 」

Anna’s expression the moment she found out that we would be doing it for several more days was so charming that I felt like I could go for another round.

After we had finished, I fixed my disordered clothes and left the room. Outside, my bodyguards were waiting, and the customers were there too. It seemed like they’ve been waiting until I finished.

「I have judged that your offensive statements were due to the alcohol. However, I don’t want to hear any of it a second time.」

Everyone felt relieved, and at the same time, they voiced their gratitude and concern for Anna. She stayed inside the room. When I left the room, she appeared to be crying while stifling the sound. 

There was a beautiful girl covered in semen inside that room. It might arouse the male customers, so I strictly ordered the shop owner not to let anyone approach her for a while. Additionally, I had something I was curious about, so I decided to ask the shop owner.

「Is that girl single?」

In this world, a 26 years old woman was considered too late to get married. Even though Anna was beautiful and had a good figure, she didn’t look like she had a husband or any engagement because she had pubic hair. 

In this area, there was a custom for a woman who was married or engaged with a lover to shave their pubic hair. I wasn’t sure if it was the same everywhere else, but that culture was popular in the Kingdom and the Empire, at the very least. That was why if a man wanted to find out whether the woman they like was single, they would find out instantly from seeing their pussy. Although I believe it would be faster to ask them directly if they have a lover.

「Y-yes! Anna’s husband died in the epidemic two years ago! Yes!」

The shop owner frantically spoke while his voice cracked from nervousness. I see. I knew there was no way a good woman like Anna would be single. Besides, she wasn’t a virgin.

I went back to the Quordentz’s army camp which was set up in the city and cleaned my body with a wet towel. It was unfortunate that I couldn’t get in a hot bath. The public bathhouse in Nambonan had stopped operating after the city surrendered. I could easily make an open-air bath, but according to my adjutant, if the soldiers found out that I was behaving so carefree in the battlefield, they would underestimate me. It was unfortunate, but I would have to postpone the bath for now.

The night was approaching, but I didn’t have anything to do so I walked around the camp. I went to look at the condition of the soldiers under my command. I also walked to watch the soldiers led by the knights under the Quordentz and grandfather.

The soldiers with free time were spending their time however they want. Some were drinking, while some were sleeping with prostitutes. With so many soldiers moving, prostitutes and merchants would follow the army to do business. 

If I had slept with a prostitute,  Anna wouldn’t have suffered miserably. But I was kind of nervous to do it with an experienced woman.  Above all, I didn’t like any of them. 

I talked with the prostitutes. They said that soldiers would flood on them just because they were a woman. Prostitutes who were not popular in the city went and slipped inside the main camp to earn money.

The soldiers placed in the important locations in the city were forbidden to move without permission, so they were looking forward to changing shifts with the soldiers in the main camp. 

I felt worried that the citizens of an occupied city could easily come inside the main camp, but they’d probably done the measures for that. Even if they try to escape through the camp, there was a moat made with the water from the river to narrow their escape route. Naturally, there would be soldiers positioned in those limited escape routes.

That was why it was like a festival around the main camp.

「Wilk-dono. Did you come to inspect the camp?」

I turned around, and Viscount Galliana was there. I felt like I had been encountering him quite frequently.

「Yes, I have nothing to do, so I’m bored.」

I would have the documents in the warehouse or the books bought in the town to read if I was in Nyuneri Caste, but there was nothing like that here. Even if there was a book, except reading for work, people here recognize pastime reading as a hobby for women. This world already had few entertainments, so I would have nothing to do if I couldn’t even be allowed to read books.

「I see. Then would you like to come to my camp? I’ve received excellent alcohol earlier in the city. It would be waste to drink it all alone.」

「Oh? Deanrish-dono is not here?」

「My son is staying in the tent. He’s probably having fun talking with a young girl than spend time with his father. It was quite a problem since I took him all the way here from the castle.」

Viscount Galliana laughed.

Apparently, Deanrish who had won his first campaign together with me was having sex all day with a girl he liked. If only I had time, I also would’ve taken Eve with me.

In this Nambonan campaign, many nobles nearby the Quordentz territory had participated, including Viscount Galliana. However, they only joined the war for the sake of formality, and their numbers were also few. Compared to Quordentz army’s 60,000 soldiers, the soldiers from all the other families were hardly 10,000. A single noble only sent about 1000 soldiers.

As for why they even joined, they wanted to hold their son’s first campaign. A noble with a son would want to perform their son’s first campaign in a safe battlefield if possible. They would be worried if their son’s first battlefield was in a dangerous war. On the other hand, it wouldn’t look good if they sent their son to deal with bandits and thieves.

On that point, Nambonan campaign was the best. Since Nambonan was a well-known city even in the Empire and the Kingdom, having their first campaign here would sound good. Nambonan’s surroundings were the territory of Quordentz, so there was no problem when thinking about safety. Furthermore, the enemy didn’t have a noble as their lord, so there wouldn’t be anyone with considerable magic power. On top of that, the supreme commander was General Garphis, widely known for being invincible.

When father told them ‘If you want to join to hold your first campaign, you can join’ and spread the invitation, quite a number of them gathered. Father didn’t reveal the reason why he intentionally invited them, but he had a crooked expression, so there was probably a scheme running in there. Since they didn’t have many soldiers with them, they’d arrived faster than us despite leaving later.  However, I never thought they had enough time to bring their favorite woman. 

In the end, the Quordentz army was named the Quordentz’s Allied Army, and the Nambonan war took place.

Judging from the way he invited, It wouldn’t be good as a noble to refuse him without any good reason. I also didn’t have any reason to reject.

Wearing a smile, I answered:

「I see. Then, I’ll accept your invitation. I  also have something I’m curious about Nambonan.」

I would definitely be able to hear interesting stories about Nambonan since he was a former councilor. Led by the viscount, I entered his tent.

「The rumor that the blue demon appeared in a bar has been spreading among the citizens.」

He poured an amber colored alcohol in the glassy goblet made of metal. At the same at as we toasted, he spoke.

「Nambonan is trembling from being watched by the red and blue demon.」

It tasted like the apricot wine in my previous world, sweet and delicious.

「Viscount Galliana remained in the city?」

I went inside the city with him this morning and returned to the main camp before lunch. Since he heard the news, then he most likely stayed in the city. 

「Yes, I took both lunch and dinner in the city.  I secretly took a meal at the restaurant, and I was able to hear many interesting gossips.」

Was he talking about how a bar’s idol was raped?

「I heard that there were people plotting to rebel against the Quordentz allied army in the bar. They said that the blue demon, who apparently heard of it, became so enraged that he immediately sent their heads flying.」

「Eh?」

「The blue demon was unable to calm his anger with just their blood, so he pointed his sword towards the customers and released his magic power.」

「Eh…」

「Amidst the overwhelming magic power, a waitress working in the store stood in front of the blue demon and talked about their love for Nambonan to show that they did not have any intention of rebelling. In the end, she was able to appease the blue demon.」

They were completely treating me like a demon god… That wasn’t completely wrong from a commoners point of view about nobles.[1]

According to him, it was apparently a hot topic in the restaurant. Viscount Galliana continued while displaying a smile.

「So, what’s the truth?」

His expression was completely telling that I was the main culprit. However, he looked like he just wanted a conversation topic rather than seeking the truth. I judged that rather than telling him the truth, continuing with this rumor would avoid the dirty parts, and that would be good for me.

「Haha, the details seemed to have become slightly exaggerated. Rumors sure are scary.」

I spoke about the Nambonan’s Story of Success that I’d heard from Anna to change the topic. Then, I turned to a subject relating to Nambonan’s council.

「Viscount Galliana was a council member before, right? I’m not knowledgeable about the council. Can I ask what kind of group it is?」

「Sure.」

Face slightly proud, Viscount Galliana started his story.

Nambonan’s Highest Decision-Making Body, Council.It was a group consisting of ten members. The citizens would elect one member for every district, and since there were five districts in the city, only a total of five members would be elected. The remaining five seats would be chosen through a discussion held by the five elected councilors. Merchant’s held the priority in Nambonan, so it was a custom to choose from the influential merchants to sit on the remaining five council seats.

「The citizens choose the first five councilors based on their popularity and character.」

 『Even if you tell us to choose who would manage the city, we don’t know which among them is good.』

『I heard Person A in my district is a good person, and he also has a wide network of connection.』

『In that case, we can just have Person A choose someone who knows how to manage the city.』

That kind of thought process was apparently the foundation of Nambonan’s civil administration. In this case, Person A would be elected as a councilor, and then he would nominate a capable Person B to become a councilor.

From the citizen’s point of view, they just had to vote a trustworthy person in their district.

「The five elected councilors would manage the city, for the most part. That was the case when I was a councilor.」

Whether elected or nominated, the ten councilors held equal authority, so the nominated councilors only held five votes in the decisions. A decision wouldn’t be approved without the majority voting for it, so they need at least one vote from the elected councilors. Policies that prioritized business and neglect the citizens were rejected, said the Viscount.

When I nodded, a waiter poured alcohol in my empty goblet.

「How will Wilk-dono evaluate the council for choosing this time’s conclusion?」

Viscount Galliana’s eyes were serious.

His eyes felt like he was trying to assess the other party’s value. I judged that I shouldn’t give a careless response.

Let’s see, how should I answer him?

Chapter 21: Viscount Galliana and the Council
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If I would describe them with a word:

「Inadequate.」

「That is to say?」

「It seems like they’ve failed to choose between the merchant’s and the citizen’s opinion.」

Viscount Galliana stroked his beard and prompted me to continue. I moistened my tongue with the alcohol in the cup and continued.

「After hearing the customer’s opinions in the bar, there seemed to be differing views between the merchants and the citizens.」

Many citizens believed that the council was way too quick to surrender. Many merchants believed that the council was way too late to surrender.

Their views were roughly like that.

The citizens loved Nambonan and tried to protect it to an extent. They’d prioritized their feeling of wanting to protect their home rather than the loss they would suffer in the war.

「I agree. Compared to the time when I was a councilor, there are many more citizens who are very attached to Nambonan.」

「So that was indeed the case.」

Conversely, the merchants had immediately given up. Carefully thinking about it, Nambonan’s surroundings were already under the Quordentz. It was already evident at this point that there was no chance of victory. If Quordentz had blocked the road, Nambonan would be easily cut off. The reason we didn’t do it was because it would take time and Nambonan would weaken, which would lead to lesser profits for us.

「That’s why, from the merchant’s view, they would either find a way to solve the situation before the Quordentz completely control the surrounding, or quickly surrender at the time when they’d been marked and negotiate a point of compromise. Like in this war, it was already too late to surrender after we’ve put them in a disadvantaged position.」

「They’ve taken many measures to protect their independence. Behind the scenes, they’d been assisting the nobles from Jinkaen Empire who were fighting with the Quordentz house. They also seemed to be making use of the connections that I’ve made with the other forces back when I was a councilor. 」

The revelation from the former council member only left me shocked. Apparently, they not only had connections with Jinkaen Empire but also with the others including the Holy Navenphos and the Mamshred Federation.

「Is it fine to tell me those things…?」

「There’s no problem, since this war has started because I’ve leaked the information to the Quordentz.」

What! Nambonan’s star and the so-called savior Viscount Galliana was the spark that ignited this war. If the citizens were to hear about that, their eyes might turn vacant. 

He said that my father had long been suspicious about Nambonan operating behind the scenes. Upon receiving the report from Viscount Galliana, he finally felt inclined to move the army.

「As Wilk-dono said, if I were a council member, I would quickly increase my cards. If I couldn’t do that, I would choose to be under Quordentz’s umbrella. I could expect enough development if Nambonan were to stand as a city under Quordentz, even if it means losing the city’s independence.」

「In the council, the five nominated councilors most likely thought the same thing.」

Viscount Galliana slowly nodded. I continued.

「I’m not familiar with the councilors, so I could only speak based on the actual events.」

「Please, let me hear about it.」

Viscount Galliana placed the goblet in his hand on the table.

「In the council, I think that a proposal to surrender came out at the beginning and was rejected.」

Naturally, the ones who made the proposal were the nominated merchant councilors. They wouldn’t choose to fight because they knew that they couldn’t win.

「The elected councilors are well aware just how much the citizens love Nambonan. Perhaps even they felt the same attachment. The citizens might be disappointed if they voted to surrender.」

Could the councilors still approve the proposal knowing that? The answer was apparent. Since Nambonan hadn’t immediately surrendered at the start, they rejected the proposal.

「They refuse to approve the proposal to surrender. But can they win? They can’t. How problematic.」

While saying that, the Viscount leaned forward looking here. I wouldn’t be happy even if a man were to lean forward.

「That’s why they wanted to make them understand. Not the elected councilors, but the citizens.」

「Hoh.」

「They needed to make the citizens understand just how powerful Quordentz is by engaging them once in a large scale battle. By doing so, the criticisms towards the councilors who chose to surrender would lessen. 」

In short, they made it easier for the elected councilors to approve the proposal to surrender.

「So it was that battle in the field, wasn’t it? It was surprising that they were able to gather so many mercenaries.」

Our enemies in the battle that had taken place in a location slightly far away from Nambonan were mercenaries. As for what the volunteer army made up of citizens were doing, they were protecting the city walls.

「I think the councilors couldn’t take it to send the citizens to their death.」

「If I were the councilors, I would surely send the volunteer army to the field. If they died, then good. If not, they would go back to the city and spread fear.」

Then, the mercenaries who assembled in the field had run away. The mercenaries knew the terror of General Garphis, who had trampled on the Empire’s lands. They’d judged that it was suicide to battle him. And they were indeed correct.

The mercenaries had begun to run away, but grandfather didn’t intend to let them escape. The searing wave that my grandfather had released attacked them, which instantly caused them to fall into fear.

I also mimicked that magic and released a bluish wave of flames arranged like the flames from a gas stove, and burned many of the mercenaries to death. Grandfather’s crimson flames and my blue flames met in the field, and the land where both armies were facing each other had quickly transformed into a scorching field.

Would you like to help the Quordentz eliminate the mercenaries? It’s simple! Just fire your magic in the direction the officer is pointing. The mercenaries had collapsed, and while they were fleeing in all directions, the young noblemen who had joined to achieve their first campaign attacked them from behind.

The other noble’s army took great pains to capture the mercenaries alive. The reason being, it was allowed to sell the mercenaries who had become prisoners as slaves. 

「In the end, the hired mercenaries only ran away without fighting. From the citizen’s view, the mercenaries probably looked like they didn’t fight at all, even though they had fought and won back when the former lord returned. They must’ve been furious at the mercenaries for being disgraceful.」

「That experience wasn’t a good thing for them. They had the stupid belief that they could also resist against the Quordentz just because they were able to drive away that incompetent former lord. Yes, both might be nobles, but the difference is like heaven and earth. That noble was famous even in the Empire as a good-for-nothing noble.」

He was already a worthless noble, and after he met his defeat in Nambonan, he had apparently become a laughingstock in the Empire’s noble society for being a trash noble who lost even against commoners.

「And so, the battle ended fruitlessly, without causing any change to the citizens. But it was probably different for the councilors. Upon seeing the Quordentz’s Allied Army, they’ve probably thought that the citizens might get killed at this rate.」

This was something I’d understood after gaining the control of the city. Apparently, they’d immediately decided to surrender after losing in the field. When the decision to surrender had been announced to the citizens, the citizens who were defending the city and were fully ready to fight had become enraged and marched into the council. 

The Quordentz’s Allied Army had arrived perfectly in time and attacked the city wall. Since many citizens marched into the council and there were fewer people defending it, we’d quickly gained control of the walls.

The defensive battle in the city wall was no doubt the worse report for the councilors who had been thinking of searching a point of compromise on their surrender.

The messenger who had immediately come to declare their intention to surrender after we’d taken control of the city gate had an expression as if he’d given birth to all of this world’s despair.

「The citizen’s viewed the council as a coward for surrendering without a fight, while the merchant’s viewed the council as foolish for putting up a meaningless fight and placing them at a disadvantage in the negotiation table.」

「I’m so glad that I quit being a council member.」

Viscount Galliana clapped his hands while laughing.

「If they’ve surrendered or resolved themselves to defend, we would’ve been the one in trouble. We should thank the council for their half-assed decision.」

If they had negotiated to surrender early on, there would be no guarantee that they would accept our every demand. Conversely, our loses would’ve been huge if they had fought to the bitter end. A people’s army trying to protect their freedom was terrifyingly powerful, as seen on Earth’s history. In this world where the noble’s possessed exceptional power, we most likely wouldn’t lose. However, we would have wiped out the citizens in the worst case.

I turned my goblet towards the waiter and asked for another. Viscount Galliana also downed his glass and requested for another.

「It was an enjoyable discussion. Wilk-dono seems to understand a lot about the citizens despite being a high noble.」

Viscount Galliana raised his glass, so I raised mine, and we clinked our glasses. 

Our discussion about Nambonan’s council ended there.

Afterward, we talked a little about Nambonan’s government. It was already very late at night by the time I had returned to my camp.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 22: Peace Conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Three days had passed since I drank together with Viscount Galliana. These three had passed peacefully.

「Wilk, It seems like you’ve done great on the battlefield. Everyone was saying ‘as expected of the son of Quordentz’, including your grandfather… Well done.」

「Thank you, father.」

Today, my father had finally arrived at Nambonan. The reason that the Allied Army had been standing by here was that they were waiting for Marquis Quordentz’s arrival. When grandfather and I had left from Nyuneri, it took us around a week before we arrived since we also joined up with the army midway. My busy father said that he arrived in around two days because he hurried with a small force.

「Let’s get down to business and tell them our demands. Are you ready?」

Father didn’t have the slightest intention to negotiate, and he intended to end it by pushing our demands unilaterally. It was a very noble-like response.

The preparations for the peace conference seemed to have been finished, and the civil officers who had been working in the main camp until now began explaining to father. As a result, they had immediately prepared the place for the negotiations. A messenger hurried inside the city to notify Nambonan’s council. 

「I’ll enter the city after this. Wilk, you’re coming too.」

「I understand.」

As I was wondering why I was going too, father continued.

「I heard that you are studying hard about Nambonan’s situation and the council. Viscount Galliana told me that it might be good to have you attend today’s conference.」

「I see.」

「Don’t worry. In the conference, Viscount Galliana will be the one to talk to them, for the most part. Just show a firm attitude and glare at them.」

Apparently, Viscount Galliana was in charge to speak at the conference. It would be undignified for a Marquis to speak too much to commoners, so leaving the task to him, who was known as Nambonan’s star, would be appropriate.

While I was thinking of that, the guards had gathered around us.

「Master. The guards are all ready.」

「Then, let’s go.」

Father was riding on a horse, so I was also riding one today. Surrounded by guards, we passed through the city gates and entered inside the city.

When we drew near the Y intersection, the person leading the way proceeded to the right side. I unconsciously looked towards the left road. That was the direction of Anna’s bar. I hadn’t been able to have sex with her today yet.

「Wilk, what’s the matter? Is there anything in that direction?」

Father, who had noticed my look, asked. While I was thinking how to cover up the matter, grandfather spoke while laughing.

「Lukes, dont ask your son! A girl he likes is in that direction.」

Gahaha, with a laugh, grandfather said loudly.

Anyone under the Quordentz already knew that I had been having sex with Anna these past few days, but it was still embarrassing to hear someone say it.

「Hoh, I see. Having sex with a woman inside an occupied territory… That’s just like my brother. It brings back memories. 」

Father’s eyes as he looked at me was neither one that was happy about his child’s growth nor was it an old geezer enjoying dirty talk. It was the eyes of a person looking at something nostalgic, someone he cared about.

「I felt the same too. Wilk is similar to Gardakul. The residence will probably be crowded with women again.」

Then, they’d begun talking about my father’s brother, in other words, my uncle. My uncle died before I was born, so I’d never met him. He was originally going to succeed the Quordentz family, but because he died in a war, father was the one who succeeded. Hearing father talked about the past I understood that he loved and respected uncle. I only had the image that brothers of noble birth would fight each other for succession, so it was unexpected for me.

Speaking of the residence where I raped Eve, it was apparently a residence built to keep my uncle’s woman, a lovemaking residence. It seemed like I’d been using it correctly.

As the horses moved forward, we had arrived at the castle in the middle of the city. The castle was known as Nambonan Castle, but its appearance was only like a small fort. Unlike Nyuneri Castle’s European-style appearance, Nambonan Castle appeared very shabby.  According to Anna, they’d just turned the former lord’s castle into the council’s office, so it naturally maintained its appearance. As the buildings surrounding the castle were splendid, it seemed to reveal Nambonan’s poor condition back then.

After the guard standing in front of the castle lowered his head down, the gate was opened.

「This is our demand—no, decision.」

The conference began with us meeting with the ten councilors face-to-face. It had started quickly and also ended quickly. There was no room for negotiation. 

The parchment that Viscount Galliana presented had been handed over to the councilor in the rightmost side and then given to the councilor beside him after he had finished reading it. His eyes opened widely before placing his hand to cover his face, and then he handed it to the counsilor beside him as if he was giving something revolting.

However, only the first five councilors reacted that way.

「Oh?」

As if he was feeling disappointed for preparing himself since he saw the other five councilors’ discouraged behavior, that councilor let out a voice. He sometimes looked dissatisfied, but it was much better than the first five councilors. He passed the parchment to another councilor,  and that councilor also made the same reaction.

After being passed around, they gave the parchment to me.

「Hmm.」

The details were simple.

Maintain the current status. Nambonan would become a territory of the Quordentz, but they would be allowed to run the city as they did up until now. However, an organization with higher authority than the council would be established, and people under the Quordentz would take the post.

All of the city’s walls protecting it from rebellion would belong to the Quordentz, and it would be demolished. Nambonan would be responsible for the cost of demolishing it. The councilors who had caused the war would have all their properties confiscated, and their status reduced to a slave. Additionally, Nambonan City would have to pay reparations to Quordentz. They could pay in installments.

The volunteer army wouldn’t be questioned for their crime as long as they disarmed. Anyone who refused to obey this order would be executed. Depending on the situation, their families would be executed alongside them.

As I continued on reading, the execution list was in the last, and names were written in it. All names included in the list would be executed without any questions.

「Please wait!」

「Kill him.」

The councilor sitting first in the right stood up and was beheaded by the guard upon receiving the order from father. Fresh blood scattered inside the assembly hall.

 「That person rebelled. Therefore, his family will be executed too.」 

As though telling a fact, father said indifferently. The councilors, including me, felt fear upon hearing his emotionless voice.

This was a noble.

「Although he was scheduled to be executed, his family would’ve been pardoned if he stayed quiet…」

Viscount Galliana said regretfully, so that the councilors could hear it. I see. So the person a while ago was included in the execution list. No wonder he was desparate.

「Decide.」

Father said mercilessly. There wasn’t a single councilor who opposed.

Just like that, the peace conference had come to a smooth end.

The next day.

Father had returned to Nyuneri early in the morning. It seemed that the remaining instructions from now on would be sent through letters.

I’d come to the residence of one of the councilors. As for what I came here to do, I was here to confiscate their properties. A civil officer expert on these matters would perform the job, but since this was the residence of one of Nambonan’s representatives, there was a need to prevent them from doing anything on their own. 

Therefore, I was asked to watch over the place while they confiscated the properties. The rumor about the blue demon seemed to have spread in a more exaggerated way, making the councilors tremble the whole time.

Entering the residence which looked more splendid than Nambonan Castle, the soldiers were taking the properties under orders from the civil officer. They were moving a large number of gold coins, bundles of something that looked like a certificate of title, and several fine arts. Nambonan seemed to have been really making money. 

The residence looked great, and its location was good too. Above all, it was wonderful that it had a bath. I thought about sneaking there to take a bath later.

While I was looking at the empty house after everything with value had been taken away, I noticed someone standing in a daze. A servant?

「Kohali, our father has avoided execution. Stay strong!」

「Brother…? Even so, we’ve lost everything.… The servants… No one’s here anymore… Father has been reduced into a slave… Ah… How could this happen…」

The man who appeared to be the girl’s brother consoled the young girl called Kohali, who was muttering incoherently. While I was looking at them, a civil officer nearby approached me with the soldiers.

「Young Master. The confiscation has been completed. We will be heading to another councilor’s residence. What will Young Master do now?」

「Go ahead. I’ve found something that hasn’t been collected yet.」

Misunderstanding it that I had pointed out his mistake, the civil officer paled and stood straight.  I grinned and pointed at that property. The civil officer made an understanding look and then left the residence after giving a bow.

Confirming that the soldiers had left, I stood in front of the remaining two.

「Oh? So there’s still a remaining property in here.」  

I felt blood going down my lower-half.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 23: Deliciously Eating the Merchant’s Daughter?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I stepped loudly with my leather shoes, and the clacking sound echoed clearly inside the empty residence.

「… There’s nothing left in here anymore. Is the house going to be confiscated too? In that case, we’ll leave immediately.」 

The man who looked here was probably the brother of that girl named Kohali. Their hair color differed, but their facial features were kind of similar.

I looked at Kohali. Even though she appeared almost like an adult, her large eyes not fitting her age was impressive.  I could feel her childishness from her attitude of entrusting everything to her brother without being able to do anything herself. Seeing that she was wearing a beautiful dress even though she’d just been driven out from their house, she lacked a sense of danger. I would say that she was a sheltered young girl who grew up in a wealthy house without ever experiencing any suffering.

Curly hairs were common in the Empire and the Kingdom, and girls with silky hair were rare, but Kohali had a beautiful straight hair. The contrast between her dark silver hair hanging down and covering her small chest and her deep red eyes was beautiful.

「I will confiscate the residence. Leave behind everything with value.」 

If it was in the previous world, I might’ve gotten questioned for taking the properties of the family members even though the one who received the punishment of confiscation was only their parent. 

However, on paper, everything belonged to the head of the family. In other words, if the family head received a seizure of property as punishment, naturally the family’s properties would be confiscated too.

「Our house…?! Brother!」 

 「Don’t cry, Kohali. We’ve indeed lost everything including our business, but let’s do our best together! Just like our father back when he was young, let’s start peddling. Then we’ll be able to have a house like this one again.」  

Kohali buried her head on her brother’s chest with her shoulders trembling.  Seeing the intimacy between the brother and sister, I felt excited. I wonder why?

I wish I could return to the castle and admire Fanny…

「Is this confiscated too, sir?」 

Kohali’s brother showed a small bag hanging on his waist. Judging from the rattling sounds, gold coins perhaps?

When I received the bag and looked inside it, there were around ten gold coins used mostly in the Kingdom and the Empire, and three cylinder-shaped minerals. It was the size of an AAA battery in my previous world. It was transparent, but the light that passed through it was casting a rainbow shadow. It was a beautiful gemstone.

「Hm? Is this perhaps a Manal mineral?」 

「Oh, you know about it? That is a Manal crystal. A Manal vein has been discovered recently.」  

 「Hoh. So this is a Manal crystal. I’ve read it in a book.」

This would be a good thing to relieve my boredom. I’d decided to write a letter to my father to ask him to share some to me. I confiscated the small bag.

 「Please excuse us. Let’s go, Kohali.」  

I called out towards the two who were about to leave the room as if it was over. There was still a property.

「Wait.」  

 「Is there anything else?」  

「You two still have something valuable, don’t you? Leave it behind.」   

Kohali’s brother made a troubled expression and shook his head. He most likely didn’t have coins or jewels on him.

「Sir, I’m sorry. We’re already penniless, and we don’t have anything left.」   

They tried to leave the room after saying that, so I gave them a final warning.

「If you leave this room, I’ll consider it that you’re trying to walk off with the valuables, and I’ll execute you two.」   

The two twitched and stopped moving. Seeing the brother turned with an expressionless face, no doubt he thought that they got caught by an annoying person.

「We don’t really have anything with value left on us.」  

「What’s that?」   

I pointed at the brother.   

「What are you referring to?」    

「I’m referring to that coat with beautiful patterned embroidery.」 

A fine and delicate embroidery using a black thread was attached to the bright yellow fabric that was dyed extravagantly. His clothes looked more expensive than the annual income of the commoners.

「I understa— no, can you please at least spare my clothing? please show mercy.」 

He was willing to remove his coat, but he seemed to have noticed of my intention midway while speaking.  He went down on his knees and bowed low. 

「…Brother?」 

Kohali looked like she didn’t understand the situation. She was looking strangely at her brother who suddenly went down on his knees. I ignored her and looked down on her brother.

「I won’t repeat myself.」  

I had no interest watching a man strip. If I had, the story would’ve become ‘The Marquis’ Eldest Son’s BL Story’.[1]

「Ku…」   

Frustrated, Kohali’s brother stripped his coat off. He then folded it neatly and placed it on the floor.

「Your wearing a good leather belt, aren’t you? Is the design gold?」   

「Ahh, Brother. Brother… why are you…」 

「Kohali, don’t look!」    

Again, I had no interest in watching a man strip. 

「Hmph. It seems like you’ve finally given all your valuables.」  

「Please, please let us off!」  

I made sure not to include Kohali’s naked brother in my view as much as possible. I didn’t want to see the sea slug-like thing between his legs.

「You can go now. It’s your turn Kohali, or whatever you’re called. It looks like you’re wearing a fancy dress.」  

「Sir! Please! Please let her off! She’s still a pure young girl!」   

Kohali finally looked liked she understood what I wanted. She was trembling with her hands on her chest.

「Is the material for that dress from Nyuneri?」 

「Eeeek!」  

 Kohali was scared, but since her brother was kneeling on the ground naked, she couldn’t hide anywhere. 

「Please wait! Is this confiscation really permitted?!」  

The naked brother stood up with his dick shaking, and then he questioned about the state of things. The brother stood up to protect his sister, how cool.

「It is permitted.」   

「Then let me verify it with the council!」    

I spread my mantle and showed it to Kohali’s naked brother who had lost his temper.

「This, is…」    

「Do you want to verify it with the council? It will be very interesting whether they’d permit my Quordentz to confiscate all the properties of the merchant who had caused us harm. No doubt they would vote for it unanimously.」 

Like Viscount Galliana had said, Nambonan’s council had been moving behind the scenes, and they interfered with Quordentz’s actions. The execution list under the peace treaty had covered only the malicious merchants, but that didn’t mean that those not included were not guilty. Being a council member at that time was already the same as agreeing to the covert activities. There wouldn’t be anything strange if they were to get executed.

Besides, I didn’t violate the agreement. The seizure of the properties was included in the agreement. At most, I would be permitted to cut off her hair and sell it. Beautiful hairs would sell well, especially Kohali’s beautiful straight hair. It would surely sell for a high price.

「It seems like you don’t understand it. The fact that you two are still alive right now already shows our compassion.」 

 「That…!」 

Ignoring the naked brother, I looked at Kohali who had been watching the situation. I raised a finger, and pointed it.

「I’m confiscating all the properties. That dress looks like its a valuable.」

Chapter 24: Deliciously Eating the Merchant’s Daughter (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


A young girl’s strip show would begin now. I glanced at the guard and commanded him to leave the room. The brother and sister didn’t have magic, so it would be unlikely for them to hurt me even if they had a sharp weapon. The guard quietly left the room.

Kohali let out a slightly relieved breath upon seeing the male guard leave the room. Then she darted her eyes around as if she was thinking of something, before stopping at her naked brother. She then glanced up at me.

「You need my dr, dress, right?」

Rather than an inquiring tone, she sounded more like a child acting spoiled and saying ‘I’m scared! I don’t want this, so forgive me, okay?’. She seemed to know that acting in such a way would cause people to be soft. It was probably the servants and her parents who usually pampered her. Of course, I wouldn’t do such thing.

「Right. Hurry up and hand over your clothes. Didn’t your brother show how it’s done?」

「Eeek…」

Unable to believe that I would say such a thing, her red eyes opened so widely. She looked at her naked brother for help, but he only shut his mouth quietly.

「I, I understand…」

Kohali resolved herself and moved her arms to take her dress off. Her movement was annoyingly slow. However, her movement stopped shortly. Then with a regretful expression, she said.

「I’m sorry, I can’t remove my dress without the help of servants. So…」 

「Don’t you have your brother? Ask him to take it off.」 

Her naked brother looked at me with a startled expression. However, I didn’t know how to remove a dress. I could also remove the dress by force, but I really wanted to watch a sheltered young girl undress.

「I can do it if you don’t want your brother to help you.」

I drew the sword hanging on my waist and pointed it at Kohali. Seeing that, her brother quickly stood up between us.

「I’ll help her take off her dress! Please lower your sword!」

I stared at the naked brother for a short while before returning my sword to the sheath with an intentional sound. Her brother felt relieved, turned around, and went behind Kohali.

「Kohali, I’ll help you remove… remove your dress.」

「But… Brother…」

「I understand your frustration, but you have to endure it. If we refuse here, we don’t know what might happen to our father who has just avoided execution.」

Kohali looked at her brother in shock. I hope she remembered her own position now. 

The dress that Kohali was wearing wasn’t spread out like the wedding dress in my previous world. It looked like a one-piece dress that extended all the way to her feet. Her dress tightly enveloped her chest without emphasizing her breasts, and the part that covered the shoulder straps and her two arms were one. Her white dress looking like it had a blend of light green that made use of the fabric’s color was tailored with a truly stunning design.

There were several fastened strings on the back. I think the dress would be removed by undoing those strings. Kohali’s figure with her eyes tighly shut while looking downwards as she endured the embarassment was very adorable.

「Is this it…?」

Looking at her naked brother, he was fumbling on her back and was smoothly unfastening the strings. After he finished undoing all the strings on her back, the dress seemed to have rolled up, so he was trying his best to remove it by pulling it down and from the sides.

「Um, brother. Its, its like this.」

Since her backside had been opened and she had more space to move, it seemed like she could remove her arms from the dress. While thinking of using it for future reference, I enjoyed the young girl’s strip show. Dress designed with many strings seemed to be popular nowadays.

Kohali’s embarrassed appearance every time a string around her dress was untied looked very erotic. It made me wonder whether this kind of design had been popularized because it was pleasing to watch when stripping.

「The dress will come off after this one… Kohali, are you alright?」

「… Yes.」

Kohali prepared herself and closed her eyes as she turned her face toward the ceiling. With a rustling sound, the dress fell down the floor. A part of her dress had been stuck on her waist, preventing it from completely falling down, so her brother pulled and slid it down.

「Hoh.」

There was a thin one-piece under the dress. The one-piece, which made her body line stand out, was deep ultramarine in color and its length extended to her knees. Probably because she was wearing underwear, it looked stiff.

「Ahhh……Why did things turn out this way?」

Kohali bent while hugging her body. I looked at her naked brother and ordered him to take the one-piece off.

「Kohali.」

「Brother… I’m sorry… I’m sorry…」

「Kohali, I’m sorry. I should be the one apologizing to you. Forgive me for being unable to protect you…」

The naked brother grasped the hem of Kohali’s one-piece as she covered her face both hands. Then, he raised it. It seemed like he intended to remove it by lifting it up this time.

Her drawers-looking panty showed up, and when it was further raised up, it got stuck on her arms.

「Raise your hands, Kohali. Please.」

「Y, yes…」

Kohali’s brother held her arms while apologizing and then raised the one-piece along with it. While getting stuck on her face and hair, the one-piece passed through her head and was placed on the floor.

「You’re almost done. What a naughty underwear.」

When I said that to cheer them, the brother averted his eyes. That panty which looked like drawers wasn’t appealing at all. However, her corset bra was very good. Her waistline tightly covered and the cup was enveloping her breasts. This was really great.

I’d always loved bras than panties even in the previous world. When I watched adult videos, the scene when the bra was being removed was the most arousing. I would get furious when the breasts suddenly bounce out the instant the bra was taken off, which often happened in erotic manga in my previous world.

They probably felt like it was troublesome to draw a bra with many frills and laces, but I wish they’d properly draw them. There were so many erotic manga where the breasts would jump out the moment they take off their school uniform. Just what kind of school were they in? Properly wear your bra! I believe that the sight when a woman’s soft breasts were covered by a frilly and attractive bra was one of the sexiest things in the world.

「I didn’t properly see it since you were wearing a dress, but you sure have a sexy figure. It’s the kind of naughty body that men like.」

Her naked brother looked like he was leaning forward for some reason, am I just imagining it? I didn’t know what was happening with his dick since he was covering it with his hand. Well, I didn’t want to know anyway.

I calmly observed Kohali’s panty and bra.

「Remove her panty first.」

When I ordered his brother, Kohali refused with her hand.

「Umm, brother… I’ll take it off myself.」

Saying that, Kohali placed her fingers on her panty. Maybe because she was embarrassed, she didn’t pull her panty down immediately but slowly, causing it to look erotic. She looked like she was teasing.

When a part of her private area became visible, she covered it with her hand, and she squatted down as she dropped her panty all the way to her feet.

「……Brother, I have taken it off.」

「Uh, huh……」

Seeing that I was trying to peek, Kohali sat down on the spot. She sat with her legs bent beside her ass, and covered her important area with her palm.[1] Her calf and plump thighs were pushing against each other, and her palm was covering her private her. There was nothing more arousing than a half-naked young girl taking such a pose.

「Next is your bra. Hurry up!」

My dick was already standing hard.

Her naked brother followed my order and moved his fingers on Kohali’s back, and then the bra’s hook was suddenly released.

「Ah!」

As if a young girl who had her bikini string loosened, Kohali held her bra with both hands to stop it from falling from her chest. Then, the hand covering her private area had left, and I fixed my eyes on it.

「Noo!」

Noticing my gaze, Kohali moved the hand on her chest to cover her private area, but her hand slipped, and the bra on her chest came off, revealing her breasts. Her small but shapely breasts appeared. It was only for an instant, but her burried nipples became visible. 

「This is everything. Please take it.」

Her naked brother, whose dick had become erect, handed over the clothes. 

Kohali’s panty and other clothes, which she had been wearing a while ago, were slightly warm. The erect brother turned his back towards me, while Kohali was facing down, desperately covering her face with her arms and legs.

I casually smelled the area where her corset bra was embracing her breasts. It smelled slightly sweet, causing my dick to become harder. It was a smell that would make men crazy.

「I’ve certainly confiscated all the properties. Well then, I will be seizing the mansion, too. You two can leave.」

「That…!」

「…Going out, like this, naked…I don’t want…We don’t even know… who might be watching…」

Her brother kneeled down again as he spoke.

His dick which was pressing on his stomach entered my sight. I really wanted to lop it off.

「Its fine even if it’s an old cloth, please can we have something? I’ll do anything. Please.」

「Hmm. In that case, you should just sell what you can sell. Aren’t you merchant?」

There was only one thing they could sell. Kohali’s brother realized it instantly.

 「You want Kohali to pretend like a prostitute?!」 

「Doing such a thing… That’s too much…」

Seeing the brother and sister fall in despair, I corrected their misunderstanding.

「She’s not going to pretend like one. She’ll be a prostitute since she will sell her body.」

The two didn’t respond.

Both of them looked dejected, so I threated them with my magic to make them move in front of the room’s door.

「If you have nothing to sell, then leave this mansion. Get out.」

I stuck my sword towards the back of the two and forced them to walk. Kohali’s small but well-shaped ass as it shook every time she walked was very charming. The siblings, who had lived in this mansion, had probably noticed that we were nearing the gate. I noticed that they slowed their pace.

「If you stop walking, I’ll stab you!」

「…!」

And then, we’d arrived at the entrance. It was already outside the mansion beyond this door. I gave them the final warning.

「Are you going to walk around the city naked, or are you selling your body? I’ll let you choose. This will be the last time.」

Then, Kohali looked at me with determination in her eyes.

「If… If I sell my body, will my brother receive clothes too?」

「Kohali!? Dont do it!」

The brother grabbed Kohali’s shoulders as his erect penis shook. Kohali turned her face away from it.

「I’ll prepare money and clothes for you two.」 

Feeling relieved from hearing my words, Kohali held  his brother’s hand.

「Brother… You’ve always protected me… This time, I’ll protect brother. I’m scared, but… I’ll do my best.」

Lowering my sword, I allowed the two of them to return to the room.

Chapter 25: Deliciously Eating the Marchant’s Daughter (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I wanted to have sex with Kohali right away, but there was one major problem. Since the soldiers confiscated everything with value, there was neither a bed nor a futon in here. Of course, I wouldn’t want to have sex on the floor. Kohali’s pretty back would be covered with a bruise.

「I should have ordered them to leave a futon behind.」

There was no use regretting at this point. Going out now to take one would be dumb and uncool.

「I wanted to at least clean my body…」

Upon hearing Kohali lament, I remembered something. This residence had a large bath.

「In that case, let’s enjoy ourselves at the bath. Come.」

Just as I was about to head to the bathroom, Kohali looked at her erect brother with worry.

「Brother… Please come with us… I’m afraid… to be together alone with a man…」

Kohali tightly pressed her hands together and said with a tearful voice. Her brother looked worried too, and he repeatedly shifted his eyes between me and Kohali.

It wasn’t like he would be joining us, so it was fine. I waved my hand and answered:

「Suit yourself.」

The bath was built in the courtyard. Surrounded by a Camellia hedge, a gazebo was built over a large rock.[1] There was a hole in the form of a bathtub dug in the large rock which had been cut through with a cross area of around six and a half tatami mats. 

It was literally a rock bath. 

The rock was probably originally a large one. Perhaps they’d polished the area, its smooth texture was great. 

Of course, there was no water inside the rock bath.

「How are we going to get hot water?」

According to Kohali, the servants would boil the water and carry it here every time they would use the bath. All the servants had been dismissed, and we were the only one in here, so it seemed like they didn’t know what to do.

I suppressed my magic power as much as possible and activated magic. A ball of water the size of a balance ball had appeared in the empty space.

「Oh!」

The ball of water floated gently in the air, moved above the bath, and then fell down with a splash. I increased my magic output and repeated throwing a ball of water. Afterwards, I tossed a boiling ball of water until the bath water reached the right temperature.

As steam rose from the water and spread around, I pushed my hand in to check that the temperature was just right.

「Take off my clothes.」

I spread my arms and turned towards Kohali. She looked towards her brother and asked for help without a word, but I shook my head to show my disapproval. I didn’t want a man to take off my clothes. 

「I understand…」

Kohali touched my clothes with slow and clumsy hand movements. Her brother at the side was giving guidance on how to remove the parts that she couldn’t remove. Although slow, she was surely removing the clothes that were suppressing my lust.

「Um… I’ll, I’ll take it off…」

When she finally removed my underwear, my penis jumped out and pointed upwards, as if it couldn’t wait anymore.

「Eeek!  Oh my…!」

Since she’d been squatting to remove my underwear, my hot and twitching dick had been pushed out in front of her. Her small fine-shaped breasts shook as she stood up to escape.

「Where are you going? Come here.」

Her brother was leaning on the gazebo’s pillar and was looking here.

I would have him slowly watch as her cute little sister bloom as a woman.

「Brother…」

「Kohali…」

The brother and sister looked at each other while hiding their private area. I hugged Kohali from behind to separate them.

As Kohali was slightly taller than me, my dick had been caught between her ass and thighs.

I understood that there was no helping it since I was only 12 years old, but I’d only been having sex with older women. I wanted to have sex with a girl close to my age once in a while.

「Uuuh.. Brother…」

「What’s the matter? Don’t you want clothes and money? You’ll need money to release your father from his slave status. If you’re a merchant, shouldn’t you grab all the opportunities?」

I repeatedly kissed her back and slipped my hand on her breasts. Although her body was trembling, she didn’t resist. When I buried my finger on her breast, I felt an elastic feeling as if my finger was being pushed back, and then I heard a muffled moan sound from Kohali’s throat.

「…nmhmm…..nmhnm….」

I pushed my finger on her nipples, but there was only the areola. When I carefully looked for it, her nipples seemed like they were really buried. As I was stimulating the area where the treasure was most likely buried, a bump slightly emerged. Kohali appeared to have inverted nipples.

「Come, let’s enter the bath.」

「nnhnmu……」

I soaked myself in the bath first, and then pulled Kohali’s wrist to invite her inside. 

The water’s temperature was just right. I washed away the fatigue that I hadn’t been able to wipe away with a wet towel for around two weeks. 

Kohali was looking like she didn’t know where to soak herself, so I indicated for her to sit between my thighs which I had opened out.

「Umm… Excuse me…」

I intended to have her sit with her back facing me and hug her from behind, but Kohali sat facing me. I looked at her nipples, and they were indeed buried in the areola. A while ago, I had played with her nipples and made them erect, but they were completely back now.

「First, I’ll taste your lovely lips.」

Placing my hand around Kohali’s shoulder blades, I embraced her gently and then kissed her. I knew that her brother was staring here. I indulged myself in Kohali’s lips, again and again, intentionally making kissing sounds to let his brother hear it.

「nnmhmm… brother… mhaw… Ahhhnn, please don’t listen!… nmmwah…mwah…」

Perhaps she was affected by the heat,  drunk from the kiss, or embarrassed by the lewd kissing noises she was making in front of her dear brother, Kohali’s face had visibly started to get redder. Her reaction had further stimulated my lust. I strengthened my hands and then drew closer on her so much that our chests were pushing against each other. The lewd wet noises sounded in the empty courtyard, and it bounced from the walls, echoing clearly.

「Stick out your tongue!」

「nnhnm……mmhhnnn!?」

Sucking her stuck out red tongue, I bit her tongue softly and enjoyed its elasticity. A melting sensation had spread inside my mouth, and as if triggered by it, I felt saliva gather in my mouth. Slightly raising my posture, I pushed all my saliva inside her Kohali’s mouth and made her drink it.

「nnmu……mmphuaa.」

As if unwilling to separate, a string of saliva connected us as our lips parted from each other. Aside from the two of us, another man was watching that erotic scene. Just thinking about it made me hallucinate as if my dick had gotten hotter than the hot bath water.

「Let me touch it.」

I treaded in the hot water and moved behind Kohali.

「Hmm? This is?」

There was something odd placed on the edge of the bathtub. It was a small iron container. It had the same color as the rock, so it was difficult to notice.

「That’s a soap.」

The erect brother quickly explained it. 

I was wondering why they didn’t confiscate it since soaps were high-class goods, but I understood after opening the box. It was already very little from being used. It wouldn’t sell even if the soldiers confiscated it.

As I was looking at the soap, the erect brother approached and squatted on the rock bath’s shade, and then showed a small wooden container.

「Um, If the soap is going to be seized, then how about this one? This was something we got from the city’s public bathhouse, and it’s used up. I think the soldiers probably didn’t know its use, so they didn’t confiscate it. I wasn’t trying to hide it.」

「What’s this?」

Probably because he was afraid that I would accuse them of hiding valuables, he handed it over while trembling. When I opened the cover, there was something blue inside. I couldn’t figure what it was by looking. 

「Its an anti-cold substance…」

「Haven’t heard of it. How do you use it?」

According to him, it was apparently a substance added in the bath during cold days. So it was a bath salt?

When I tried to sniff its scent, it smelled slightly like the fragrance of a flower. In my previous world, I often bought bath salts, so I was interested in it.

「How much do I put in?」

「…It depends on the person’s preference, but I think until the water becomes slightly viscous.」

Viscous?

I placed some of the anti-cold substance on my palm and tried dissolving it in the water.  Just like he said, it turned sticky like a lotion upon dissolving in water. I see. It looked like it could keep the temperature of the hot water. 

I slowly dissolved the substance inside the container in the water. It was interesting to see the blue color dye the clear water.

「……Kohali. Please endure for just a little longer… Forgive your useless brother…」

「Brother…」

While I was absorbed in dissolving the bath salt, the sibling was holding each other’s hand at a close distance while consoling each other. I moved through the bathtub and waved my hand to drive her brother away back to the pillar.

「The water has started to get sticky. This feels great.」

It felt troublesome midway, so I threw the whole container inside the water. As a result, the bathtub had become like a starch paste. When I raised my hand from the water, the water slowly trickled down. The viscosity was amazing.

「Kohali, come here.」

I hugged Kohali’s from behind and rubbed her breasts with the sticky water.

「nmmnm……!」

When I played around her nipples with my finger and rubbed it, a bulge had come out. I pinched and stimulated it.

「Aaahnn! Nooo! nnnmm～!」

Although she was bewildered, her reaction wasn’t bad. I could feel the feeling of her ass in my hand so much that she’d twisted her body, and it was really a nice feeling.

「Ahhh… Ahnmm… Brother… Brother! Ah… Aaah…!」

Kohali grabbed my ankles, and every time I stimulated her, her grip would grow tighter. She looked as if she was desperately trying to endure the pleasant feeling, and I became absorbed in teasing her body.

「How about here?」

「Aaahh! brother! brother!」

As I repeatedly moved aside and returned the hood of her clitoris, Kohali had visibly started bending herself backward.

What an interesting girl.

「Kohali!!!」

I smiled at Kohali’s brother who had been watching us from the pillar’s shade and then rubbed Kohali’s clitoris.

「Brother…! Ahhnn…Ahhn…nnnma, haa, ah, noo, not, there…Aaahhn… Brother, I dont want this!」

I searched for the areas where she was feeling it and focused there. I had no way of knowing how much she was secreting since we were in the bath, but I understood from her sweet moans that she was starting to get intoxicated from the pleasure. 

As if running away from the bathtub, Kohali spread her arms. Her brother was just beyond her hands. Her pose looked like she was seeking help from the sea of pleasure. I didn’t let her and I strengthened the stimulation towards her.

「There?! Ahhhh! Bro, brother! Nooo! Brother!!!」

In the next instant, Kohali—who had been letting out moans like a cry—had collapsed weakly onto me and her hand dropped.

「Ah… noo…」

I kissed Kohali’s face which was covered in her tears and saliva.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 26: Deliciously Eating the Merchant’s Daughter (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As Kohali leaned her body to me, I continued caressing her quietly. The lotion effect of the bath was immense. Pleasure seemed to have taken her senses captive in no time. When I softly whispered to her that her brother was watching us at the side, as if aroused, she’d started to let out lewd moans.

「Kohali…」

I had no idea what was on her brother’s mind when he saw her little sister’s appearance turn into a woman, but he only continued standing on his position. I think he would feel much at ease if he considered it that it was still much better since her sister wasn’t suffering.

「Ahhmn…yahhn…nnmm…haa…」

Kohali’s wet silver hair was stuck on her skin, and her red eyes were moist. Her breathing sometimes rough, and difficult at times. 

Why did I feel so captivated by the anguished appearance of the girl in my arms? I kissed Kohali’s cheek and spoke to her gently.

「Let me hear it, what do you want? Try telling me.」

「nnnmm… hug… hug…」

Kohali’s red unfocused eyes looked at me. She probably wanted a hug. Facing each other, I completely hugged her body.

「I like, hug… brother… brother? your not…? noo…」

It seemed like she was absentminded and mistook me for her brother. I felt kind of disappointed and annoyed, and it made me want to be mean to her.

「What’s the matter? Do you like being hugged by your brother?」

Perhaps embarassased by her mistake, Kohali turned away and avoided my question. I stroked her ass and secret garden with my finger, and then gave a passionate kiss before asking her the question again. After I continued to stimulate her, as if resigned, she answered in an embarassed manner.

「I like it… I feel, relieved…Brother…Aaahh…Don’t listen…Its embarassing…」

「There, there. Let me give you a reward for being honest.」

I continusly stimulated her weak spot, and led her to orgasm. As Kohali’s squeak resounded within the courtyard, I pushed my tongue on her opened lips and savored her taste.

「mmhhmwah… nhmm… mwah, mnnmwahh… ahhnn…」

I moved Kohali, who had lost all her strength, to the edge of the bathtub, and placed both her elbows on the edge.

「Kohali, stand up and turn your ass here.」

「Ah…」

Actually, I had already ejaculated lightly after my dick rubbed on her ass several times while I was touching her all around. There was no way I could endure it when my dick rubbed on her ass after it had become smooth and bouncy due to the lotion-like water. My semen had already mixed with water.

My dick had become erect again, so this time, I wanted to release it inside her. However, perhaps she was afraid to advance to the last act,  Kohali sat still and didn’t raise her body

「Hey, is there a problem?」

When I slid my finger on her secret garden, her body trembled slightly as if she had received an electric shock, and she lifted her body from the bathtub  and her body turned around.

Kohali’s exposed vagina looked eager for a dick, and her hole was opening and closing as if it was breathing. It was an irresistable sight. I pressed my erect dick in her hole.

「I’m going inside, Kohali.」

「Aahh……! I’m scared! I’m really scared…! Brother!! Brother…!」

Kohali stretched both arms, which were placed on the edge of the bathtub, in front. A person’s body could be maintained by hooking their feet on the corner of the bathtub, but since it was slippery due to the lotion-like bath, Kohali was unsteady on her feet, and it looked like she was about to fall down.

 「Kohali!」 

Then, her erect brother rushed over while his dick swayed left and right, and then he grasped Kohali’s hands.

「Please don’t leave me!… stay here, brother…!」

「Don’t worry, Kohali. I’ll stay by your side. Endure it for a little more. Your a good girl, Kohali.」

Despite his erect dick, his words had the same gentle tone when I was seizing their properties earlier. He really looked like he truly cared for her sister. As a fellow brother with a sister, he was a man worthy of respect. Feeling impressed, I decided to allow her brother to stay beside her.

「Then, I’m going in.」

「Ahh……!」

「Hang in there, Kohali!」

As I’d caressed her around to prepare her body, I was able to push my dick inside her vagina smoothly. It seemed like losing her virginity didn’t hurt much, Kohali only let out a small cry.

Kohali’s vagina which was wrapping my dick was tightening so much as if it wanted to squeeze out my semen , seeming as if it was telling that it wanted my sperm.  

I started to slowly pull my dick to start thrusting inside her, but her vagina tightened as though it wanted to keep it inside. I pressed a hand against her clit and kissed her back.

I pulled my dick just outside and thrust it. And then, it entered inside her vagina while generating wet lewd noises. The sound was as though her pussy was swallowing my dick. The lewd noises sounded every time I thrust.

「No…! No…! Don’t listen!……brother… I don’t want this anymore……!」

Ignoring Kohali who was writhing in shame, I continued thrusting my dick. Since I was thrusting from behind her, her breasts would shake every time I pounded her.

「Your breasts are shaking this much, you dirty girl.」

When I tightly held her shaking breasts, my hand slid and her breasts were squeezed between my fingers. I pounded my hips while rubbing her already erect nipples between my fingers.

「Aaahhhn! Ahhnm! Stop! mmmn! Aaahh!」

Kohali looked like she’d begun to feel it. Her vagina had started to warm up, to my surprise. It was probably ready to receive my sperm any time. Her rough breathing and rhythmical moans gently caressed my mind. As if being pulled by her arousal, I felt my semen coming up.

「Ku..! I’m going to cum, Kohali!」

「Eh…!? …… No, you cant! Not inside!」

Ignoring her, I pounded my hips hard and released my semen towards her most sacred place. The first spurt was a large lump of semen which scattered inside her. The 2nd and 3rd spurt didn’t lose to the first and shot inside her vagina like a bullet. My sperm continued rushing out in great momentum, seeking her egg.

When the indescribable sound came out from my throat due to the pleasure of conquering Kohali’s body, she most likely realized that I loosed my semen inside her, and she shook her ass.

「Noo! I’ll get pregnant! Ahhn! Brother help me! Brother! Brother!!! I’ll get..! pregnant…! Brother!」

「Kohali! Kohali! Kohali!!」

My ejaculation lasted long, causing me think that her womb might’ve gotten filled with my semen.

In front of her brother, I continued cumming inside her, as though showing that she was my woman.

|








~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 27: Kohali and Rumon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I learned a useless information. Apparently, the name of Kohali’s erect brother was Rumon.

After I finished releasing my semen inside Kohali, I ordered one of my guards to prepare several commoner’s clothes. Of course, I paid for the clothes. I wouldn’t swipe one from the confiscated properties.

「I’m going to wear this…」

It looked first-class for a commoner’s clothes, but it probably appeared like cheap clothes for Kohali. While surprised, she reluctantly took the clothes. Perhaps Rumon had prepared himself, he gently admonished Kohali, and instead he looked relieved.

In the room, I stood in front of the sibling who were finally wearing a proper clothing, and showed the gold coin held by my guard.

「I’ll pay for Kohali’s dedication. How much do you want?」

There was a large quantity of gold coin inside the bag held by the guard. There was also the payment for the clothes, so I made an idle civil officer bring it. It was my pocket money.

Perhaps Kohali felt ashamed to request money, or maybe she’d remembered herself being violated, she’d started to shake as she remained silent with her head downwards. Rumon had noticed her reaction and tried to speak, but I stopped him with my hand.

「Then let me change the question. Try telling how much gold coin was our intercourse a while ago worth?」

「……Its not, something that can be exchange……with money……」

「So there’s no need for me to pay?」

Eh? Kohali spilled out a surpised voice. She seemed to be thinking that receiving only several commoner’s clothing was insufficient to compensate for her virginity.

「In the case when a commoner young girl has no choice but to sell her virginity, that girl would propose the price to the man. I’m just asking you the price. As a daughter of a merchant, you know the standard price right? Answer as you see fit.」

「……The, standard price? Around a thousand gold coins……?」

Unable to understand what she was saying, I felt dizzy in spite of myself. Rumon looked the same—no, he appeared more shocked and was holding his head.

「A thousand gold coins? Are you referring to the gold coins from the Holy Navenphos? 」

「Eh…? I’m referring to Levios Kingdom’s gold coins, though?」

Simply speaking of gold coins in Levios Kingdom, that would be pointing to the kiris gold coins. Moreover, two kiris gold coins would be enough for a common family in Nyuneri to support themselves for half a year. Probably.

There was no way that a commoner young girl’s virginity would be worth one thousand kiris gold coins. If that was the case, then the commoners would be able to live just by giving birth to a daughter.

「Let me ask you just in case. Are you saying that a person must pay one thousand kiris gold coins to have sex with a young girl in Nambonan?」

「If they don’t have any choice but to sell their body, isn’t that much the average price?」

It seemed that the one thousand gold coins she gave as a price was not for her virginity, but the average price for virginity. She had an unusual sense of money.

「What’s wrong with this girl? Hey, is your family really a merchant? Your sister looks like she’d advise a person to eat cake if they don’t have bread.」

As I looked at her brother, who was also her guardian, he began to explain with lowered head.

Kohali and Rumon’s father had been completely focused on their business and had no time to pay attention to their family. Their mother didn’t recover well after giving birth to Kohali and died, so having no parent he could rely on, Rumon spent his days protecting Kohali.

He appealed to their father and told him to talk to the young Kohali, who was feeling lonely at that time. What came back to him was a bag containing gold coins. His father was implying that they could use it to buy anything they want and not trouble him.

「……Father would sacrifice anything if it meant profit for the business. And because of that, he has a lot of enemy in the business.」

He was famous for using underhanded means to become a nominated council member from being an ordinary peddler, and he also wasn’t liked by the citizens. Worried about Kohali’s safety, Rumon limited her from going outside as much as possible. Whether good or bad, since their father had provided them money, Kohali grew up in a peaceful environment protected by her gentle brother.

「Partly because of that, Kohali is a little ignorant of the world. She can’t continue being like that from now on, though…」

「Brother… I…」

Having explained in front of her just how ignorant she was about the world, tears welled in Kohali’s eyes. Rumon gently stroked her beautiful silver hair and wiped away the tears in her eyes with his finger.

Kohali’s figure seemed to have overlapped with my younger sister Fanny in Nyuneri.

「……What are you planning to do after this? You’ve lost all your properties.」

「I’d like to establish myself in business like my father. I may not look like it, but I’ve trained my skill as a merchant. We wouldn’t be able to start a business here in Nambonan, though.」

「Hm? All you’re properties have been confiscated, but that only applies to the present state of affairs. There shouldn’t be any problem if you want to start your new business here.」

haha, Rumon gave a dry laugh.

「That’s impossible. My father has incurred so much hostility from all over the place that its difficult to believe that he was a council member. If you’ve seen the other council member’s house, wouldn’t you know?」

「I see, you’re right.」

As you could see, there was not a single servant remaining in the mansion. It was only natural since the family head had lost his properties and couldn’t pay them anymore.

Then, did the other council members experience the same thing? No. The elected councilors became a council member by election based on their character and popularity. Most of their servants went and were making an effort for their last service without caring about the pay.

The residents nearby their homes could often be seen preparing food for the family members of the councilors, and some were discussing the places where they could stay. Properties aside, there was no way to confiscate the trust that people had for them.

The five council members who felt relieved upon seeing the contents of our peace agreement were the five elected councilors. They probably knew that the citizens would shield them if they defended Nambonan’s independence.

Even the other nominated councilors, they had also been raising their reputation through public facilities and by hosting festivals. Due to that, quite many people were worried about them and came to their home to check their condition. The nominated council members were formerly merchants, so the complete confiscation of their properties should be the worse outcome for them. It was no wonder they were feeling down.

Only this mansion had been left behind by their servants the moment they were dismissed and also the only one abandoned by the nearby residents. This tells how vicious of a person their father was.

As their father wasn’t included in the list of the executed, he didn’t openly go against Quordentz, but he didn’t seem deserving of sympathy.

「That’s why, I plan to start a business in a new land.」

The eldest son of an upstart family. His first journey to an unfamiliar land. Deceived and bankrupt. …Those words surfaced in my mind.

I didn’t really care if Rumon were to die, but it would be a loss if Kohali were to fall with him. Yet, It somehow didn’t feel right to force Kohali to come to Nyuneri and confine her in a detached house while looking after her. As I was groaning, Rumon politely spoke.

「In Nambonan, the price for the body of a virgin young girl would be around one kiris gold coin. We would be thankful if we could receive a generous price.」

I remember Tesh mention that by giving five kiris gold coins, the citizens would instead feel in debt. Considering that, I concluded that the price that Rumon stated was a fair price. He was quite an honest man. Could he really survive as a merchant with that kind of character?

「Give them five.」

I glanced at my guard and ordered him to provide them with five kiris gold coins. It should be enough for the two of them to survive for a while.

「Thank you for your kindness.」

Rumon lowered down his head towards the man who forced himself on her beloved little sister.

Chapter 28: The Square In Front of the Assembly Hall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The confiscation of the council member’s properties which continued on for several days as well as the arrest, interrogation, and execution of the extremists who had been appealing to resist till the end were almost over.

Grandfather seemed to be doing an excellent job in containing the violent acts and plundering of the soldiers from the Quordentz Allied Army. The commotion within the city had fallen into silence, and the citizens were attentively watching the council’s actions.

The work concerning Nambonan’s surrender was finally entering its final stage.

「And, its about the official announcement of their surrender tomorrow…」

Viscount Galliana spread the city map on the table and pointed at its center.

「It will be held here, the square in front of the assembly hall. The contents will be mostly about the official announcement of their surrender.」

The details concerning Nambonan’s surrender would finally be announced to the citizens tomorrow. Viscount Galliana took several office staff working in the council to my camp for our meeting which covered matters such as the order in which the information would be announced, how much information should be disclosed to the public, and who would appear on stage at what time and their introduction on stage. They seemed to have done the preparations for the program already, and the only thing I had to do was to approve it.

After we’d finished discussing about the announcement, Viscount Galliana spoke as though he remembered something.

「Oh yes, I’ve made a list of Nambonan citizens who may be suitable as an administrative official for the new organization. Please have a look.」

It seemed that this was also included in the agenda, and an office staff immediately arranged wooden boards in front of me. I took a random one.

「The civil officials under the Quordentz are excellent indeed, but we would also need the help of the local people to effectively run things. I suggest employing several of them.」

Viscount Galliana grinned, and he pointed at the wooden board. It had the information and simple background of the citizens. While I looked through the names, I spotted the name of Kohali’s brother among them. As he was the only one I was familiar with, my hand stopped.

「Is there anything wrong?」

Finding my behavior strange, one of the office staff approached.

「No, I’ve just noticed a familiar name.」

There was no need to hide it, so I pointed at the name on the wooden board. Then, the office staff looked like he understood it and began to explain.

「His father has that kind of character, so people often speak ill of him, but Rumon himself is an excellent and honest person. 」

According to him, Rumon wasn’t the type of person to start-up or lead people, but he was knowledgeable when it comes to organizational management. He was apparently quite popular among the office staff in the council, and they were well aware about his hardships due to his father’s bad reputation.

If that assessment was true, considering that Rumon was the successor to his father who had built up their firm in just a single generation, wouldn’t he be a suitable person? Their firm was already gone now, though.

…..

….

…

Next day. 

It was a bright and sunny day, just the perfect weather for today’s official announcement of Nambonan’s surrender. The citizen’s faces were most likely just as blue as this sky.

I was standing by behind the stage which had been set up in the square in front of the assembly hall. The citizens couldn’t see my figure because a partition curtain was hanging down. Nevertheless, I judged that there was a large number of people gathered in the square from the noise coming from beyond the curtain.

「Well then, I will head first. Let’s see each other on the stage later.」

Viscount Galliana smiled, left the partition curtain, and then headed towards the stage. An office staff from the council gave the opening greetings. Afterward, he called the main host—Viscount Galliana—into the stage.

In the next instant, the crowd burst into cheers. Wondering what was going on, I popped my head out of the curtain and saw that Viscount Galliana had just entered the stage. The square was so packed with people that it wouldn’t be strange even if someone were to say that every resident living in Nambonan had gathered here. And such a large crowd all felt overjoyed upon seeing Viscount Galliana.

「He sure is popular.」

「He is Nambonan’s star, after all. Haa, I think he’s a very great person.」

Sitting beside me was Anna, and she let out a breath as if in love. Same as me, she was standing by here waiting for her turn to enter the stage.

「Is that so?」

「Yes. He is Nambonan’s living legend, you know?」

The living legend was silently waiting for the crowd to quiet down. Since his body was massive, he appeared very dignified. 

The square gradually calmed down, and before long, a silent and tense atmosphere filled the place.

After confirming the silence, Viscount Galliana first started by expressing his thanks to Marquis Quordentz. 

Long story short:  

『I’m really thankful for letting me stand in today’s stage in front of my beloved Nambonan! Marquis Quordentz, your the best! Please give me a hug!』

The content was roughly like that.

In the first place, it would’ve normally been impossible for Viscount Galliana to give such a significant performance in Nambonan which had already become a territory under the Quordentz. 

As expected from a former councilor, he was good at speaking, and the citizens were beginning to feel grateful towards Quordentz’s lenient treatment. They were such an easy bunch.

The Viscount informed them about Nambonan’s surrender and explained to them about the matters such as the punishment received by the councilors and the reparations they needed to pay.

They would feel depressed every time they heard bad news, and they stared at Viscount Galliana as if they were seeking salvation.

「…… Because of that, the walls protecting Nambonan will be demolished. The cost for demolishing the walls……」

He continued publicizing the conditions of their surrender. According to the schedule, it would be grandfather’s turn next.

「It’s my turn already?」

As grandfather spoke, he was called by Viscount Galliana. Upon his entrance on stage, the citizens raised an undescribable cry.

「General Garphis will be in charge of Nambonan’s……」

Nambonan was located in the northwesternmost part of Quordentz’s territory. Yet,  the lands around the area were previously controlled by the nobles of the Jinkaen Empire. At present, the Quordentz had been one-sidedly overwhelming the Empire’s nobles, but no one knows when that would last.

In order to solidify this area as a territory under the Quordentz, father decided to construct a solid fort to prepare for the Empire’s counter-offensive. Grandfather would oversee the construction of the fort in the front line with the Empire while maintaining control of the northwest area including Nambonan. Incidentally, Nambonan’s citizens were only told that the commander to defend Nambonan would be General Garphis

「Anyone who rebels against the Quordentz—turn into ashes.」

As grandfather spoke in a low sharp voice, he released maximum output magic from the stage towards the sky. He unleashed the same tide of flame which had turned the mercenaries into ashes in the field.

The crimson spiral—as though a dragon flying towards the heavens—burst and scattered high in the sky.

「Eeek……!」

Upon seeing it, Anna let out a low cry. The citizens in the square felt the same thing. They neither cheered nor screamed, they were only so shocked from seeing such an unbelievable scene as well as fear towards the heat which had pricked their skins. And, they’d immediately realized. What would happen if they were to rebel against the Quordentz.

Seeing that they’d understood it, grandfather went down the stage feeling satisfied. Next would be Anna and my turn. I was feeling slightly nervous.

At this moment, Viscount Galliana finally informed them that Nambonan’s autonomy by the citizens would continue on. The citizens, who were worried about that matter the most, burst into cheers and the square was immediately enveloped in excitement.

Praises filled the square, and just as they’d started to sing his name, Viscount Galliana gestured them to be silent with his palm and spoke.

「I’m not the one deserving of your praise.」

The crowd was taken aback, and confusion spread.

If Viscount Galliana wouldn’t accept it, then who will? That was the question on everyone’s mind.

「The one who saved Nambonan, was a single courageous citizen.」

Then, Viscount Galliana began to talk about the rumors that had become a hot topic within the city. The story was about how the Blue Demon, in his fit of anger, cut down the citizens who tried to rebel. Then the single citizen who stood up and expressed their love for Nambonan to appease the demon’s fury.

「Let’s go.」

「……Yes!」

As Viscount Galliana called our names, Anna and I stood on the stage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 29: Nambonan’s Mayor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Commotion was spreading in the square. 

I leisurely walked towards the stage and wore a solemn expression, and with a serious voice.

「I’m Wilk, Quordentz house’s eldest son.」

I applied magic to transmit my voice throughout the square just like my grandfather did. The fact that I was the eldest son meant that there was a high possibility for me to become the next family head. The citizens also seemed to understand that point, and they quietly waited for my following words.

「Just as I’ve been introduced earlier, I executed the rebels in Nambonan’s bar.」

So it was really true? The citizens could be heard whispering here and there.

「Even after being defeated, Nambonan’s citizens were foolish, still unable to understand Quordentz’s might. I judged that Nambonan City should be destroyed.」

Upon hearing my words, the citizens resented the thoughtless rebel’s actions, and above all, they lamented the fact that they’d made Quordentz’s eldest son angry. A dismal air enveloped the entire square.

「However, there is a single courageous citizen who told me that I was wrong… Come out!」

Without turning back, I waved my hand. 

Anna, in her usual waitress uniform, appeared from inside the curtain and stepped firmly to the side behind me.

The citizens far away from the stage could also see her bar uniform, and they instantly recognized her identity. Her name was being whispered around the square.

「I’m A, Anna!」

Stiffly, Anna continued her introduction. She talked about things such as her job as a waitress in the city’s bar. Perhaps because there was limited entertainment in this world, many people regardless of gender would visit bars. Chatting as they drink alcohol together was one of their precious enjoyments. Having worked in the bar for as long as twenty years, Anna seemed to be well-known among the citizens, and they looked relieved on seeing a person they recognize stand on the stage.

As I was observing, Anna continued speaking nervously, and she’d finally moved to the part about the truth of the rumors. The truth about the rumor was quite an unfortunate event, and it couldn’t even be counted as a story. The fact that a noble was aroused by a waitress’ uniform and raped her was concealed, and she asserted the rumors which had been spreading among the citizens as the truth. 

Viscount Galliana also mentioned that the people were seeking for drama. Besides, that outcome was better for me.

「I have heard from Anna about the difficulties that Nambonan’s citizens have experienced.」

Then, I began recounting Nambonan’s Story of Success. My rehearsal in secret last night was worth the trouble, and I was able to narrate it fluently.

The citizens were so touched that they were trembling upon hearing me recount their history. They were probably thinking that ‘he’s noble there’s no way he’d seriously try to understand about Nambonan.’

Too bad for them, collecting accounts related to history was one of my hobbies.

 「I told my father, Marquis Quordentz, that it would be a pity to destroy Nambonan City.」 

Ohhh! The crowd became overcome with emotion, and they let out cries of joy.

Though in reality, I did not do such thing. There were several plans prepared to be set after seizing control of Nambonan. Retaining the council and the establishment of a higher organization was only one of them.

They were the prepared scenarios so to speak. There was no need for the citizens to know about it, though. I would have them believe that I was a splendid noble who appealed the Marquis to keep their civil government. 

I waved my hand to calm down the excited crowd.

「However, my father has doubts. Can we really trust the citizens who have chosen the council who bared their fangs against the Quordentz and planned to rebel even after being under our control? I believe it was only natural to consider that point.」

The citizens went silent as though they were splashed with cold water.

We won’t rebel! Please believe us!  Such shouts could be heard from far away the stage.

「Therefore, I sought Viscount Galliana’s advice as he is knowledgeable about Nambonan.」

I gave the initiative to Viscount Galliana. Everything was moving forward as planned. I judged that it would be more beneficial if Viscount Galliana was the one to continue on.

Viscount Galliana spoke about a matter which he told them he discussed with me, although in reality, he did not. First, he spoke about the problem in the way the council works.

The ten councilors were all equal in power, and there was no council leader among them. Placing a single person on the top made the citizens remember the former lord who had abandoned them, so it wasn’t supported by the citizens. However, they made such a half-assed decision precisely because of that equality. As a result, they easily fell. An egalitarian organization without a leader might be good in times of peace, but it was fragile when in war. 

 Viscount Galliana explained these things to the citizens in an easy to understand manner.

「Nambonan needs a leader with a greater authority.」

There were some citizens who raised their hands in agreement with Viscount Galliana’s conclusion. They were the hired people. The hired people among the crowd each voiced their dissatisfaction towards the council’s indecisiveness, and they shouted that they need a reliable leader. Naturally, the soldiers who were secretly associated with the Quordentz family and the city guards didn’t try to stop them. Gradually, there were more and more citizens who voiced their support, much more than the number of hired people.

「A leader who knows about Nambonan’s history, and understands civil government, and is trusted by the Quordentz.」

Then, Viscount Galliana paused.

A strange silence enveloped the square for a moment.

All eyes then gathered on me as I stood on the stage. I understood that I was in the spotlight.

「I only know one person.」

Silence fell over the square, and the noise vanished as though time had stopped.

Who is the leader? The citizens were all keen to hear Viscount Galliana’s answer.

「I ask you, Nambonan’s citizens. Who is worthy to be Nambonan’s representative—the Mayor?」

Viscount Galliana didn’t reveal the name.

「It’s Wilk-sama!」

「There’s no one other than Wilk-sama!」

I didn’t know if it was the hired people or the citizens, but just as we’d planned, there was someone who shouted. Then, the shouts gradually grew louder, and it continuously spread to the whole square. Anna lowered her head and was enduring the loud shouting coming from the crowd. Her trembling appearance was cute.

Mayor! Mayor! The crowd shouted my name and chanted mayor.

I somehow pictured the image of a young bird seeking food from its parent bird. The citizens might be the young bird which opened its mouth, seeking for the food known as comfort.

I raised my palm up, and then slowly lowered it. 

All the citizen closed their mouths and sharpened their ears.

Slowly opening my mouth, I spoke aloud to the citizens.

「At the citizen’s request, I promise to become Nambonan’s mayor.」

Cheers and loud applauses enveloped the square. Joyful smiles spread among the citizens, and they clapped their hands high up.

On this day, amidst the thunderous applause, Nambonan’s democracy came to an end.

「Ah, it has ended without a hitch. It is well said that people lose their judgement as they increase in number.」

The official announcement of the surrender had ended, and we were holding an evaluation meeting at Viscount Galliana’s tent. As everything had gone according to plan, Viscount Galliana was all smiles.

「In the end, how are things any different from being ruled by a noble?」

Nambonan’s mayor possessed great authority. It had the power to do anything, just like the Enabling Act of 1933.[1] Honestly, it was a cheat position. Moreover, only members of the House of Quordentz could sit on the position of mayor. What was democracy all along?

「Possessing authority is one thing, employing it is another. By pretending on leaving everything to their hands, wouldn’t people view Wilk-dono as an understanding mayor?」

「You have a point.」

Nambonan was originally semi-independent, so it should be enough to just watch over them to make sure things don’t advance in a weird direction. A civil officer would be transferred from the Quordentz to build a new city hall and supervise Nambonan’s council, so the only thing left for me was to approve things. In Quordentz territory, Nambonan wasn’t comparable to Nyuneri, but its development was among the top three, so it wouldn’t be too bad to visit once in a while for inspection.

As though his work was finally over, Viscount Galliana sat deeply on the chair and held the goblet filled with alcohol.

「At any rate, It was the best outcome for Nambonan.」

「Is that so?」

I didn’t think so, but according to my father and Viscount Galliana, it was apparently much better compared to the original plan.

「I sensed it last time, too… Wilk-dono has a good understanding of civil government.」

I was a former Japanese, so I was still a commoner deep down. I was growing quite close to a noble, though. It seemed like Viscount Galliana had considered me as a person who likes commoners since I’d been bringing my newly developed goods to him and I’d been talking with him a lot about Nambonan’s government.

I do like the commoners. After all, I was permitted to rape them.

「They’ll be absorbed peacefully into the territory of Quordentz without causing any serious changes on their lifestyles. Furthermore, the invincible General Garphis would be protecting the city, and Quordentz family’s next head Wilk-dono who understands about civil government will take the post of the mayor. And, the citizens are all happy to accept it. What is there to complain about?」

「If you say it like that, there’s none.」

「According to the original plan, we would take everything from the citizens after we’d taken control of the city. The rich would have their properties seized, and anyone with limbs would be reduced to slave and do slave labor. Even if we were to massacre a city with only commoners, no one would complain.」

「I see. It’s just as Viscount Galliana said. It is indeed the best outcome.」

At the very least, I would never think of reducing the city to ashes unless something really serious happens. I also didn’t intend to rampage about as I please as a dictator in Nambonan.

If I were to do anything careless and cause Nambonan to collapse, my father who had been preparing to build a fortress in this area would give up on me and I’d be stripped of my status as the next Marquis.

「Absolutely. Isn’t it also good for Wilk-dono? It would be an achievement to have real experience in managing a territory. Besides…」

「Besides?」

Then, Viscount Galliana made a sound with his throat and grinned. His voice suggested that the serious discussion was over.

「Wilk-dono must be excited for tonight.」    

「Hahaha.」

He was probably talking about Anna. I laughed it away.

I could never say that I felt horny on seeing Anna’s flushed face on the way from the square, and I went to her house and soaked her with four shots.

Chapter 30: Sightseeing in the Border
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


「Mayor, please be careful.」

「Please have a safe trip.」

Rumon lowered his head. Following him, Kohali lowered her head, and her silver hair gently hung down. 

「I leave things to you while I’m away.」

After I talked to the sibling, I left the mayor’s office.

Two days had passed since the announcement. Although there were slight troubles, Nambonan was moving well under the new structure.

I decided to establish Rumon and Kohali’s former mansion, which was among the confiscated residences from the councilors, as the new city hall. It had a splendid appearance, and its location was also good. Above all, there was a bath, which became the deciding factor. A better building might get constructed in the future, but the mansion would serve as the mayor’s mansion and the city hall for the time being.

Although called a city hall, its main task was to observe and supervise the council. It was unlike the city hall in my previous world that would perform tasks such as accepting marriage applications, issuing residence certificates, and going around the populace. Hence, there were only a few staffs. It was a small organization with about thirty people; around twenty civil officers transferred from Quordentz house and about ten commoner staffs hired from Nambonan City. 

Moreover, those city staffs were working at Nambonan Castle, the council’s office. Hence there was only a small number of people left in this mansion. Many of the citizens appeared to be unaware that this mansion also served as the city hall, and they were calling it the mayor’s mansion.

I hired Rumon as city staff. I didn’t think he would succeed in starting a business, but I thought that he was suitable as an official, based on the evaluation I heard from the council’s staff. When I sent an invitation to hire him while they were doing their preparation to leave Nambonan, he surprisingly accepted it. As expected, Rumon most likely considered that it was unrealistic and difficult to travel to a faraway land with a sheltered girl like Kohali.

If I hired Rumon, Kohali would also follow him. This could be considered a package deal or a value set depending on the person. I loved Kohali’s gentle smile when she was together with her brother, so I took it as a good deal. I arranged and lent a room similar to a storehouse in the mayor’s mansion to the miserable sibling since they had no place to stay. Kohali had been hired to do odd jobs in the mansion, but as expected, she was having a problem in working since she lacked in common sense. 

These two weeks had been hectic because of the preparations for the new council election, so I hadn’t been able to have sex with Kohali even once. She was included in my package deal, so what was going on here? 

Ever since the announcement, I felt that Anna had become friendlier to me. One more step, I believe she’d become madly in love. I had no clue how long that one step would take, though. Maybe I should lavish her with honeyed words the next time we have sex, I thought.

「Young Master, the preparations are done. We can leave at any time.」

「I see.」

Nambonan City had become quite stable, so it had been decided that I would temporarily return to Nyuneri to report the situation to my father. I intended to return after sightseeing at the border with the empire together with my grandfather.

「Grandfather, let’s go.」

I lined my horse with my grandfather, who had been waiting on his horse, and advanced through the city. The citizens were aware that I would be returning to Nyuneri and they were looking at us with curiosity. When I lightly waved my hand, they shouted in joy. My popularity as Nambonan’s mayor seemed to be going strong. Good.

The walls had already been demolished to some extent, but the area around the gate hadn’t yet. The gatekeeper saluted with a smile, and I told him to do his best in protecting the citizens.

「Grandfather, what are you going to do after you arrive at the base?」 

「Hm? I plan to go around beating the asses of those slaves while I monitor the progress of the fort.」 

The other nobles in the Quordentz Allied Army had captured the routed mercenaries and turned them into slaves. The Quordentz house had bought the slaves on the spot for a low price. As it would be time-consuming to take the group of former mercenaries to their territories, selling them for a reasonable price was easier. The slaves were making an effort in constructing the fort in the defense base, which was our current place of destination this time.  

 「…… If we don’t fortify the base, we won’t be able to move.」 

Although grandfather was the former head, he must follow the orders from my father, who was the current head of our family. Grandfather looked like he wanted to go and raise a bloodbath out of those nobles who he hated so much, but he was apparently going to endure until his task was over. I could see that grandfather was itching to fight. As he wanted to finish the construction and continue the war as early as possible, the slaves would probably be yelled at as they do their work. It would be tough for them.

Quordentz’s territory was located between the Levios Kingdom and Jinkaen Empire. It was located west of Levious Kingdom, while it was in the east of Jinkaen Empire. Due to that, Quordentz’s territory would expand westwards whenever grandfather attacked and seized the lands from the Empire’s nobles. It would be great if the territory expanded in desirable shape, but that wasn’t the case. The territory had become like a boomerang in shape. Conquering the area including Nambonan had stretched the border between Quordentz’s territory and the Empire sideways. Preparing a defense structure was inevitable for a stable war in the future.

We’d traveled around one day to the west of Nambonan, and we were getting farther away from Nyuneri. The terrain around this area was rugged due to the mountain ranges.

This place, which could be described as a mountainous region, a valley, or even a place along a mountain, was the foremost defense base against the Empire. There was a river tributary to a larger one flowing, and it was considered the boundary line between Quordentz’s territory and the territory of the nobles from the Jinkaen Empire. In short, that was the boundary between the Levious Kingdom and the Jinkaen Empire.

「So that’s the Empire’s defense base?」

As I looked at the distant opposite shore, army facilities were set up around the area, but there were several areas concealed by the wall so I couldn’t grasp the number of soldiers inside. According to my grandfather, there weren’t enough soldiers for them to launch an invasion, but there was enough to defend against our attack.

On the riverbank of Quordentz’s territory, soldier and slaves were quietly doing public works. Glancing at the surroundings, unique stones that could repel magic were neatly arrayed in the area which looked like a material storehouse. Those were the stones we collected when we demolished the walls in Nambonan, and they were brought all the way here. What my father desired the most in Nambonan City was actually this stone that could repel magic—Magic Severing Stone. Even in Nyuneri City, the darkish eerie stone with an oppressive aura was the stone used in the walls which divided the castle town and the urban area. Although called stone, it was practically a material similar to clay, and they wouldn’t easily break when struck.

Manufacturing these Magic Severing Stone takes a lot of time, so it was difficult to make up the number. It wasn’t something we could immediately prepare. When my father discovered that they were used in the walls of Nambonan City, he apparently thought of putting them into use in the foremost defense base. Still, Nambonan City’s business power was astonishing for being able to prepare this much stone. The fact that they spent them to build the walls without sparing shows how much they really feared the nobles.

「It hasn’t been long since the construction began, but it looks like thing are progressing well.」 

「Well, the soldiers probably want to finish this kind of work as quickly as possible, too.」

When grandfather said those words while looking at the officer-class soldiers, each one of them vehemently nodded their head. I thought public works were boring, but that wasn’t the case here. Apparently, they couldn’t wait to restart the war with Empire’s nobles.

「Nambonan was Young Master’s first campaign, so its no wonder that Young Master doesn’t know. Normally, the captured city would be in a more terrible state. For us ordinary soldiers, that’s where we would reap our rewards.」

Simply put, plundering was allowed to some extent. Since we intended to maintain the structure in Nambonan, grandfather strictly prohibited the soldiers from the plundering acts. 



I see. Then it was mostly like a dull war for the ordinary soldiers. 



「We weren’t able to do anything in the war at Nambonan, so its only natural. We’ve practically won with just Young Master and the General’s magic. And, we only hunted the remnants.」 

Another officer-looking soldier said as to rebuke the soldier who grumbled.  Grandfather seemed to agree, so I quietly agreed.  

「Do your best. The next war is nearing.」

Life was tough for the Empire’s nobles, too.

After we finished observing the border and the defense base, I went on my way back to Nambonan. Grandfather would serve as the chief overseer in the construction, so we separated at the base.

I returned to Nambonan in a day, and once again immediately departed for Nyuneri after preparing the supplies such as foods.

「Where did Young Master go when we returned to Nambonan earlier?」

 「Ah, I thought of buying Nambonan’s specialty product as a souvenir, but they weren’t selling anything good.」 

  「A souvenir, is it? 」  

It would make you want to buy a souvenir when you go sightseeing. I would’ve bought it instantly if there was a dragon on sword keychain, a wooden figure of a bear, or a wooden board with a ‘Friendship, Effort, and Victory’ written on it. Unfortunately, there was none. Well, Fanny would probably just feel confused if I gave her such thing. But since I went to Nambonan, I wanted to at least return with some kind of local specialty.

 「I heard that there might be something good in a village on the way back. It shouldn’t take long, can we drop by there? 」 

I passed this area’s map which I received from Rumon to my adjutant and asked him if we could drop by the village. The village wasn’t that far off our route, so I think it should be fine.

「There’s not much danger around this area, so I think there shouldn’t be any problem.」

And so, we’d slightly changed our course.

Chapter 31: Deliciously Eating the Village Girl (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I plucked the leaves carefully, so as to not break the branch. Even the leaves which hadn’t been dried yet would leave its fragrance on the fingers if I pluck this much. I love this fragrance.

「Sokola, let’s take a short break?」

Turning around, Rafen was there. I involuntarily broke into a smile.

「Okay!」

I placed the basket with the leaves on the base of a tree and rushed on Rafen’s side. Shyly, he slightly turned his face away and extended his hand to me. He seemed to be telling me to hold hands. I felt happy and held his hand. His hand, which had matured into a grown-up man’s hand, was reliable and gentle, and I loved it so much.

「Hey, Rafen. Since the weather is good, let’s drink tea outside. What do you say?」

「Sounds good. I like the tea you make.」

「Really?」

「Yes, really.」

I felt slightly nervous upon hearing his words. I wanted to make a delicious tea. 

I returned to my house and picked the best tea leaves. Although I said best tea leaves, the villagers could only drink the tea leaves that wouldn’t sell. I picked and gathered the pieces of  dried petal that was seldom mixed among the tea leaves. 

I’d only been able to drink a tea made from high-quality tea leaves a few times. It somehow felt strange. Even though these were the tea leaves that we’d worked hard to raise from a seedling before being gathered, dried, and sold…

Back when I drank the tea made from tea leaves which they said were the highest-quality during my sister’s marriage celebration, I was moved by its especially rich fragrance and its golden color like the morning sun lighting the clouds. I still remembered that I wanted to enjoy this tea again.

I carried the teawares and tea leaves which I’d worked hard to pick, and told my young brother to boil water before going to the garden where Rafen was waiting.

「Rafen. I wonder when can we get married?」

「Soon enough, I’m sure. The villagers have decreased due to the war in Nambonan.」

「Ah, your right.」

Several grown-ups in the neighborhood had joined the war in Nambonan. A messenger came all the way here to our farm village to recruit soldiers. Nambonan was a rich city, and the payment was apparently good. Several grown-ups in the village participated, and most never came back. Those who had returned, they were in a grave condition. Some had lost an arm, while some had suffered burns.

I was really glad the Rafen didn’t join. I hadn’t told that to anyone, though.

「Things have already become difficult in the village since Uncle Beard died, and now the villagers have decreased. Wouldn’t they hurry us to marry and give birth to a baby?」

「B, b, baby…」

My body could already give birth to a child since last year. That was why I could get married anytime. If I could give birth to Rafen’s child, I’d very much like to get married as soon as possible.

According to what I’d heard from mom and my older sister, it seemed like I would be put in a very embarrassing appearance. But it was fine if my partner was Rafen, yes. But, precisely because it was with Rafen, I might feel more embarrassed.

「Ah, well, no. I didn’t mean it the weird way.」

Rafen hurriedly denied his words while blushing. I felt like I wanted to tease him for a bit.

「Eh? You don’t want to marry me?」

「I, I didn’t say anything like that!」

Rafen suddenly stood up, and then he tightly held my hand. It was slightly painful.

「I’m really happy that they allowed our marriage.」

「Hmm?」

I’m happy, too! I wouldn’t tell him that yet. I still wanted to hear more from him.

「I’ve always, always liked you since we were a child, Sokola.」

We’d already expressed our feelings for each other many times over, but I was still very happy to hear him say that he loved me. I was very happy.

「I also like you.」

Rafen held my hand, and I held his hand tightly. 

He was hardworking, gentle, and he was always watching me. I loved Rafen.

「Hey, Rafen. What do you like about me? Can you tell me?」

「Everything about you. Your cheerful personality and the way your sweet towards me. The delicious tea you make, and also your blue hair and eyes that resemble the blue sky during spring.」 

Gently, Rafen brushed my hair with his hand, and his other hand caressed my cheek. Ahh, it felt so good. Being touched by gave my heart a warm feeling, and I liked it.

「Sokola……」

「……Rafen.」

I noticed that our faces were getting closer to each other. I hope my younger brother wasn’t nearby.

chu 

I felt like I heard that sound.

「Rafen… we shouldn’t. We still haven’t gotten married yet.」

「Sorry, Sokola. But, I really like you.」

He held my hands tightly, but I placed strength on my shoulders and resisted him. I was still scared, and my older sister also told me that we couldn’t do that thing yet without getting married.

「No. You can’t, okay? We would be married soon. Can’t you wait until then?」

「Sokola……」

Seeing his guild-ridden sad face, I felt a pain in my chest. I checked if my family was nearby, and then kissed him. I could feel warmth inside my body as though I’d gulped a tea. 

Was this the fourth kiss?

I wanted to continue on. But, endure it, endure it.

chu 

This was the 5th kiss. If we don’t end this soon, Rafen and I wouldn’t be able to stop anymore. But really, it felt good…

「Noo, Rafe,n……」

「Sokolaa……」

I somehow separated myself from Rafen and stood up. The water should be boiling by now.

「Let’s go and drink tea. I’ll make a delicious tea for you.」

I did my best to move my trembling legs and returned to my house.

Night.

My mom took me to the village chief’s house. I had no clue why, and we were only told to gather there.

「I’m glad that you came. So everyone’s here?」

When I looked around, most of the young girls in the village were gathered here, including my married sister. The only ones absent were the little girls and the grannies.

「Sokola, can your body give birth to a child already?」

「Eh…」

「Yes. She’s planned to marry our neighboring house’s Rafen.」

The one who replied was my mom. Even though he was already an old man, I felt disgusted being asked about my body.

「Fmm… Everyone, I’m glad you gathered here this late at night.」

What was this all about? The village chief had never called us to gather at his house during the night.

「A while ago, a noble came to our village. I heard the noble came here to buy good tea leaves.」

Everyone looked at each other, wondering how to reply. If he came to buy tea leaves, then shouldn’t you just sell him the leaves? Since he was a noble, he must be rich.

「The noble was very happy when I showed the tea leaves stocked in our village. I was able to receive a large payment, too. It was really a great help.」

The fact that the tea leaves that we’d worked hard to raise was liked by a noble made me feel like my job had been approved and I felt happy. The village chief seemed to be joyous about the payment, but I didn’t really care since it wasn’t my money.

「That noble will be staying here for tonight and leave tomorrow.」

「…… That noble, is he a male?」

My mom interjected. 

 Indeed the village chief nodded his head.

「You probably don’t know him, but that noble is the eldest son of the House of Quordentz. He’s a very influential noble……」

Even if you tell us that, I didn’t know the difference between nobles. A noble was a noble.

However, only me and other girls around my age thought like that.Mom’s eyes had become serious. Above all, the village chief’s expression was so serious that it was frightening.

「We can’t let this chance escape. No matter what, you must receive his seed…!」

Mom and the other older women explained the matter to us, as we didn’t have any clue. 

Apparently, if you were to receive, that… seed from a noble, a child possessing a magic power would be born. People with magic power were very strong. Their body wouldn’t catch a cold, and their strength was several times that of an ordinary person. They could easily plow the fields and repel a pack of wolves alone. Some could heal illnesses with magic, while some could let out flames that could burn fields.

There was one person with magic power in this village in the past. It was Uncle Beard. He could unleash a flame that could burn down as many as three large trees. He also fought thieves several times, so people in the village respected him very much. I still remembered that the village was enveloped in a depressed atmosphere when he died of illness two years ago.

Currently, there was no one in the village with magic power.

「I will be taking you all in front of the noble now. No matter what, you must receive his seed! You must get pregnant with a child, a child with magic power!」

There was a talk about how Uncle Beard’s mom received a seed from a noble who had arrived in our village by chance. The village chief wanted us to do the same thing.

I didn’t want to do it, but I couldn’t disobey the village chief. If I did, it would cause trouble for my family, including my mom, dad, old sister, and even my younger brother.

But, I didn’t want to do it. I wanted to give birth to Rafen’s child. I wanted the child of the man I love and not a child with magic power.

「Um, can’t we first leave the unmarried girls behind…?」

My mom asked the village chief.

「I agree. We’ll go in front of the noble first. If he liked any of us, we won’t need to send any of the girls.」

A mother of another girl said. 

They were protecting us.

「But, the noble was only ten, eleven, or twelve years old at most from his appearance. How old are you now?」

「Twenty five.」

My mother answered.

「10 and 25, that’s already mother and child. I’m not sure if he would take a liking… It would be best to send the young girls first, rather than carelessly sending someone and receive his displeasure.」

No one could object. The village chief had already decided to send the young girls. There was no villager who could go against his decision.

No! 

Rafen, help me! 

「We should show him the beautiful girls. Let’s see. Mauve, Nasha, Keiha, and… Sokola. Go and clean your body at once, and then gather here again.」

If I knew this would happen, I shouldn’t have resisted him.

Rafen…

It was after the village chief had left and my mother patted my head that I noticed the tears falling down to my chin.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 32: Deliciously Eating the Village Girl (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


My mom brought me back to our house, wiped my body with a wet towel, and had me wear an especially beautiful dress. As she was combing my hair, I remembered the day when my older sister married.

Why did things turn out this way? I never imagined that the day my mom would dress me with such a sad feeling would come. Tears fell down, and the teardrops ruined my makeup. Every time, Mom would fix my makeup while apologizing to me. After the same thing repeated a couple of times, I realized that there was no escaping my situation.

「I’m sorry, Sokola. I wish we could’ve shown ourselves first in front of the noble, but…」

「There’s nothing we can do, Mom.」

There was no way that was true! But, nothing would change even if I told her that.

「Oh, you look beautiful.」

Mom said as she displayed a proud smile. I wished I didn’t look beautiful so that the noble wouldn’t notice me. I wanted to roll over the fields and get myself covered in mud.

「……Sokola. Listen to your mother.」

「What?」

「You can tell the villagers how much you hate it, and you can even voice your dissatisfaction, but… You must never ever show that kind of attitude when the noble speaks to you.」

Mom said as though she was warning about my inattentive attitude. She tightly held my shoulders, and it felt painful.

「If you make him angry, he could easily destroy our village. If you were to make a mistake, even if he doesn’t go as far as destroying our village, he might kill your mom and the others, and even your fiancé Rafen.」

「No way…」

If left with no other choice, I considered telling the noble that I already had a fiancé and then beg him to let me off. But, I never imagined that it would be a huge mistake and it might even involve Rafen. That thought sent chills down my spine, and I felt my chest tighten.

「That’s why, Sokola, you can be angry to your mom as much as you like. You can even tell the village chief that you hate him. But, never ever show that kind of behavior in front of the noble. I want you to at least promise that to your mom.」

「Mom…」

I jumped on my mom’s chest and cried. I wished mom would never finish fixing my makeup.

When we returned to the village chief’s house, Mauve, Nasha, and Keiha were already there waiting. I was the last to return.

「Your slow.」

「I’m sorry. She’s finished preparing herself.」

Mom lowered her head, but I wouldn’t lower mine.

「Be respectful to the noble. Understand?」

「Yes.」

I made a promise with my mom, so I would keep my word. I hated it, but there was nothing I could do. In order to live in the village, I couldn’t run away on my own.

We left the room with the village chief in front. The noble was apparently staying at the village’s meeting place.

As I walked, I was fantasizing that Rafen would come to my aid. He would come here after hearing about my situation and take my hand away from the village. After being lucky enough to escape, we would build a happy family in a far-off land, together with each other. Then, we would have kids, and our family of two would have a new member.

「Everyone, keep quiet. I will go and talk to the noble of the matter about woman.」

My blissful fantasy instantly crumbled and disappeared along with the village chief’s words.

When I noticed it, we’d already entered inside the meeting place building. We were placed inside a small room, and the village chief went off to the inner room.

「Hey, what does everyone think?」

I was unable to endure the strange silence and spoke.

Stay quiet Mauve sent me that kind of look, but I was really curious about their thoughts.

「I, I’m fine with it… Sokola doesn’t seem to agree, though.」

「I don’t mind sleeping with a noble.」

Keiha and Nasha spoke. 

Their answers were completely different from what I had imagined.

「You’ve heard about it, right? My father and even my brother died in the war in Nambonan. My family would end up selling my little sister at this rate. But, the village chief said that he would take care of us if I become pregnant with the noble’s child. That’s why I’m glad to be here.」 

I knew about Keiha’s difficult family circumstances, but it seemed like they were really in a tough situation. She was probably not the only girl who thought the same. There might be many who would like to come here for the same reason. I wanted to change places with them…

「I, I want someone with magic power in the village. I’ve already given birth to a child, so there’s no problem even if give birth to another one. I want a kind and strong boy, like Uncle Beard. I don’t want to pass my days while worrying about the thieves and wolves anymore.」

Nasha had gotten married the year before the last, and she’d already given birth to a boy. I admired them for being an intimate couple, and yet… I somehow felt like my opinion of her was changing. Sleeping with a man other than your beloved, had it become such a trivial matter?

「How about you, Mauve?」

「Don’t talk.」

Mauve said irritatingly.

As I continued looking at her, she let out a short breath, and while annoyed she spoke.

「I’m married, yes, but it’s not like I married that man because I like him. My parents decided it on their own. Rather than sleeping with a man I don’t like, doing it with a noble is much better since I would be able to give birth to a child with magic power.」

Mauve was a newlywed, but their husband and wife relationship wasn’t good. They were always fighting. There was a rumor amongst the young girls that Mauve was in love with a man from another village. That was why there was a huge commotion back when her parents forced her to marry a man in our village.

「If I become pregnant with the noble’s child, I wouldn’t have to sleep with that man until I give birth. Perhaps the noble might even take me away from here if he took a liking to me. It’s the perfect chance to leave this awful village.」

After she uttered that with contempt, Mauve kept silent. 

She must be thinking about the boy from another village. If that was the case, then I’m sure she also didn’t want to sleep with that noble. I’m sure that was the case, that was what I wanted to believe.

「I’ve somehow managed to obtain his permission. Start preparing, everyone. We’ll enter the room.」

Seeing the village chief showed up in a hurry, I closed my eyes and calmed my heart.

Please don’t pick me.

Please don’t pick me.

Please don’t pick me.

Rafen…..

As the door to the large meeting room opened, the room was bright. A strange round thing similar to the moon was hovering and illuminating the room.

Surrounded by the knights, a boy around my age was sitting. His clothing was brimming with embroidery,  a sturdy-looking leather boots, a mantle which obviously looked expensive, and flawless skin as well as a beautiful blue hair. He was playing with a beautiful gemstone, without even bothering to look at us. He seemed to be telling that commoners like us weren’t worthy of his glance.

….. So this was a noble.

「Sokola…! What are you doing! Your impolite!」

Everyone was already kneeling on the floor.

I hurriedly kneeled.

The village chief immediately apologized for my impoliteness and took a deep apologizing posture.

「You shall be forgiven.」

「Yes!」

He forgave the village chief and my impolite behavior without really looking at us. I was glad.

「So, um, these are the girl’s I have mentioned earlier…」

「I don’t need a woman. Leave.」

He said as though the village chief was nothing in his eyes. He didn’t even glance at him. His tone gave me the shivers, and I felt like I understood why Mom feared nobles.

The village chief stammered, and he looked like he was trying to think of a way. I only remained silent.

「Then, how about a tea…? The girls in the village can make a delicious tea.」

The noble revealed a slight reaction as he remained silent, and he turned his eyes to the village chief. That reminds me, he came to this village to buy tea leaves. Perhaps he might lose his interest in us if he could enjoy a tea.

「Hm?」

His gaze moved from the village chief towards my direction, and then he looked at me, and our eyes somehow met each other. Thinking that it would be rude to avert my eyes, I stayed still. I felt like he was observing me.

「That girl.」

「She’s named Sokola. I wonder if she’s to your liking? If I could have the permission, I’ll have her prepare a tea…?」

The village chief took the opportunity and began to sell me.

I’m scared! I’m scared! I’m scared!

He was younger than Rafen, but why was he so scary? I felt like my back was drenched.

「I don’t need a tea.」

Hearing his words, I patted my chest in relief. However, his words didn’t end there.

「Leave that girl behind, and get out.」

I blanked out. 

Unconsciously, my hands were wandering about, seeking help. But, Rafen wasn’t here to gently hold my hands.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 33: Deliciously Eating the Village Girl (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The village chief, Mauve, Nasha, and Keiha all left the room. I was standing alone in front of the noble. My legs were shaking so much that I could fall over at any moment.

「All of you, guard the surroundings of the building. I’ll ring the bell once its over.」

「Yes.」

Then, the soldiers left the room one after another. The noble and I were finally the only ones remaining in the room.

Other than Rafen, I’d never been alone together with a boy. I was scared…

「What’s the matter? Didn’t you come to sleep with me?」

「Y, yes…」

I took a step forward, and almost fell over. My legs were shaky, chest painful as though it was being squeezed, and tears almost spilling out.

Not good! I mustn’t cry here now, or else it would trouble everyone. They might even do something to Rafen.

「Let me see your eyes.」

「Eh?」

As I was told not to move, I stood still. Then, the noble’s face came closer. Thinking that he would kiss me, I immediately turned my face away.

「Hey, don’t turn away.」

He caught my head, and looked into my eyes. I also looked at his, and I couldnt read any emotions from his silver colored eyes.

「Blue hair, blue eyes…」

For an instant, his eyes laughed as though a cat finding its prey.

My body trembled. What was thing feeling?

「It would’ve been perfect if she’s wearing Kohali’s dress, but… I didn’t bring it here.」

He was mumbling something. I wanted to escape right now, but I couldn’t run away.

He was really scary. I’d vaguely felt a power when I was near Uncle Beard, but this noble’s magic power felt much denser.

「Well, its fine. Let’s just enjoy it as it is. Come here, Fa—no, what’s your name?」

「S, Sokola. 」

There was no way I could escape. I gave him my name.

The noble quickly moved closer and hugged me.

No!

I didn’t like this feeling on my body as it wasn’t coming from Rafen’s hands.

「Ah……」

His hands wrapped around my back and waist and pulled my body closer. I already had an idea what was going to happen next. After all, I’d already experienced it five times, and I thought the sixth time would also be with Rafen.

chu.

A completely different feeling was sent from my lips, and It gave me goosebumps.

No! No! No!

「This is good.」

He placed power on his arm that was once again wrapped around my back.

chu

The seventh kiss didn’t end so simple.

「Mmhmukuu!?」

Something slimy was moving, tracing my lips. That slimy thing pried open my mouth, entered inside and touched my tongue.

「mnhhhmuuuー?!」

I tried to step back, but I couldn’t move because his hands were holding my head. He continuously violated my mouth as though he was savoring it before releasing my lips. This was something I’d never experienced with Rafen.

Disgusting.

「This time, you stick your tongue out and slide it inside my mouth.」

「….. Yes…」

I couldn’t resist him.

I matched our lips and stuck out my tongue into his mouth. I felt so disgusted, sad, and unwilling. But I didn’t have any choice. When my tongue reached inside his mouth, it was sucked and pulled deeper inside.

「nnhmuu…mmwah…mmwah」

Sounds of kissing echoed inside the room, and every time those sounds stabbed my ears, I would become aware of what I was doing, and I’d feel very sad. Why did I have to do this thing? Not good, I would only cry if I were to think about it.

「—pfaa……nmm!」

He released my lips for a moment before sucking it again. As my body lost its strength due to fear, I leaned my body on him, and he hugged me. At his mercy, we kissed, tongues entwined against each other, and exchanged saliva.

「nnnhmwah……! nnma……mwah….mwah……haaann……ahhn……」

How many times had it been? I’d been kissed so much that I didn’t bother counting it anymore. Unlike the gentle touch of Rafen’s lips, he was kissing with his tongue. Even though it felt disgusting, I hated myself for becoming used to this feeling. It felt like he was spitting at the memories I had with Rafen.

My head and hair were gently caressed. The way he touched somehow felt like it was filled with tender love. I could feel a warmth, as though he was caressing an irreplaceable and important person. I closed my eyes while responding to his kiss. I had an image as though the person kissing me was Rafen. If he was really this person, there wouldn’t be anything more pleasant.

「Raー…fen.」

My mind had started to become hazy, and I was starting to forget who was the person kissing me. I felt like it would be much better if I didn’t know who was kissing me. When I noticed it, I was already facing up on the bed while being kissed.

「I’m going to remove your clothes.」

「Ah……ah.」

He touched my dress without waiting for my reply. I felt frightened every time a string was unfastened, and it felt as though my heart was being revealed. My body, which I hadn’t shown even to Rafen, would be seen by an unfamiliar man. When there were only a few clothes covering my body, he kissed my forehead. Confirming that my attention was focused on my forehead, with smooth coordination, he took off the clothing covering my lower body. My lower body had become completely bare.

「Ah! No!!」

I reflexively raised my upper body and covered my private area. Then the noble moved around my back and hugged me from behind. I almost let out a scream when he lightly bit on my ear. I felt a chill on the side of my body where he bit my ear, and I trembled.

「N, Noo!!! Down there, no!」

His other hand slid into my private area, and his fingers brushed the place which I hadn’t even shown anyone. With his finger on my private area, he went around from my shoulder and kissed me.

「Nnnnー!」

His hand gradually went deeper and slid into my private area. There was a ticklish feeling, and I felt disgusted by it, as though there was a lump of something sickening turning around between my chest and stomach.

「Hm? This is…」

My legs were spread out wide, and my part down there which didn’t have any hair entered his sight. I never wanted someone else to see it. I’d shaved it myself and vowed in my heart to show it only to Rafen during our wedding night. I knew that he was staring at my bare area down there with great interest. Even though Rafen was the only person allowed to see it… I felt embarrassed, sad, and terrified.

「I see it.」

Please don’t say it.

I wanted to cover it, but he was strong, and I couldn’t close my legs.

「Ah?!」

His fingers touched my sensitive part. A painful and pleasant indescribable feeling was sent to my head.

He sucked on my neck a couple of times while playing with me down there. And every time he did, I was starting to feel more pleasure than disgust. I remembered the time when I comforted myself while thinking of Rafen.

No!

I didn’t want to feel it with a man other than Rafen.

「You’ve gotten quite wet.」

Contrary to my thoughts, my body continued leaking out indecent fluids.

Without bothering to hide his joyful look, the noble whispered to my ears.

「This should be fine.」

Then, he quickly moved from behind and went in front of me. His penis, which had become unbelievably larger, entered my sight.

「Ehhh!?」

His penis looked completely different from the ones I’d seen when I took care of our neighbor’s baby and the the time when I wiped the body of my younger brother. This one didn’t have a hint of cuteness—it was a monstrous rod. Noble’s would use this to make a baby possessing magic power, so perhaps they turn into such horrifying shape.

Terrifying.

I didn’t want to have intercourse with this horrifying rod which looked completely different to a commoner’s. If my body were to get played by this thing, I felt like I would be ruined beyond recovery.

And if that happened, Rafen and I wouldn’t be able to…

「Behave and look here.」

「Eeek!」

My raised upper body had been pushed down, and my body was facing up once again, looking towards the ceiling. The noble held both of my legs and raised my knees up.

「Please, please dont look!」

「Is that something you’d say after becoming this soaked?」

I knew that my face had turned bright red. I tried closing my legs, but I really wasn’t a match against a noble who had a magic power. His gaze turned to my part down there, he was looking as though he was licking around it.

Immediately after, I felt something wrong with me down there.The feeling was strange, as though something different from his finger was touching it.

The next instant, along with slight pain, he pressed his body down on me.

「Gyuu?!」

Our lips touched each other, and my body was pushed on the bed as he pressed his body on top of me. There was a slightly uncomfortable feeling down there, and I immediately realized what he’d done. I completely understood.

Rafen, I’m sorry…

I couldn’t become an adult together with you.

My tears fell down continuously without stopping, entering inside my ears.

「I’ll start moving.」

I continued enduring his actions while he was holding my head. The poor bed in the room creaked, and his stimulated breath reached my ears. Each time he thrust his monstrous rod deep inside, I felt a tight feeling and my breathing became difficult.

「Mmn! Ahhh! Nnn!」

My body felt slightly better when I let out a sound.

I felt pain every time he pushed my body intensely, so I moved my arms around his back, thinking that perhaps it would restrain his movement. I felt slightly better, as only his lower body was moving now.

「Ahhnn!」

He thrust harder than before. I could tell from his breathing that he was very aroused. Wrapping my hands around his back seemed to have made him more aroused.  A smile on his face, the noble quickened his movements. Even though it was to escape from the painful feeling, I was disgusted with myself for clinging to a man other than Rafen.

「Ku! That’s good! Haa, haa.」

His voice grew louder, movement slower, and then he showed me a smile. A surprisingly gentle smile.

His eyes looked as though he was looking at the person he loved.

His eyes looked as though he was looking at someone important to him.

….. His eyes looked as though he was looking at someone else, through me.

「I, I’m going to cum…!」

Then, the noble thrust so hard, and he pushed his head against my neck.

「Gu! Cumming!」

From his trembling back and irregular heavy breathing, I realized he was pouring his seed inside me. He was thrusting so hard and deep as though he wanted to let it reach the deepest part of my body.

While being embraced, I heard him call a name. It wasn’t my name, but someone else’s. I’d been curious from the start. The noble was not thinking of me at all while we were having intercourse, but a person who resembled me. My appearance might be similar to that person.

I loved Rafen, who always looked at me.

I’d been embraced as someone else’s substitute, and I was nothing more than a woman’s body.

That made me feel very sad, but also a little relieved.

The only one who ever looked at me, was really just Rafen.

Chapter 34: Deliciously Ate the Village Girl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


How much time had passed? When I noticed it, the noble had separated from my body. My whole body felt sticky and sweaty, and fluids continuously came out down there. How many times did he release it inside me? I’d stopped counting after the third time.

I was totally exhausted, without any strength left to raise my body. I wanted to sleep and just forget everything.

「The bath has been prepared.」

「Let me lead the way. It’s fine to just leave Sokola there.」

I could hear Mauve and the village chief’s voice outside the door. That reminds me, the noble rang the bell earlier. They probably heard it and prepared the bath. It didn’t have anything to do with me, though.

「Well done. Wait outside.」

The noble covered his body with a simple clothing and came to the bed where I was resting. I might have to raise my body up to greet him, but it felt troublesome. I turned only my eyes and waited for his words. However, I was so tired, and his words went to one ear and out the other without anything remaining. When I heard the chinking sounds of metal placed on top of my hand, I shut my eyes.

The door was opened and immediately closed.

The room was dark when I opened my eyes. The magic that the noble had used to light up the room had probably been cut. Afterwards, as I was engrossed while naked, someone knocked the door.

Who was it?

「Sokola? I’m entering.」

It was Mauve’s voice. I didn’t care anymore even if Mauve saw my body. Besides, the room was dark. But really, I was so exhaused.

「Uh… What a thick smell, and its completely dark here.」

Footsteps entered the room, and its sound disappeared around the window. While I was thinking whether I’d heard a wooden sound hitting against each other, the window had been opened. The moonlight lit the room and shined on my body.

「Mauve…」

「Sokola, are you alright? It looks like you’ve done it for quite a long period of time. It was your first time… right?」

「Mauvee…」

Apparently, I’d been doing it with him for a quite long period. Mauve’s kindness for caring about me had warmed my heart, and I cried. When Mauve patted my head, my body started shaking.

「Sokola, I’m going to enter. Whoa, this strong smell…」

Several people entered the room with Nasha in the front. It was dark, so I didn’t know who entered. I reflexively tried to hide my body, but while gently caressing my head Mauve spoke.

「Don’t worry. Everyone here is a woman, so you can be at ease.」

Even if they were all woman, I also felt embarassed for being the only one with my lower body naked. Well, forget it. My mind was refusing to think. I could just cross my legs to cover myself. So sleepy…

「Sokola, you’ve done well enduring it.」

I heard a familiar voice.

It was Mom’s voice.

I was relieved, but also felt uneasiness to why Mom was also here.

I still understood that Mauve, Nasha, and Keiha were in the room since we’d come here together, but… When I thought that far, my mind woke up from its sleepiness and began to work.

I felt a chill.

「This amount is amazing. I’ll be able to receive a little with this much.」

Another mother joyfully said while looking at the white fluids spilling out from my body down there.

Able to receive?

「Sokola, sorry. Please endure it.」

Mauve, who had removed her skirt, took the fluids flowing out from down there. She looked at the white sticky fluid around her middle finger once and then thrust it inside her own.

「Nnmm.」

Mauve let out a slightly lewd sound. Starting from her, Nasha and Keiha also entangled the fluids oozing out from inside my body with their fingers, and inserted it inside their own down there.

「I hope I’d get pregnant.」

「Please, let me become pregnant!」

As I was bewildered, the other women also did the same action and accepted the fluids inside their body.

「Hey! What are you all doing?!」

When I raised my voice, my mom held my hand and gently patted my shoulder.

「Thanks to Sokola doing her best to squeeze this much from the noble, everyone could get a share. You’ve done well, good girl.」

Then, Mom also scooped the white fluid flowing out from my body and inserted it down there just like everyone did.

Disgusting.

Disgusting! Disgusting! Disgusting!

The women as they struggled to get the white fluids spilling out from my body was really disgusting. They didn’t care about me after I’d just been violated and were only looking at the white fluids. That made me feel so disgusted.

「Uhhh……」

I couldn’t take this anymore. Rafen, I wanted to see you. I wanted to meet Rafen who cared about me, and only me.

The humiliating sharing continued on.

Totally fed up, I lied down on the bed completely left at their mercy, and then fell asleep.

…..

….

…

Next day.

I went to meet Rafen.

「It must have been painful, Sokola.」

「Rafen…」

The village had been talking about it, and Rafen had already heard that I’d done it with the noble. But, he only hugged me quietly. I was happy. Only Rafen cared about me. I felt my broken heart healing. I was relieved and felt my heart calm.

Having calmed down slightly, I remembered something that was on my mind.

「Rafen, the noble handed me money.」

After we’d done it, the noble told me something and made me hold coins. He gave so many of them, so I placed them in my pocket and took them back home. I had never seen these coins, I think they had a high value because they were sparkling beautifully. After what happened last night, I still hadn’t been able to talk with Mom.

「It’s this coin. Have you seen it before?」

I brought only one coin from the twenty I had received. I placed it on top of my palm and showed it to Rafen. And then, Rafen opened his eyes widely in shock, and took it excitedly.

「Isn’t this a kiris gold coin?! W, wow! It’s the real deal! I’ve seen it before in Nambonan!」

He said as he held the coin towards the sun and squeezed it with his fingers

Speaking of kiris gold coin, that was a very valuable gold coin and even the village chief didn’t have one. It was my first time seeing it.

「Hey, Sokola. How many of this coin did you receive? Just one?」

「Eh… I received f, five.」

I lied.

I was scared of what might happen to Rafen if I told him the the truth.

「F, five?! Are you saying you received five of this?! Are you telling the truth?!」

「Yes…」

「Wow! We can buy anything with five of these kiris gold coins, you know?! As expected of a noble! He could give out five kiris gold coins in just a single night!」

Just a single night…

I see… For him, that was just a single night, he just slept and woke up once.

I felt my body getting colder.

「Rafen…」

「Sokola. No matter what the noble does to you, my feelings for you will never change.」

Those words, too, somehow sounded very superficial.

Right now, was Rafen still looking at me?

Wasn’t he just looking at the gold coins I have?

I was tired of everything.

「What happened, Sokola? Don’t cry.」

Rafen hugged and kissed me.

Just a single night.

In just a single night, I no longer felt anything from his kiss.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 35: Nyuneri City
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


From a distance, a wall which looked like a poor imitation of the Great Wall of China could be seen. That wall was the outermost of the threefold walls circling Nyuneri City. Its length was considerable, but its defense wasn’t comparable to the other two inner walls. It mainly served as a shield against dangerous wild animals, block magical beasts from entering the city, and hinder thieves during their escape. 

「Finally back in Nyuneri City.」

「Yes. We have reached the city just as scheduled on the letter we’ve sent ahead.」

I thought we wouldn’t return on time considering that we’d dropped by a farm village to buy a present on the way home, but it appeared that we’d arrived on time.

「Then there’s no problem. We should be able to arrive at the castle by the afternoon. I’ll cut the support magic.」

I cut off the physical strength enhancement magic applied to the group of soldiers including me. 

Oohh the soldiers raised baffled noises.

The body would temporarily experience a strange sensation after the physical strength enhancement magic had been cut off. The feeling would be like the discomfort when switching from contact lenses to glasses in my previous world. That was particularly the case for those who had received the enhancement; they’d feel sick after the magic had been cut off.

「Thank you, for your consideration. Young Master has supported us for a considerable period of time, does Young Master feel any problem with his condition?」

「There’s no problem.」

Since I wanted to avoid delaying our return which was caused by the steamy reception I’d received in the village, I enhanced the movement speed of the soldiers with magic immediately after we left. Before departing Nambonan, we’d sent a letter of our estimate return time, so my little sister Fanny must be looking forward to my return.

　『Big brother, why were you late to come back? I’ve been eagerly waiting for big brother’s return.』

　『Actually, there was this girl who resembled Fanny on my way home. I felt like I was violating Fanny while I was having sex with her, so I got very aroused. I became too fired up and woke up late the next day, so I’m sorry Fanny.』 

Of course, I couldn’t tell her such thing.

I’d desperately banned myself from masturbating because I’d been intending to release my pent-up load inside Minith or Eve after returning to Nyuneri, but I completely fell into that village chief’s plan. That village chief most likely didn’t know about Fanny, but since his timing was so perfect, I felt like I’d been had. 

Seeing Rumon and Kohali’s intimate sibling relationship, my love for Fanny had further welled up. Then there was the girl who had the same eyes and hair. It would’ve been strange if I didn’t lay my hands on the girl. Just in case, I’d forbidden that village girl from speaking about the fact that I’d called out Fanny’s name during our sex. The people from Quordentz probably wouldn’t find out about it, I hope. I gave her twenty gold coins as hush money, so I think it should be safe. I might’ve given way too much, though, as she was just a simple village girl.

The gatekeeper had probably noticed our group approaching, and by the time we’d gotten close enough to distinguish them, they’d formed a neat line to welcome my return.

My adjutant stepped forward and raise his voice.

「Open the gate!」

「Yes!」

The gate opened, and a peaceful scenery no different from the one outside the gate spread. The farmers were sweating as they worked on the fields here and there. The farmers who had noticed us stopped on their work and lowered their body and head down. I didn’t intend to interrupt their work, and I had nothing in particular to say.  They would just feel troubled if a person from Quordentz house spoke to them.

We’d advanced straight inside as the horse’s trotting sounded.

When we entered the agricultural area inside the city, I noticed that many of the ordinary soldiers had relaxed. Naturally, my bodyguards stayed on their guard.

「Open the gates!」

「Yes!」

After exchanging the same lines, the second wall’s gate, which was the castle town’s boundary, opened. In there was the usual castle town. I often sneaked out to walk around, so I was familiar with the streets.

「Young Master!」

「I’m relieved that you’ve returned safely!」

「Young Master!」

「Congratulations on your first campaign!」

The castle town’s population was very high. We’d become the citizen’s target of attention as I walked while followed by the soldiers. Since I haven’t yet inherited the headship, there were some commoners who greeted me. Of course, they maintained a fixed distance, but they weren’t just simply lowering their head. There was a sense of respect, closeness, and slight awe towards the son of the lord who protected their lives with his powerful magic power. This felt much better rather than them lowering themselves simply because they were afraid.

Nyuneri City was Quordentz house’s base city. Quordentz house had been constantly in a war here and there, but Nyuneri City had never fallen even once. Due to that, there were many old buildings, and it was my pleasure to gather things such as anecdotes and histories related to them when I was exploring the city in secret. Noble’s from other territories also visited Nyuneri City once in a while, and they’d be surprised upon seeing the castle town. There were old church buildings around, which was a rare sight in the Levios Kingdom. 

As we advanced through the main street, there was a response from the detection magic placed lightly around.

「Young Master, please be careful.」

「It’s them?」

Six people consisting of men and women who were walking in the city had caught my attention. Based on their clothes, they must be commoners. They were all magic users. Six commoners possessing a magic power gathered together was a very unusual sight. Probably considering the possibility that they might be assassins aiming to attack me, my guards took out their swords and entered battle mode.

「You lot, who are you! If you try anything strange, we’ll cut you down immediately!」

When the one with the clearest voice among my bodyguards raised a shout towards the six, a commotion rose among the citizens around. Judging whether a person had magic power with just their sight was impossible for ordinary people.

「Eeek! A noble!?」

The group of six didn’t show any resistance and quickly kneeled down on the spot. They were kneeling with their hands on the stone road. On alert, the guards began to question them with their swords pointing towards them. 

「Who are you people?! Why are there so many magic users in your group?! Answer honestly, or else we’ll cut you down!」

The surrounding citizens looked like they’d become aware that the group of six all had magic power upon hearing his words, and people crowded around. From listening to the citizens speak, the six realized that I was Quordentz house’s eldest son Wilk, and they paled while shaking.

「We, we’re adventurers! We haven’t done anything wrong! Please believe us!」

In a submissive posture, the leader-looking man spoke. I sensed that he had a considerable amount of magic power, enough to put up a fight against the weakest among my guards. The six obeyed and took out a paper while trembling. When I glanced at it, the parchment had Nyuneri’s seal.

「…… It’s real.」

The official who received the parchment from the guard had confirmed its validity. Then, the guard glared at the six. 

「You should’ve been told that commoner magic users can’t walk around the city in group. Why are you six gathered together?」

Commoner’s who possessed magic power were not advised to move in groups. Since they could cause harm to the nobles, there were times that they’d be charged with treason simply because they were moving in a group. 

The same applied not only to Nyuneri City but also to other cities no matter the territory.  As for how many were permitted to walk together, it depended on the situation, so there was no fixed number. If they were citizens of Nyuneri, they would receive lenient treatment. However, they weren’t from Nyuneri, but people who came outside. They would be tolerated to some extent in places where people gather such as a bar and inn, but they were in the main street.

A group of six magic users walking in the main street was pretty much a no. They wouldn’t be able to complain even if they were to get executed on the spot.

「We have come from the royal capital! We were allowed to walk in the royal capital together!」

「This is Nyuneri City.」

The leader became depressed upon hearing the guard’s rebuttal. It couldn’t be helped since he couldn’t refute him. This world wasn’t so simple that everything would be all good just because they didn’t know something. They were a very lax group of adventurers.

「Arrest them! I’ll interrogate them later. If they resist, kill them.」

「Yes!」

A look of despair on their faces, the group of six were restrained by three soldiers. They possessed magic power so they could easily sever the ropes binding them, but their heads would be the next one to get severed if they did such a thing. They would probably be obedient and get taken away. 

「Young Master, I’m sorry for the trouble. Please immediately return the castle. Their might be others of them coming from somewhere else.」 

「Very well.」

Ignoring the noise within the city, I gave my horse the signal and advanced.

The buildings around were becoming splendid as we got closer to the castle. As my horse continued, I occasionally glanced at the commoners who were respectfully lowering their heads. After a short while, we’d arrived in front of a dark wall with an oppressive aura. This was the third wall, and Nyuneri Castle was beyond it.

「It’s great to be home again.」

Regardless of whether it was in my previous world or here in another world, there really was no place like home.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 36: Return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When I entered Nyuneri Castle, I immediately reported Nambonan’s situation to Father. There was no problem that I became Nambonan’s mayor since Father had already approved of it. There were no unexpected incidents, so it could only be described as everything went according to plan.

After the report was over, Father ordered the other people in the room to leave.

「…… I heard that you’ve been learning about different kinds of woman.」

「Yes.」

I felt like he just told me ‘I heard that you’ve been screwing around.’

Without any expression, Father rested his chin on his hand.

「There’s nothing wrong about it. So that you can build a good relationship with your future wife, learn about women as much as you like.」

「Yes. I will learn well.」

I was glad that he wasn’t critizing my behavior.

His chin still resting on his hand, my father grinned.

「Still, how did you grow to have that kind of personality… Back when I was learning about women, I usually did it with the same woman. Father often used to scold me to learn about other woman, even though he himself was only intimate with Mother… oh, make sure to keep this conversation a secret.」

Father was surprisingly talking about his sex life. Hearing him talk about his experiences with women, I was troubled on how to reply. He usually had a scary expression, so I would be surprised when he occasionally transformed into a dirty old man.

「There aren’t many with your personality. If Brother were still alive, you two might’ve gotten along well.」

The scene where I was struggling for woman with my uncle surfaced in my mind.

Now that I think about, I didn’t have many acquaintance among nobles who were into having sex with several women. Just as mentioned by my father, he and Grandfather didn’t have many partners, and even the young noblemen who participated in the Nambonan war weren’t the type to randomly lay their hands on a woman. Deanrish even went as far as bringing his favorite girl along. As for those with licentious lower half, other than me, I could only think of Deanrish’s father, Viscount Galliana.

When I asked Father about that matter, he said that getting intimate with a small number of women was the norm for the general nobility. My views, such as ‘its man’s shame to not eat the meal set before him’ or ‘men shouldn’t shy away from having sex’, might be heavily influenced by my previous life.

Well, since there were also exceptions like my deceased uncle, those values apparently weren’t absolute and avoided by them. Instead, nobles were encouraged to have sex with many women.

「Your contribution was enormous for being able to seize Nambonan in a perfect condition. It was a pleasant surprise. I’ll add the necessary funds for your learning. Just speak if you have anything else you need.」

「Thank you. Please leave Nambonan’s management to me.」

I got slightly excited from the unexpected bonus. I wasn’t troubled with money, but I was honestly delighted that he praised my efforts. When considering my father’s age and my age in my previous life, he would be my immediate supervisor, so I somehow remembered my salaryman days.

A serious expression, I bowed properly and ended my report.

I had a late lunch and then invited Fanny for a tea at the garden inside the castle.

「Haa, this scent is very pleasant.……」

「I’m glad and delighted to hear that you liked it. I knew you’d like it, so I bought it on my way back.」

「Fufu, I’m also happy. Even when in a far away place, Big Brother has been thinking about me.」

Fanny seemed lonely for being left alone in the castle without Grandfather, our parents, and me. Father only took a few days to come to Nambonan, but he didn’t have many chances to come in contact with Fanny because he was busy with many matters such as work, going to the house where our Mom lived in the royal capital, and engaging in social activities with the nobles in other territories.

Fanny had been pouting when I invited her for a tea, but her mood took a turn for the better when she found out that I bought a present for her. Dropping by the village was indeed the right decision.

「When I drank this tea at Nambonan, I thought that its your favorite fragrance.」

This was the tea I drank in the bar during the day I made a mess of Anna in many ways. Anna said that the flowering tea could be bought near Nambonan. I thought it was the perfect present for Fanny, so I asked her the location of the village just before we left for Nyuneri.

Since it was called a tea, I somehow imagined they were growing something similar to a tea plant in my previous world, but in the village, they were raising a tiny unusual plant similar to a hydrangea, and they were plucking its leaves. The highest-quality ones seemed to be harvested from the plants that bloom during the summer, and then it would go through drying and fermentation. Unfortunately, I didn’t see them doing those works in the village considering the season.

They had a stock of high-quality leaves, so I sampled it and was able to enjoy the tea’s rich scent and beautiful color. I even bought the leaves based on the village chief’s asking price. That village chief might really be a clever fellow.

「Oh. Fufufu, Big Brother really understands me very well. This tea is warm and it makes me feel very happy. I… I’ve been alone the whole time, so I was very lonely, you know?」

Showing a smile with a hint of sadness, Fanny drank the tea.

I had never been away from Nyuneri for an extended period of time like the one this time. Originally, I should’ve been attending the school for nobles in the royal capital for six years starting when I was eleven years old until sixteen, but the school was currently closed. I had never attended it once. Due to that, it was the first time for Fanny to experience being alone without her family for a long period of time.

「Big Brother, would it be alright if I come to your room tonight? I want to hear interesting stories.」

Her bright smile never considered that I would refuse her request.

Did I have the choice to refuse her? No.

「Of course, you can come.」

I wanted to protect her smile.

As I was walking to my room, I was feeling troubled because I’d been planning to sleep with Eve tonight. I felt like I had a similar trouble in the past. It was enjoyable to talk with Fanny at night, but my enjoyable sex life would go up in smoke.

「Tesh, do you have any good idea?」

「I think Young Master should just summon her during the daytime. I’ll inform the bath servant.」

「I see.」

From the way he spoke, he was probably referring to Eve. Obviously, he wouldn’t be telling to summon Fanny.

Having sex in the daytime, that sounded like an indulgent college student. Unfortunately, I didn’t have such an enviable experience in my previous life.

「The servants have been feeling anxious because Young Miss has always been feeling lonely these past days. That’s why, when we saw her joyful look when Young Master came back…」

The servants seemed like they were really worried about Fanny. As expected, the servants wouldn’t be able to substitute for her family, so they might’ve been feeling vexed.

「Very well. Inform her that from tomorrow onwards, I might be taking a bath during the noon. And, I’m feeling tired from traveling today, so I’d like to enter the bath. Come and call me once the preparations are done.」

「I understand.」

Tesh bowed and left.

I opened the door and went inside my room for the first time in a while. Today’s weather was good, and the sunlight was shining in so brightly from the window. Glasses, which were considered as high-class goods, were used without restrain in the window of my room. It was the kind of room that one would expect from the son of a Marquis.

The glass was colored and not completely transparent, but its transparency was high enough that I could see through beyond the window. Perhaps because the sunlight had warmed up my room, there was a fragrance of a flower inside.

「Hm?」

The door leading to the balcony was made of glass over a wooden frame, similar to a shoji.[1] I could see a shadow beyond the door, but I couldn’t identify the person because the glass wasn’t clear. The person was crouching down without moving.

Opening the glass door quietly, I stepped inside the balcony.

The person crouching down was wearing a female servant’s clothes. So it was a woman. What should I do if the person was a man?

「Oh. So its you, Minith.」

Sure enough, the person crouching was Minith who had received my second-time experience. She was crouching down as she faced the sun’s direction, her fingers interlaced, and eyes closed. She seemed so focused in her praying that she didn’t even hear me.

「Minith.」

I called out to her just beside her, but she didn’t notice me at all. Just as I was thinking of rubbing her ass, Minith slowly opened her eyes.

Then, her gray eyes fixed on my figure.

Her vacant eyes regained its brightness, and then she stood up startled and straightened her posture.

「Young master?! I, I’m sorry!」

Her appearance while blushing as she brushed her hair with her hand and patted her clothes which had gotten wrinkled because she was crouching down was very lovely.

As though all the fatigue in my body had been blown away, I felt blood actively circulating around my body.

[1] Shoji:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 37: Maid’s Prayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I watched Minith as she gently smoothed her clothes. Perhaps because I’d already held her body once, I couldn’t help but imagine her bare body under her clothes, and it made me really aroused. My desire to deeply indulge myself in savoring her sixteen-year-old body which was almost fully matured was welling up.  

 「What are you doing here?」 

 「I was offering my prayer of gratitude to Whatenthsāma.」 

I stopped myself from suddenly pouncing on her, and first asked something that was on my mind. Still, she gave an unexpected reply. 

 「….. Minith, your a Xessian?」 

The religion that people followed the most in this world was Xessianism. Xessianism could be described as close to polytheistic. It was based on the belief that there exist spirits in this world that couldn’t be observed by the eyes. These spirits dwell in nature, living things, and concepts among others. In short, it was based on animism and myriad gods.

Xessianism’s founder, Xess, could apparently hear the voices of these spirits. He traveled around the world as he listened to the voices of different kinds of spirits, and then he compiled their words and spread them to the people.

Xessianism’s scriptures were made up of Xess’ essays and travel journal, the secret stories about the world’s creation which the great spirits had told as well as the teachings of the spirits from different places. This scripture really existed, and I’d read it.

Xessianism also had a religious organization called the Xessian Synod, and standing at the top was the High Priest. According to the Synod, their founder Xess had turned into a spirit after his death, and would occasionally show up in front of the Synod’s believers to impart his will. The believers who heard his voice would then be named a Saint. In the Synod, the Saint’s teachings would be acknowledged as the teaching from the spirits, and would then be treated as a belief. Simply put, the Synod would produce a convenient Saint for their organization, and they would keep creating religious norms. Perhaps that way of handling was effective, the Synod’s influence had surpassed the feudal lords and even the kings.

The sacred writtings that the founder Xess had written was called the True Scripture, while the sacred writtings that the Saints had written were called Holy Scriptures. The believers under the Synod were called Xessians.

Incidentally, the names of the spirits were written only on the Holy Scriptures, so people who called out the name of these spirits were most likely a Xessian.

The spirit Whatenthsāma which Minith had mentioned was known as the Great Spirit of the Sun in the Holy Scriptures. This spirit was among the upper-class spirits in Xessianism. If people had no idea which spirit they should pray, then they would just first pray to the Great Spirit of the Sun.

As I was thinking about those matters, Minith looked at me with serious eyes.

「……No, I’m not a Xessian.」

Quietly, I promted her to continue.

 「My friend in the town invited me to come to the church once if I intend to pray earnestly.」 

That friend is very fishy! 

The reason I thought that was probably because I had the knowledge from my previous life. It was a common thing in this world to invite a person to the church they were affiliated with. As a former Japanese, I always end up thinking about the suspicious invitations from the newly found religions.

「The priest’s story in the church was interesting, so I blurted Whatenthsāma’s name by accident. I’m sorry for using ambiguous words, making Young Master confused.」

「I see.」

As Minith bent her body, I asked her:

「Did you have anything you want to pray for? If you don’t want to say it, then I won’t force you.」

Returning to a straight up posture, Minith said embarrassedly:

「No, I already told about it to the head maid when she confiscated my praying accessory.」

Apparently, Minith had attended at the castle while wearing the necklace used for praying which she had bought in the church. The head maid immediately discovered it, and Minith received the head maid’s lecture and her necklace confiscated.

She said that since the head maid hadn’t lectured her much lately, she was surprised when she’d been scolded for the first time in a while.

「I heard that Young Master left for his first campaign, so…」

Minith turned her eyes towards me once before swiftly turning away.

Her expression clouded slightly.

 「I prayed that Young Master wouldn’t get hurt and he would remain safe.」 

「Hoh.」

 「It was very insolent of me to make light of Young Master’s ability… I’m very sorry. It was to reassure myself because I’ve been feeling very worried.」 

Minith kneeled down and placed her hands on the balcony’s floor.

Taking that pose in front of me, it made me want to pull out my dick and have her suck it.

「Worried, huh.」

「Yes, Young Master’s right.」

Her serious personality was very nice. On one hand, she understood her position without ever growing arrogant just because I’d slept with her once. On the other, I could see that she had grown deeper in love with me, and I felt it was very lovely.

I was starting to get in the mood for passionate sex. The kind of hot sex involving passionate kisses as we collide our affections for each other. I had been forcing myself on others lately, so I wanted to have romantic sex since it had been a while since the last time.

「Minith, stand up.」

「Yes.」

Minith immediately stood up.

Gently, I embraced her body. There was a smell of a flower, just like the fragrance in the room. It was her fragrance.

「Thanks to your prayer, I was able to come back.」

「Young Master…..」

I could feel the sweet breaths coming out from her as she moved her arms around my back and tightly hugged me.

「When I imagine that I would lose Young Master, I…..」

Her eyes which were positioned slightly higher than mine stared at me captivated. 

I caressed her cheek, and while passing my fingers on her hair, I whispered.

「I’m back. You don’t have to worry anymore. 」

I took Minith’s hand and held it. As my temperature was slightly higher than her, I felt great touching her slightly cold hands. I brought our clasped hands slighly higher so that she could see it clearly.

「Ah… Young Master…」

「Come to think of it, the time was also about the same as that day, wasn’t it?」 

Naturally, I was talking about the day when I had sex with her while she was wearing a maid uniform. From what I could remember, I felt like I was also worried about Fanny’s visit during that time.

When I implied my intention to have sex with her, Minith had immediately noticed it, and her face gradually turned red.

She didn’t really voice out her consent, so it made me want to tease her for a bit.

「……Have you forgotten about it? I see, Minith has been playing with another man in the town and has completely forgotten about that day while I was away in Nambonan. That makes me really sad…」

I said with a voice sounding as sad as possible.

Then, she gripped my hands so tightly that it was unbelievable.

「That, that’s not true!!! 」

 I thought she’d be angry, but she was on the verge of tears.

 「I’ve always been thinking of Young Master when he departed for Nambonan! I wished so many times to accompany Young Master! I’ve never forgotten about that day! I would never play with another man, please believe me!」  

Her sparkling teary eyes was in front of me. The only thing in between us was our clasped hands. I slowly lowered our hands.

「I believe you.」

When I slightly placed strength on the arms around her, Minith slowly closed her eyes.

Sunlight shined on her smooth and plump lovely lips.

「mmhm……」

chu 

We exchanged repeated light kisses before separating our faces from each other.

Minith leaned her body on me and was looking with completely entranced eyes.

「There’s still time before dinner.」

「Yes.」

「I want you.」

Minith quietly nodded with a joyful expression, and buried her face on my chest.

Since her hair had been tied up, her exposed nape was very arousing.

I swallowed my saliva and took her inside my room.

Chapter 38: Eating the Loving Maid (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Perhaps I put too much magic power, the door closed with a startingly loud sound when I closed it with magic. It looked like I was a little excited.

While I was calming myself down, the room suddenly darkened. Glancing towards the window, Minith was just about to close the curtain.

I remembered that the curtain was fully opened the last time we had sex because I wanted to appreciate her frilly maid uniform. Today, Minith was wearing the old uniform, the one lacking in charm.

「Are you going to close it?」

「Ah, does Young Master prefer it bright?」

Let’s see…

I really wanted to take her clothes off since it wasn’t appealing, and it might be good to have a careful look at her naked body in the light.

「Um, I feel embarrassed… if its bright…」

Pulling up the edge of the curtain to cover half her face, Minith looked very charming. In consideration of her charm, I decided to let her close the curtain. As the curtain was thick, the room had become quite darker.

「Don’t make it too dark.」

「I understand.」

Sitting on the bed, I watched Minith’s movements. The room was large, so it took quite some effort to close the curtain. After she closed it while leaving a small opening, she quietly came closer.

「Sit here.」

Indicating where she should sit with my hand, I waited for her to sit down. Even though there was no one else other than the two of us in the room, she thanked me in a low voice and sat down.

I laid my hand on her hand which was sitting on her lap.

「It’s just bright enough. I can clearly see your face.」

The room had become dim, but there was no problem once our eyes adjusted to the darkness. I stared at Minith’s eyes while gently caressing her hand. Then, she closed her eyes with her face slightly upwards, looking as though she was anticipating something. Responding to her, I slightly raised my body.

Lightly, I gave a kiss on her lips and enjoyed its softness before quickly moving away.

「Nm…?」

Bewildered, Minith slowly opened her eyes. She silently sent a begging glance before immediately closing it again. Her stuck out tongue looked like it was requesting for another kiss, and it was very sexy.

「Minith…」

This time, I grasped her shoulders and gave her a deeper kiss than the last one. I softly bit on her lips and savored its softness. Minith also responded by lightly biting with her lips, and I could feel its pleasant squishy feeling.

Just as I was about to separate from her, she wrapped her arms around my head and continued kissing.

「mhhm…! mwah…mnah…mwah♡.」

And it didn’t end there. She took the initiative and started to insert her tongue inside my mouth. Her heated tongue met and entwined with mine inside my mouth. Our saliva blended and dripped from our entwined tongues and then disappeared deep in my throat.

「Ahh…mmhm…haaa…nnhm, haa…mwah…mwah…」

Our stuck out tongues twined together, pulling a transparent thread that dripped down on the bed. When I came to it, we were hugging each other.

「Love you… young master… mhmmwah… I love you…♡mmhnm…」

Minith pushed herself into me from a higher position due to her heigh advantage and continued her passionate kissing. I responded with great effort to not lose to her and continued taking in the saliva coming from her which seemed to have made my head numbed

「mhm… mwah.」

I reluctantly watched as her wet tongue left from my mouth. My faced covered in saliva, Minith and I stared at each other.

「Minith, that was very great.」

「Young Master…」

Minith wrapped her arms around my head towards her chest. Held beside her chest, I could feel the intense beating of her heart.

「I’m glad… that I could be together with Young Master again… I’m really glad… 」

Her arms were trembling, and her voice quivered as though she was feeling relieved from the bottom of her heart. I couldn’t answer back because my head was pressed against her chest, and I couldn’t breathe!

「… I thought that it was just a one time casual relationship before Young Master left for his first campaign…」

I must act cool here and tell her that she was wrong. Feeling slightly reluctant to part with her soft breasts, I wriggled out from her chest.

「That’s not true.」

This time, I tightly held Minith’s head on my chest. The feeling coming from her head was slightly ticklish but more than that it brought me a pleasant feeling.

「Young Master… I…」

Before she could finish her words, I sealed her mouth with a kiss. I wanted us to communicate not with words, but with our bodies. I conveyed my intentions with my eyes.

「… I understand.」

Her voice as she replied contained sweetness that she would entrust it to me, and she nodded. It seemed she understood my intention.

Lowering my hands which were wrapped around her back, it reached her firm and soft curves.

「Ahhn!」

Minith let out a lovely cry when I slid my finger between the bed and her ass. I explored with my fingers and enjoyed the pleasant feeling.

「Ah, ahh! It tickles!」

Minith moved her arm to her bottom and prevented my fingers from moving. Aiming for that chance, I succeeded in slipping my other hand towards her breast. I lightly fondled her soft breast while pleasuring her ass.

「Your breasts are really soft. I don’t want to release it.」

「mmhn… please, touch me…」

Even though the room was dim, I knew full well that Minith’s face bright red. I got on the bed and positioned myself on top of her and then I placed my hand around her back and put her down on the bed facing up.

「… mmhm.」

As I fondled her breast with my hand, I gave her a soft kiss. Breasts were really a great thing. Minith breasts were tight, and it felt really great. I could clearly feel it on my hand.

「Noo! Not… my breast…」

Even though she told me to stop, there was no way I could stop it. Long live breasts! Breasts, justice!

My nerves were focused on my palm and fingertips.

My dick had gotten completely erect, and I could feel slight wetness from its tip. It looked like I was a little too aroused and quite a lot of pre-cum was leaking out.

When I touched my groin area to check it’s condition, Minith looked like she sensed something.

「Young Master……I, too……♡」

Minith placed her hand on my stretched lower garment. Her touch made me want to release not just pre-cum, but my thick semen.

I understood what she was wanted to do, so I immediately took my clothes off. It was bothersome, so I took off both my upper and lower clothing, becoming completely naked. I almost ejaculated when my clothes brushed on my manhood, but I was somehow able to endure it.

「Ah! it has become so large… I’m happy… ♡」

Minith also took her clothes off while I was undressing, and both of us were completely naked. Her beautiful tight breasts and vagina covered by her pubic hair was extremely tempting.

Seeing my erect dick facing proudly upwards, Minith showed a shy smile.

「Young Master, excuse me.」

Sitting on the bed, Minith moved her face closer to my erect dick at the side. Then, she splendidly took my meat-stick inside her mouth.

「Ohh!」

「Mmmgg… Nnuu……」

I’d sweated considerably because I moved by a horse this morning. In the first place, I had only cleaned my body with a wet towel ever since the last time I took a bath in the village where I bought tea leaves, so my dick might be smelly.

Minith didn’t release my dick from her mouth, but her expression distorted slightly.

「Minith, y-you don’t have to force yourself.」

I felt ashamed letting her suck my dick which reeked of sweat. But, a sense of happiness enveloped my chest, so even though I told her not to force herself, I couldn’t force her to stop sucking it. I didn’t want to stop her.

「mhmuu. mhmm…」

Minith’s tongue vigorously brushed the head of my dick. She stroked my dick while sucking it whole with her head moving back and forth, licking it clean all the way to the base.

It looked like she was telling me that my dick wasn’t dirty at all with her action. My eyes met with her upturned eyes, and she gave me a sweet smile and continued sucking my dick. Her expression greatly touched me.

「Minith.」

I called out her name while she was moving her head up and down sucking my dick. I was about to ejaculate even at this moment, but I desperately held it back. Placing my hand on her head, I gently brushed her hair and told her my desire.

「I want to let it out inside you. Not inside your mouth, but here.」

There was wet sound when I touched her there. I moved my finger around her soaking wet vagina.

「mhm!」

Minith released my dick from her mouth along with a slurp noise.

My red and erect dick was slightly trembling, eager to carry out its duty. I must use it to perform its intended purpose. I pushed Minith down on the bed.

「I’m going in, Minith! Accept me!」

「Please… give me, young master!♡」

I placed my twitching dick on her honeypot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 39: Eating the Loving Maid (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


My dick, which was about to explode even at this moment, was penetrating deeper inside Minith’s soaking wet and loosened honeypot. When I thrust it inside her in a missionary position, it was smoothly taken in and enveloped by her warm vagina. This feeling was incredible.

「Mmhm… Ah, Young Master…」

Looking at my dick which had been completely swallowed by her, I happened to see Minith’s love juices dripping out and staining the sheets. As our lower bodies were joined, I held her hands, laid my body against hers, and kissed her lips.

「mwah…… nmhmm…… mwah…… mwah…… mwah♡」

Minith’s sugar-sweet voice was stuck in my head.

I felt the sense of connection I had with her with my whole body. A very pleasant feeling assaulted me, as though our bodies were becoming one as we rubbed against each other.

「Young… master… mhm… aahmm…」

I didn’t want to move anymore, and my mind was filled with the desire to shoot my load inside her while enjoying this feeling of connection. However, with my desire to feel good as well as my desire understand her body’s shape, I moved my hips.

I slowly pulled my manhood and then thrust it deeply once more. 

「Haa, haa.」

Back and forth, I focused on thrusting my hips and enjoyed her moans. I felt aroused seeing Minith’s average-sized breasts which were appropriate for her age sway everytime I thrust.

「Ah!… Ahh!… Ahhh!… Ahh!… Aaah♡!」

I felt like my semen was already leaking out, but I couldn’t confirm it since the tip was inside her. I felt a sense of release, as though there was a hole breaking open the limit of what I could endure. From that feeling, I understood. 

My aroused mind was screaming to me, that it would be a waste to ejaculate nearby her entrance. 

I should plant my seed deep inside her, towards the place where it should belong. That was what my instincts were screaming. 

Shortly after, my climax arrived.

「Minith, Minith! I’m cumming!」

「Young master! Young master!!!」

When I thrust my dick deep inside her, Minith wrapped her arms around my neck, and her legs locked around my ass. The feeling of orgasm swelled high up inside me upon seeing Minith’s whole body demand for my semen. 

Cumming!

「Guu! Minith! Take it all inside you!」

「Ahhhh! Please give me lots! Young master, I love you! I love you!♡」

My semen ejected out in great force, rushing inside her vagina. When I came to it, we were exchanging an intense kiss. A large volume of semen continued coming out many times over without stopping. Each time I loosened my semen, I was intoxicated by the feeling that I was coloring her body in my semen. 

This was the best.

Her especially soft vaginal wall was tightly squeezing my penis in a rhythm, seeking for my sperm. As I left my dick to her, my body continued letting out my load over and over again.

「Minith… Ah…」

Randomly, I called out Minith’s name. I had an illusion that my innermost thoughts rushed out along with my semen, and Minith took it all.

「I love you…♡ Young master…… I love you……」

Closely, Minith stared at me with loving eyes.

The initial spurt had calmed down. But, slowly and unevenly, I still continued delivering my seed. While that was happening, Minith and I were connected by a deep kiss.

「Mmhhm, mwah♡ … mwah♡… fhaa… mwah. Young master, I love you, very much…♡」

I showed a smile at Minith while she stared me lovingly. I understood what she wanted. As my ejaculation ended and I entered semi sage mode, I whispered to her ears in a tone sounding as sweet as possible.[1]

「I also love you, Minith.」 

Moving my face slightly away from her ears, I planted a kiss on her cheek. Following that, I intensely kissed her body a number of times, including her nape, collarbone, and breasts. Unconsciously, I was declaring that she was mine.

Minith let out a seductive sound with a hint of satisfaction, and then she closed her eyes.

「I’m glad… Young master…」

I laid my body on her with my dick which had gotten softer still penetrated inside her body. Our sweat covered body was stuck close, feeling each other out.

「I gave everything to you. It’s all yours.」

「Really…?」

「Yes, I’ve been squeezed dry. Isn’t it because your body wanted my semen?」

「Stop! Ah! so embarassing…」

Minith covered herself with the blanket laid out below and hid her face. I didn’t mind it and continued.

「You’re not going to deny that your body wanted my semen?」

「It’s because… I don’t want to lie to Young master…」

My penis showed a response from hearing her words. It was showing signs of a comeback.

I hugged Minith along with the blanket, and repeatedly brushed her hair.

「Mmhm……」

「Wow, I really release a lot. Once I pull it out, it would probably spill out immediately.」

I moved my lower body to show it to her that we were still joined together.

Then, Minith moved her hand and touched our joined area, and then she stared at the white fluid that was sticking on her finger. She showed a satisfied yet somewhat anxious expression.

「What’s wrong?」

「I’m, just surprised… when I think that this was inside my body… 」

Minith stared at the semen on her fingertips, and her expression gradually clouded over. Although a little late, it looked like she’d become conscious of the fact that I released my semen inside her vagina.

「Don’t worry!」

I placed my hand on Minith’s head and gently caressed her.

「Even if you get pregnant, I won’t abandon you. I promise. Believe in me!」

「Young Master…」

As though all her worries were gone, Minith dived into my chest. My ‘I’m a reliable man’ appeal seemed successful.

Seeing how much the girl loved me, I had no intention of disregarding her. The words I told her were true.

Minith extended her arms toward me, and I held it.

「I promise.」

「Uhhh……」

Those words decided it, and tears fell down from Minith’s eyes. I kissed her and licked off the tears flowing down her face. It tasted slightly salty. 

Gently, I patted her trembling back.

「That’s why, you also have to keep our promise, okay? 」

「… Our promise?」 

Perhaps she had completely forgotten about it, or she couldn’t remember it, Minith showed a confused look.

「It’s not young master, right? Aren’t we alone together right now?」

「Ah…」

We made a promise that she wouldn’t call me young master when we were together alone. I’d been keeping silent about it since I was quite aroused when she called me young master.

「Is it really fine?」

As a maid, Minith was probably hesitant to call me by my name. Even though it was a promise between the two of us, it seemed that she couldn’t easily call me by my name.

Holding her hands, I nodded.

「Wilk-sama……」

「Yes.」

「Wilk-sama♡!」

As Minith continuously called out my name, I was feeling her body. There was softness, tightness, and warmth. I touched her around, to confirm that she was indeed here.

After that, my dick made a splendid comeback, and I took my time to shower Minith with love.

After finishing our second round, I rang the bell and summoned Tesh. I couldn’t help but laugh when I saw him appear while holding a flower, which would be used to erase the smell in the room. Tesh was a capable man.

[1] Sage mode: The period after orgasm when a man is free from sexual desire and can think clearly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 40: Castle Maids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I was so sleepy.

I walked through the corridor with my half-asleep body.

After finally arriving in front of the women’s changing room, I halted and checked my appearance.

Alright, there shouldn’t be anything wrong with my clothes.

Casually looking outside from the window, the sun was almost gone, and I could see the dusky sky and clouds. I wanted to thank the Great Spirit of the Sun once more for bringing today’s events. I offered my prayer towards the withdrawing sun.

「Minith, what are you doing there?」

Hearing a familiar voice behind me, I opened my eyes and turned around. Standing there was one of my fellow maids.

「I was only looking outside. Locary, are you also done with your work?」

「Yes. It was the same old work.」

Locary was a non-exclusive maid. I’d been hired in Nyuneri Castle two years earlier than her, so she was my junior even though our age was the same.

Also because our age was the same and both of us were commoners from the castle town, she was my best friend.

I opened the door to the women’s changing room and entered inside with Locary. It was deadly silent inside, and it looked like the others hadn’t come yet.

Both of us released a breath. Only maids could enter this room, so it was fine to relax a little in here.

In a lighthearted voice, Locary spoke:

「Minith and the others must’ve been very busy because Young Master has returned this noon.」

「Yes, we were busy because Young Master’s back…」

Ever since we’d been told that Young Master would be returning to Nyuneri Castle, his personal maids had been very busy every day. Especially today, which was the day of his return. It was tough because we’d all been working from early in the morning.

But, my efforts had been rewarded

「What’s wrong? You look very tired… Your beloved Young Master is back, right? He might not call you out again if you look like that, you know?」

「Eh…? A-ahaha, is that so?」

Sweat dripped down. I guess she would never imagine that I was just called out a while ago. Probably because she saw that I was hesitant to speak, Locary cheerfully consoled me.

「Cheer up! You’re the first chosen woman, have some confidence!」

The first woman…

Before Young Master left for his first campaign, I became his woman. After we had sex, Tesh-sama and the Head Maid had asked me about it in detail. I was so embarrassed that my face was bright red. In the end, they concluded that there was no problem, and felt relieved. I think the person who felt the most relieved was me because I’d been set free from their interrogation.

It would’ve been nice if it ended there, but the fact that I slept with Young Master quickly became known because several maids were called out to clean the room.

And so, I’d become famous among the maids in the castle as the first maid who slept with Young Master. I was happy when he called me out, but I honestly felt very embarrassed.

「Ahh, I also want a man who will give me a beautiful dress and hug me tightly… 」

When she heard that I’d become Young Master’s woman, Locary pestered me about it. Around that time, the hottest topic among the maids was about who was going to be Young Master’s first woman among us. No one probably expected that I would be the first one, considering that there were so many others more beautiful than me.

During that day of my first time, I was slightly excited, and I wanted someone to hear me out. After work on our way home, I talked to Locary about it, including the fact that young master handed over a beautiful dress which looked like the ones that noblewomen would wear.

「That dress wasn’t prepared for me. It was a sample.」

「Eh～? That’s definitely a liee!」

Showing a playful smile, Locary continued.

「The dress was perfectly fit for you. Furthermore, he remembered your name and treated you nicely. So, can you really say that it was all a coincidence? 」

「But, I was told that…」

「Young Master was just embarrassed! He was hiding his embarrassment and showed the dress to you while pretending that it was a sample, I’m sure! Wow, you’re really loved. Perhaps you might get called tonight?」

She was probably trying to cheer me up since she saw me looking tired. But when she put it that way, I felt that she might be correct. Maybe she was right, that Young Master prepared that wonderful dress for me. Oh no, I couldn’t stop myself from smiling. 

As Locary was getting all worked up while screaming, I was desperately trying to hide my smiling face.

「You two, I can clearly hear your voices from the corridor.」

Along with those words, the Head Maid walked briskly inside the room. Locary and I reflexively held our breath. Sharply looking at the two of us, the head maid spoke.

「Even though this is the changing room, it’s still inside Nyuneri Castle. You shouldn’t make so much noise like a town girl.」

Ah, we were definitely going to receive her scolding.

「Especially you, Locary. It’s outrageous to make unjustified suspicions on Young Master’s thoughts. Come to my room before you head home. It looks like I’ll need to straighten your attitude as a maid.」

「Yes…」

Locary hung her head.

She was just trying to cheer me up. Sorry, Locary.

「And you, Minith. Why do you look like that?」

「Eh?」

I didn’t expect her words. There was nothing wrong with my clothes… and there were no wet parts too.

「I’m not referring to your clothes. You received Young Master’s love a while ago, correct? Afterward, did you not look in front of a mirror when you wore your clothes? 」

「Eeehhh?! Minith, you made love with Young Master today?!」

Locary raised a loud voice… and received the head maid’s scolding. Silly girl.

Still, there was no need for the Head Maid to talk about that matter here.

「Um, I haven’t looked in front of a mirror. 」

「Then do so next time. There are marks on your neck, and it might arouse other men. Young Master seem to like you, so there probably won’t be any men who will lay their hands on you here in the castle, but that won’t be the case when you’re in the castle town.」

「Ah, Minith, you have kiss marks on your neck. I didn’t notice it because of the sunset. 」

I see.

There was a novel that had been getting popular among the maids. Apparently, kiss marks would remain when kissed on the neck and the breast area. In that novel, there was a scene where the female protagonist wanted to keep the man’s love all to herself. When they were having sex, she sucked his neck and left a mark to show off to the other women that the man belonged to her.

I couldn’t see my neck, but there seemed to be a red mark. Young master left a mark on my neck? I felt very pleased when I thought of that.

「It will attract good-for-nothing men, so stop smiling there and quickly cover it with a cloth. Besides, you might earn the resentment from your seniors who wanted to receive young master’s love.」

「Y-yes!」

I kind of felt like I wanted to show it off, but I didn’t want to invite unnecessary troubles. If by any chance that Young Master heard about it, it would be very embarrassing.

Locary pointed the red marks, and I wrapped a cloth around my neck. The head maid waited for me to finish covering it up, and spoke.

「Concerning the compensation for being called out by Young Master, it would be added to your salary. But, the compensation won’t be comparable to the first time. 」

My salary last month was very great. I lost my virginity when I had sex with young master, and the compensation for that had been included in my salary.

But I wasn’t really happy about it. For some reason, it made me feel that I was only aiming for the money. I didn’t feel the sense of achievement when my salary increased due to my own hard work. If anything, I didn’t want to accept it. There was no need for me to worry about this problem, I thought.

「Um…」

「I won’t approve of you not accepting it.」

Her flat out response completely read what I wanted to say, so I was shocked. How did she know…? The head maid was amazing.

「I understand that you don’t want to accept the money. 」

I nodded quietly.

「However, you have to consider your master. If you don’t accept the money, other people would think that Young Master is a stingy person who won’t pay his maid for making her his woman. Is that what you want? 」

「No.」

「Then accept it. It’s for your young master.」

I absolutely didn’t want others to talk bad about Young Master because of me. Being a burden to him was the last thing I wanted to do.

I looked at the Head Maid, and quietly nodded.

「Let me give you a piece of advice. If you don’t know how to spend your money, then use it to buy a good make-up set and beauty products. Young Master will be happy if you’re beautiful, and he’ll probably call you out more often. 」

「…Yes!」

Her advice was very helpful. I hadn’t been thinking anything up until now, and I’d only been using the make-up set given to me by Mom. The Head Maid was right. On my next day off, I would go to the market and find a good make-up set.

Then perhaps young master would look at me more, and he might even hold me lovingly again. For me, that was a very attractive thing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 41: Night, Brother and Sister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I enjoyed the feeling of Fanny’s silky hair between my fingers. She was faintly smiling as I brushed her hair.

After I had sex with Minith, I took a bath and ate my dinner, and then Fanny visited my room just as planned. Like last time, Fanny was truly pleased on seeing the room filled with deodorizing flower, and she was in a good mood. Apparently, Tesh had arranged her favorite flower.

We were now sitting together facing the table, and I was amusingly telling her about the incidents that happened in Nambonan.

It seemed that Fanny had really been feeling lonely. She was sticking very close to me, which made me quite excited. I was glad that I held Minith this afternoon. Enduring this body contact was not a problem since I had no pent-up load.

Even if I were to get totally aroused, there was no way I could lay my hands on her since her personal maids were in the room as usual.

Completely ignorant of my thoughts, Fanny’s personal maids looked relieved when they saw her in a good mood.

「Big Brother, what kind of people are the adventurers who came to Nyuneri? Are they different from the travelers that Big brother hired back then?」

We finally entered the part I entered inside Nyuneri City. I was telling her about the careless adventurers who were arrested by my guards for walking in a group.

「Right, adventurers are…」

In this world, there existed places shrouded in white fog all year round regardless of the weather. Apparently, it was more like an unknown smoke than a fog, but was treated as fog since it looked like one when viewed from afar. That land covered in a white fog was called「Field」. They existed in many sizes, with some as small as a village and some as large as a territory.

The white fog that shrouded the field could warp the terrain and give birth to magical beasts. The beasts born inside would roam within the field like a goldfish in a fish tank, and continue growing.

Magical beasts living in the same field would kill each other upon meeting. The survivor would absorb a portion of the other’s strength, and grow stronger. That menacing process would unfold within the field, and after a period of time a magical beast with terrifying power would be completed.

The magical beast which had accumulated tremendous power would then come outside the field to look for its next prey. The kind of magical beasts that would Intentionally come outside the field were all very savage and powerful. They could easily destroy villages and collapse the city walls.

The extent of their power depended on the size of the field where they lived. If they came outside of a large field, an army without a magic user would find it impossible to oppose it. Even if they had a few of them, they still wouldn’t be a match. In the worse case, the magical beast would be so strong that it would impossible to defeat it without hitting it with a magic on par with a noble’s.

However, magical beasts would gradually weaken if they leave the field, so there was no problem in winning by attrition. If it was just winning, then there was no problem. It would result in winning the war but losing the battle.

Magical beasts were viewed as bringers of calamity. After they raged around the land, all that would remain were unknown plagues and ruined lands that would take decades to recover. Since they spread calamity to the land when fought for a long period of time, it would result in very severe damage. Although dangerous, it would take about several decades to produce a powerful magical beast.

As for the magical beasts that hadn’t yet matured inside the field, even ordinary people with a weapon could deal with most of them. In addition, a mysterious stone called magic stone could be obtained inside their body. It was apparently closer to clay than stone, though.

If magic stones were gathered and processed, they’d become a mysterious magic-repelling dark stone, and they could sell for a high price. Magical beasts were the source of the dark stone which was used in the walls of Nyuneri Castle and Nambonan City’s walls.

Adventurer was the general term for people who earned money by entering the field to gather magic stones by defeating weaker magical beasts and gathering rare materials from the land which had turned into a warped area due to the effect of the fog. The emergence of a powerful magical beast could be prevented by hunting them to a certain extent, so the adventurers were really helpful. There wouldn’t be any need to dispatch the army every time too.

I explained about that matter to Fanny.

「Field? Big Brother, have you been inside one? 」

「No, I haven’t. 」

Inside the field, not only would the fog hinder the vision, it often had a peculiar power that made it difficult for detection magic to work. The danger level was high.

I heard about the field back then, and I wanted to enter inside it, but Father and even Mother and Grandfather didn’t allow me. For the nobles, fields were places to avoid.

「There’s a field close to Nyuneri, so perhaps the arrested adventurers were trying to go there? 」

There was also a field near Nyuneri City. During a clear day, a part of the fog could be seen in the distance when viewed from the castle’s highest point.

「Eh… There’s a field near the castle as well? Won’t the magical beasts come and attack us…?」

I placed my hand on Fanny’s head as she looked at me uneasily.

「Don’t worry. They are being hunted periodically, and there’s been a notice from the Kingdom, so the number of adventurers have increased lately. Besides, I’ll protect you if a magical beast appears. Be at ease.」

「Okay, Big Brother, I believe in you. 」

Fanny’s clear blue eyes firmly looked at me, and I could see from her eyes that she completely believed in me. When I caressed her head, Fanny narrowed her eyes like a cat basking in the sun.

「…… I’m getting very sleepy.」

Showing a gentle smile, Fanny snuggled into me.

This was the sign that she wanted me to carry her to the bed.

I’d been going to bed alone lately, so I felt like it had been a while since she behaved like this. Fanny usually liked to be pampered, but it seemed that she was feeling at ease after finally receiving attention from her family.

「Your really a baby.」

I placed my hands on her back and under her knees, and then lifted her up like a princess. It was difficult to carry her since the difference in our body was only two years, but I had to display my strength as his brother here.

I lifted her up with just my own strength, without using any physical strength enhancement magic. If I were to use magic at such a close distance, she would notice it from the flow of magic. Fanny had a slender body, and she wasn’t heavy, so I should be able to carry her somehow.

Little sister, look at your reliable big brother. He can carry you without relying on magic.

When I carried Fanny to the bed, a maid opened the blanket and straightened out the sheets. I placed her down on the space prepared on the bed, and then a blanket was put on her.

「……Big Brother.」

She was probably telling me to come and sleep with her. Without any sexual meaning, though.

I lightly shook my head to the side.

「I still have a letter to read.」

I brushed Fanny’s hair and then headed to my desk.

A letter had arrived from Doran, the slave trade who sold Eve to me.

「Let’s see.」

I skimmed through the typical opening greeting. The main point was all I wanted to read.

I had sent a letter to Doran telling him to prepare Eve’s mother because I’d like to buy her. I left for the war with Nambonan early in the morning two days later, so I didn’t have the chance to read his reply. While I was out, Tesh handled the letter and replied to Doran to wait for a while.

There were three letters on my hand right now. One was the first letter that he sent. The second was the reply to Tesh, and the third was a recently sent letter.

Summing it up: Eve’s mother has been secured as merchandise, please contact me when you return. I will go and deliver the merchandise.

I was glad she hadn’t been sold to another person. I would be able to enjoy both the mother and daughter.

The price for Eve’s mother was also written in the letter, and she was much cheaper than Eve… No, it was wrong to compare them in the first place. Her price was still very high, considering the price of a single slave. As expected of an elf, even a woman who had already given birth to a child would sell for a hell of a price.

I thought of writing my reply to him, but I decided to write it after first seeing Eve’s condition. Since the night I forced myself on her, I had no idea about what she’d been doing.

I considered asking Tesh about it, but there wasn’t a good chance to ask. In the end, I hadn’t been able to ask him about it.

She wasn’t in the room given to her in the castle, so perhaps she was in my residence in the castle town.

I finished reading the letter and placed it inside the drawer. There was a chance that Fanny would see it if I left it on the desk.

「Big Brother……」

My body reacted with a start from hearing her voice. It was fine since the letter was inside the drawer.

Having noticed that I’d finished reading the letter, Fanny called out at me with a sleepy voice. She was really feeling sleepy.

「I’ll be there now. 」

After I stretched myself, I went close to the bed where Fanny was waiting.

Seeing that, my servants and Fanny’s servants came closer and sat on the chair arranged at our side.

Incidentally, these servants would be working as the night watch. They had the duty to keep watch so that Fanny and I wouldn’t have sex. Although called a night watch, they weren’t looking over us with serious attention. It was more like they were watching over us warmly. They were probably just watching to prevent anything from happening by any chance. Well, if they weren’t here, the 1 out of 10,000 chance that something might happen would probably turn to 1 out of 100.

「Big Brother, goodnight.」

「Goodnight, Fanny.」

I brushed the back of her hair downwards, and then cut the illumination magic. Suddenly the room became dark, and I couldn’t see for a moment since my eyes had gotten used to the light. Only the moonlight entering through the curtain’s gap illuminated the room.

Fanny’s temperature was much higher than mine, so I felt very warm. Her little body felt like a bottle of hot water.

Fanny had immediately fallen asleep.

I touched her cheek, and it felt squishy. Her completely trusting appearance was very adorable.

While I was feeling Fanny’s cheek, my consciousness gradually grew darker.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 42: Innovation Association
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Thanks to getting plenty of sleep and my young body with active metabolism, I had a pleasant morning with my lower half brimming in energy. I hurriedly left the room while Fanny was sleeping at the side and couldn’t see my rock hard thing.

After eating breakfast with Fanny, I immediately began my preparations to go to the castle town. Perhaps because she’d received plenty of attention last night, Fanny returned to her room without sticking much to me, which made me a little sad. 

「Young Master, may I ask where are you planning to go today?」

「My residence. I want to take a look at Eve’s condition. She’s there, right?」

Unexpectedly, Tesh shook his head to the sides.

「No, that girl is now in the Innovation Association’s main building.」

「In the Innovation Association?」

The Innovation Association was an organization established for me by Father. It was like a state-owned enterprise… No, I guess it should be called a territory-owned enterprise. It was an organization that Father formed because it was inefficient to assemble commoners every time I would create some useful things using the knowledge from my previous world.

The organization existed mainly to realize my ideas, and its job was mostly the development of new products as well as the establishment of their production site. The organization was named “Innovation Association” since it was responsible for the creation of new business in the territory.

「Yes. We couldn’t let a newly bought slave copy Quordentz family’s important documents right away, so I thought that we should see things first by entrusting her with some work in the Innovation Association.」

Then, Tesh lowered his head. He was probably apologizing for moving my slave without getting my permission.

Indeed, it wouldn’t be reassuring to immediately let her touch the valuable documents in the castle’s warehouse. It was said that she could write, but we didn’t know how good she really was, so letting her work in the  Innovation Association was a good idea.

「I don’t mind. It’s only natural that you’re concerned about it. Well then, I’ll go to the association.」

The main building was established in the castle town partly because civilians worked there. In that respect, it was like my mansion. The only difference was that my mansion was in the high-class residential area, while the Innovation Association’s main building was in the commercial district. Going to my residence or to the association seemed to need different preparations, and the servants were all very busy preparing.

I walked along the commercial district while taking a sideglance at Nyuneri City’s morning bustle. As long as I didn’t ride on a horse or put my family’s crest, there was practically no citizen who would notice that I was the eldest son of Quordentz family.

Aside from the guards standing at the side, there was also another team of guards in the surroundings. That said, only a skilled assassin would probably notice them.

I passed through the civilians and entered the Innovation Association’s main building.

「President, I’m glad to see you come.」

It seemed that they were informed in advance, and when I entered the building, the employees welcomed me altogether. I had the highest status here, so I was treated as the president.

Father and Grandfather were usually positioned above me, so it was rare for me to be in the top position. The only places where I would be treated as the big boss was probably here since I was the president, and in Nambonan as their mayor.

「Good job welcoming me here. You can all return to your work.」

I waved my hand to make them go back to their work and then I proceed towards the president’s office.

The room appeared carefully cleaned, and there was no dust even though I hadn’t been able to come here for a while.

「Do you have anything to report?」

I didn’t want to ask about my sex slave right away, so I started by briefly asking the employees in the room about work. The employees here were the management staff.

「Things are doing good for the most part. Only, there’s not enough food for the silkworms.」

「I see.」

The Innovation Association had their arms around many things, but the biggest source of profit were the soap and silk. The soaps were produced using the knowledge from my previous world, while the silk by magic experiment. 

 Silk was a high-class good, and not a long time ago none of the territories in the Levios Kingdom could produce them. However, there was a civil war in Mamshred Federation around 30 to 40 years ago, causing a large number of refugees. Some of the refugees took refuge in Levios Kingdom’s land, and one of the things they brought with them was silkworm. Apparently, Levios Kingdom’s silkworm culture had started there. 

During the time I reincarnated and could move my body to some extent, I obtained a silkworm by moving behind the scenes. I didn’t know how many species of silkworm existed in my previous world, but in this world, there were many closely-related species. The silkworm that the refugees brought with them produced light green silk and not a beautiful white one. Although a high-class good, the silkworm couldn’t produce the highest quality of silk. At present, Mamshred Federation had a monopoly on the production of the highest quality pure white silk.

At that time, I was thinking about trying to improve the silkworm’s production and fiddled with it with my newly learned magic. Using my tremendous magic power, I did many things such as flooding it with healing magic, casting a physical strength enhancement, and applying pressure by releasing pure magic power. I still remembered that the servants at that time were relieved that my target was a worm and not a civilian.

And then after several years of fiddling with the silkworm, its silk production had increased and reproductive power improved. Unfortunately, the color of the silk remained light green. That time was also the period when I was making money with my soap business, so I also decided to start a business with silk. Nowadays, Nyuneri’s silk had some popularity. There was a demand for silk from the nobles and the ordinary people, so the market for it was considerable, so much that even the dress that Kohali had been wearing was made from that silk.

The people working in Mamshred Federation’s sericulture industry were most likely feeling bitter about it. Well, Mamshred Federation wasn’t close to Quordentz’s territory, so for them to start a war immediately was unlikely.

「A few days ago, one of the travelers who returned from Mamshred Federation brought back a strange plant. The traveler said that the plant could be seen growing in every village that’s engaging in silkworms.」

「Hoh. If that can be used as a food for the silkworms, then the food problem would be solved, and we can expect some production.」

I recalled the silkworm on Earth ate only mulberry leaves, but the silkworms in this world weren’t picky eaters, and they would grow when fed with different kinds of food. There was a problem with raising the silkworms with only the plants provided nearby Nyuneri. The spies sent in Mamshred Federation seemed like they’d been doing their job well, so everything was good.

Afterward, they continued their report, and I gave them directions when necessary. As for the inspection of the production sites including the soap factory and silkworm shop which were located in the city’s agricultural area, I decided to do it on another day.

Finishing with the initial reports, I asked them the main reason why I came here.

「By the way, where is Eve?」

When I asked them that, the employees all wore a confused look.

「Eve…? I’m sorry, who is that?」

Surprisingly, they didn’t know the name of that outstanding beautiful elf girl. Were the men working here all impotent? 

「I’m talking about my slave, an elf girl. I heard from Tesh that she’s working here.」

Then, one of the employee’s clapped his hands.

「Oh, so that girl is Eve. Tesh-sama told us to call her slave, so we weren’t aware of her name.」

Apparently, all of the employees were referring to Eve as “slave”.

That reminded me, I gave Tesh the instruction to make things difficult for Eve. It was quite nasty of him to prepare an environment where no one would call her by her name and instead call her a slave. If she’d changed her attitude and become obedient, I would treat her gently.

「We’ve been informed that she is president’s slave. No one tried to make a move on her…」

「Then good.」

Once I finished asking them about Eve, I let the employees leave.

Letting out a breathe, I moved my lower half. It’s condition was looking good.

「Go and call Eve.」

When I gave that order, a servant at the side immediately left the room.

I slowly looked around the room. There were only a large sofa and a table and no bed. Well, there was no way there would be a bed in the president’s office. It was also troublesome to take her to my mansion. While I was thinking, someone knocked on the door.

「Enter.」

The door opened quietly, and a single girl entered the room.

Her amber hair hung down to her waist, and her deep green eyes gave the image of a deep forest. Her elf ears pointed to the side, and her skin pale white. She was wearing the kind of clothes that girls in the castle town would wear, and had ample breasts that didn’t match her age.

At the same time as my lower half got larger, her well-featured face turned into a grimace. 

Her expression was filled with surprise and terror.

Chapter 43: Deliciously Eating the Elf Slave Who Chose to Submit (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I looked at Eve who was standing still in front of the opened door. Her plain clothing and her exquisitely delicate face were so unbalanced that it was amusing. 

「Stop standing there and close the door.」

「… Yes.」

Eve walked nervously, looking afraid. 

Then, she closed the door slowly, so much that it was obvious that she didn’t want to close it. 

A low thud sounded inside the room.

I turned my eyes towards the guards and maids in the room.

「Step back.」

 「Yes.」 

They all walked pass Eve who was standing near the door and left the room. I could clearly see that Eve was afraid now that she was alone with me in the room.

「Come here.」

「Yes…」

She slowly walked closer, and stood in front of me as I sat down on the sit of my super luxurious president’s desk. Considering our position, I was the boss receiving a report from a subordinate. In my case, I was a sexual harasser boss.

「Um…」

I was just about to order Eve to remove remove her clothes, but I didn’t expect that she’d speak first.

I quietly waited for her to continue.

「I, I’m very sorry for rejecting M-Master’s favor…」

「Hm?」

「Please forgive me… I’ll endure it and I won’t disobey Master again… Please forgive me…」

Saying that, Eve kneeled down and placed her fingers on the carpet.

I could see her fingers shaking and body slightly trembling when I leaned slightly forward from my seat.

「How admirable.」

She probably had it really tough in this one and a half month that I’d been gone. Incidentally, a year in this world was equivalent to 360 days, and there were 30 days for each month, so it was easy to understand.

When I glanced sharply at her, she began to tell the the reason for her change of heart.

As a foolish slave who refused her master’s demand, Eve was despised by the people around her. They called her “slave” in a disgusted tone, and no one ever called her by her real name “Eve.”

When she told them that they shouldn’t call her slave because her real name was Eve, they looked down on her for being an impudent slave, and the hurtful whispers behind her back increased.

People clearly avoided her on purpose and pointed their fingers at her while sneering every time she walked through my mansion or the association’s building. There were some people who talked to her normally once in a while, but they immediately avoided her along with some hurtful words the moment they found out about her history.

She was scolded by the servants on how foolish she was, and was criticized for not reflecting enough on her past mistakes. There were occasions when a day passed without anyone talking to her, and Eve shed tears from the loneliness she felt. More than that, she became sad for feeling relieved that nobody spoke to her.

No one accepted her no matter what she did, and was instead despised and treated as a bother. She never received any physical punishment, but that only made her even more miserable.

In this one and a half month, that was roughly how her days went. That kind of environment was too cruel for a twelve-year-old girl. No wonder she was dejected.

Incidentally, Tesh mentioned that those employees who treated her normally at first and avoided her the next were arranged. He seemed to have arranged them to get her hopes up before knocking her down. Tesh, Savage!

「Please forgive me… I won’t disobey again… please forgive me… I can’t… take it… anymore… everyone’s… uhhh….」

Eve prostrated and placed her head on the ground to hide her tears. 

There was nothing I could do now that she’d prostrated on the ground. Her protruding soft bottom was lovely, so I forgive her. I had to show her some kindness here, or else she might hang herself somewhere.

「Eve.」

「… Yes!?」

It had probably been a while since someone called her name, Eve responded a moment late.

「I’ll accept your apology. Only this time, I’ll forgive your past impoliteness.」

Eve’s face brightened, and she looked upwards with her teary green eyes.

So cute!

I felt my lower half growing harder. Why was her beautiful tear-stained face this arousing? This made me want to make her cry even more.

I stood from my chair, and sat on the sofa prepared for guests.

「Come here.」

「Yes.」

Eve headed to the sofa with footsteps lighter than when she entered the room. She tried to sit on the sofa opposite me, so I stopped her with a hand.

「Sit on my lap facing me.」

When I told her to sit on me while patting my lap, Eve looked troubled. She’d probably been taught thoroughly by the servants about my status, so she might be thinking that it would rude to sit on my lap.

Pulling her arms, I forcibly sat her on my lap. Eve’s beautiful face was right before my eyes and her breasts pressed against my chest.

「Uh…」

The hint of smile on her face had disappeared without a trace, and in its place was disgust. As expected, she didn’t put it into words, but her body betrayed her.

Without pointing it out, I moved closer to her face.

「… No… mmhm……」

I started with a deep kiss.

I stirred Eve’s thin saliva and sucked it up. My erect penis was sticking into her crotch as though it wanted so badly to break through my clothes and enter her vagina.

「You kiss me this time.」

「Y-yes.…」

Eve kissed. She seemed to be trying her best to only touch my lips without going too deep with the kiss. To end her pointless effort, I moved my arms around her head and forcibly brought her face closer. 

 「mhmm… mwahh…?! mmhm…! mmhm… haa…..!」 

I forcibly seized her lips and sucked her tongue. Along with a kiss sound, I released her lips and looked at her eyes.

「Ahaa, do it like that, understand?」

「haa, haa… y-yes…」

Once more, Eve brought her face closer, and our lip overlapped. She seemed to have resolved herself this time, and slipped her tongue inside my mouth. As I teased her tongue and savored it, I moved the hand that was around her head towards her ass.

「 mwah… phaa… mmhm, mwah…」

Eve raised her body by a bit and began a deep kiss while sending her saliva down to me. Her flavor was being poured inside my mouth.

Is she finally getting into it? 

I thought, but she was probably pressing herself into me because she didn’t want to drink my saliva.

「…… Eve, you’re good at kissing. Let’s continue on.」

「… Yes.」

While being kissed by Eve, I extended my hand to her ass. She was wearing something similar to a long skirt, and I couldn’t find the opening to her skirt because she was sitting. It couldn’t be helped, so I touched her ass from above her clothes. I preferred a slightly bigger ass, but Eve’s ass was tight and it felt incredible. 

Trying to escape from my hands, Eve shook her ass to the sides, causing me to feel aroused because her action looked like she was inviting me in. I pulled her skirt up and found its hem, and then I slipped my hand inside. My fingers went over her fluffy underwear and finally arrived at her most important part.

「Noo… muah…」

Eve raised a lovely cry while she was kissing me, but I didn’t care about her and continued on. She wasn’t too wet, but perhaps because she was stimulated by the fact that I slipped my hand, I felt my hand gradually become wet while I was playing with her down there. It was amusing when Eve’s tongue quivered everytime I pressed and brushed my fingers on her clit while we were kissing.

When I tested it and inserted my middle finger inside, her warm flesh tightened on my finger. The feeling must be exceptional if I were to insert the real thing down there. I wanted to enter her so badly.

「Eve, let’s end the kiss here.」

「… y-yes.」

Eve replied with a joyful expression.

Oh… Seeing her joyful look, I wanted to be mean to her.

While Eve wiped her wet mouth with her sleeve, I showed a smile.

「Eve, put this inside you..」

I said, then unfastened my trouser’s button, and showed my hot dick.

Seeing my thing suddenly jump out, Eve’s expression stiffened.

「I’ll pour plenty of my seed inside you.」

Hearing my words, Eve’s expression twisted. That expression was the most adorable one that she showed today.

I felt my dick getting a level harder.

Chapter 44: Deliciously Eating the Elf Slave Who Chose to Submit (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Hearing my intention to impregnate her, Eve looked troubled on how to respond. My rock hard dick was looking for a place to go, and transparent fluids were coming out from the tip.

「Um… M-Master…? 」

「What is it?」

「…It’s… um…I’ll…get…pregnant…」

She was obviously racking her brain on how to refuse my order without angering me. Of course, I had no intention of letting her off.

「You don’t want to obey me?」

Startled, Eve was frozen to the spot.

She’d been treated coldly by the people around her because she was disobedient. Eve seemed to have noticed that refusing me here would repeat the same thing again.

「N-no… that’s not… it…」

「Is that so? Then go and put it inside you.」

I put strength into my dick and moved it forward and downward.

Eeeek!

Letting out a low cry, Eve held her breath.

「…… yes…」

Nervously, and with scared hand movement as though she was going to grab a snake, Eve’s white slender fingers touched the base of my penis. She turned her face away, avoiding to look as much as possible.

「Good, now insert it.」

She turned her skirt up with her other hand and positioned herself so that she could accept my dick. I released my hand from her crotch and helped Eve take her panty off. She was wearing a drawers-like panty, and as expected, it lacked the charm. Her string panty last time was better.

「Um… I’ll i-insert it…」

「Hm.」

Eve moved from a sitting to a half-standing position, so I couldn’t see her private part because it was covered by her skirt. I could feel that she was holding my dick, so she was probably going to insert it inside her by sitting down on my dick. Being unable to see it had instead made me feel more aroused.

Eve lowered her body down, and I could feel a wet sensation from the tip. She was moving her body to position my dick to her hole, causing my dick to rub into the lips of her vagina.

Even at this moment, I was about to erupt.

「……mmugghhh…!」

「… Ohhh!」

Spreading Eve’s flesh open, my dick made its way inside her warm body. This feeling was very pleasant. 

「Ugghhh…! uhhh…! mmhm…!」

She probably didn’t intend to make those sounds, but her voice as she endured the penetration was erotic. Only half of my dick had entered inside, so I had to be patient for now.

「mmhh! haa… haa…… mmhhh!」

Intending to end it with one last push, Eve dropped her body at one and inserted the entirety of my dick inside her. Completely in a sitting position, Eve relaxed and out a breath.

「This is good, Eve. You’re body is the best.」

Her vagina was squeezing hard on my meat stick, and it felt very hot and tight inside. I would surely cum If I were to move now. I calmed myself down by caressing her back and rubbing her ass. I wanted to appreciate the feeling as Eve squeezed on my dick.

「Ugghh……Uhhh……」

Eve looked like she was desperately enduring the pain from being penetrated, and she huddled her body while letting out an anguished cry.

I hugged Eve’s body.

「Eve, kiss me!」

「Ugghhh… y-yes…」

Since our height was more or less the same, Eve was positioned higher when in a face-to-face sitting position, and she was on top when we kissed. The fact that our lips, body, and our crotch were closely pressing against each other filled me with so much satisfaction.

「mhmwah! mwah…mwahh…」

Eve looked charming as she desperately continued kissing me with a pained expression. While making wet noises, Eve’s vagina tightened on my dick, begging for me to release my seed. I felt an even greater desire to stain her insides with my semen. The pleasant feeling accelerated and was heading upwards.

「Ohhh, I’m about to cum! Eve, take my seed!」

「Uhh……uuhh……!」

Tightly holding Eve’s ass, I pulled it closer with all my strength. I was intent on planting my seed deep inside her.

「Gu! Cumming!」

In great force, my semen gushed out towards Eve’s deepest area. My seed was seeking for her egg, and they continuously propelled forward. My ejaculation calmed down for a moment, and then rushed out again, staining Eve’s vagina in my color.

「Kuuu……」

I felt something warm on my thighs. Semen probably dripped out from inside Eve. Feeling that it would be waste to let it leak out, I grabbed Eve’s ass again and pulled it closer.

I wanted to impregnate her and fill her womb with my semen. Only that thought remained in my mind.

「Eve… hold me tightly.」

「……yes.」

Eve’s slender arms moved around my back, and hugged me weakly, and stiffly and then tightly as though she was at a loss. Being hugged by her, I felt a sense of relief, and the lingering feeling from an orgasm felt even pleasant. I left myself to Eve’s vagina as it did its best to squeeze out the remaining semen in my urethra.

I was filled with euphoria.

「Haa… Eve, that was good. I released plenty of my seed in you. 」

「……ahhh」

「Take off your top.」

Since she was wearing different clothes for her top and bottom, she could remove her top even while our crotch remained locked.

I supported her back to prevent her from falling, and waited Eve to finish undressing.

After taking her top off, she was wearing a hemp sleeveless t-shirt. Her bulging chest was standing out. Eve was still young, which caused it to stand out all the more, but I had to say that her breasts sure were big.

It was definitely bigger than Minith and Kohali’s, and only Anna probably had that kind of size at that age. As for the tea leaf girl, she was flat-chest, so there was nothing to compare.

「Now take your t-shirt off.」

「……Uh.」

After throwing off her t-shirt, her bare breasts were there, and her twin peaks entered my sight. Her nipples were light pink in color, and they resembled a fruit. I wanted to take a bite.

「mmu.」

「Eeeek.…」

Immediately, I sucked Eve’s breast, twisting my tongue around her pink nipples, making sure of its taste.

Soft and Delicious.

Last time, her nipples swelled because I was too engrossed in sucking them, so I decided to take my time and enjoy it this time.

I was engrossed in sucking her nipples. Even though there was no taste, my mind sensed it as very delicious. What was this sense of happiness within me?

Really, it was a pity that she had no milk.

「Ugghh… It’s getting… bigger… again… uhhh.…」

My dick which was still inside her body became erect for the second time. Pressured by the foreign thing inside her, Eve was finding it hard to breathe.

While sucking her breast, I enjoyed the feeling of her vagina as it moved and tightened around my dick.

「Aahh……uhh……mmh……」

I searched for Eve’s sensitive spots while playing with her down there. At the same time, my other arm also searched for the weak spots around her anus. While doing so, I enjoyed fondling and rubbing her body.

「Aahh! no…painful…stop.. there…stop… noo…ughh…」

Eve was still young, so perhaps her erogenous zones hadn’t yet developed. She was only voicing out her discomfort.

If I were to take my time and develop her body, she might start moaning from the pleasure very soon. This was the chance for me, as the president of the development association, to show off my skills. For the time being, I’d end it by letting her feel sexual stimulation. I could already feel my climax coming for the second time. Her breasts were great. They led me to my second orgasm in no time.

「Eve, I’ll cum one more time! Make sure to take it all!」

「…uhhaa.…」

Once again, my semen was poured inside Eve.

I pulled Eve’s tear-stained face closer and gave her a very deep kiss. I entwined my tongue with her warm tongue, licked it, and tasted its flavor. I could tell that loads of my semen had leaked out from her, and it soaked into the sofa.

It would be tough to clean that up.

While I thought about that, I enjoyed the lingering feeling after an orgasm.

Grabbing Eve’s hand, I entwined our fingers together.

「That was great. I’ll give you plenty of love from now on too, my Eve. 」

「……y-yes.」

Feeling slight affection for my sex slave who had gotten obedient, I licked Eve’s ears while her body was quivering.

「Aaaaaahhh?!」

A cry from Eve sounded near my ears. When I licked her ears over and over again, I could see that she got goosebumps on her neck, and her body was quivering nonstop.

I see, her ears was a sensitive part.

I would try to focus attacking her around the ears to warm her body up the next time we had sex. I swore firmly to myself.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 45: To the Army Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


After I had sex with Eve, I changed into the clothes that were prepared for me. Naturally, I had no intention to move around wearing clothes that reeked of semen.

I had the servants wipe my body with a wet towel and put on my clothes. Since they took the trouble to bring my clothes all the way here, my action seemed to be within their expectations. Incidentally, the servants seemed to be taking care of Eve in another room.

「Young Master.」

 「Tesh? For you to come all the way here, did anything happen?」 

Before I knew it, Tesh was already inside the room.

Since he usually stayed either at my residence or the castle, he rarely came here to the association’s building. He should’ve been waiting for orders at the castle today. Why did he come here?

「There’s a message from Master.」

「Hm? What is it?」

 「I received the instruction to prepare a new formal attire for Young Master. May I call the cloth merchant here?」  

Creating a set of clothes to wear for the nobles social party requred a considerable time to finish. My father probably predicted that a large party would be hosted very soon, and he must’ve judged that it would be better to prepare my attire immediately, so he sent Tesh here.

Of course, I had several sets of clothes, but I probably had to make a new one that matched with my current body measurements.

「Fine, I’m done with my important matter here anyway. But, is it okay to decide it on my own? I have to match my attire with Plume-sama, right?」 

The attire’s design and color needed to be matched with the female partner’s dress, especially for the dancewear. Single and unengaged nobles would usually choose a family member or a relative as their partner. In my case, my partner was my cousin Plume.

Plume was the daughter of my mother’s younger sister and the daughter of an earl who ruled the territory next to Quordentz’s. We’d known each since we were young, and she also lived at Nyuneri Castle for a period of time. We could be considered childhood friends.

Plume was currently back at her family’s territory, but we were still exchanging letters. I was confident that she would grow into a beautiful woman, so I continued exchanging letters with the intention of getting more closer to her. What a heart-touching effort!

She was most likely my dance partner this time too, so was it really fine to decide the attire on my own? However, Tesh seemed to have expected what I was thinking, and he quickly answered.

「There’s no problem. A letter regarding the attire that we’re going to make has already been sent to the Sylphia house.」 

Quordentz house was like the leader among the nobles in the surrounding area, so if we told them to match their attire with us, they would do so.

I usually matched my attire to Plume’s liking through letters, but it looked like we were in a hurry this time, and Father had already sent them the instruction. 

「If that’s the case, then its fine. Call the cloth merchant.」

「I understand.」

Tesh turned around and left the room.

Until now, I usually had this cloth merchant help me with many of my requests. When I wanted to make a personalized maid uniform back then, I also asked the people from this clothing company. Since someone was coming here, I might as well put forward my idea about the panty and bra and then have them make a sample. 



I was excited to see Eve and the others wear them on the bed. 



While smiling, I waited for the visit of the cloth merchant.

My body measurement ended without any delay. Tesh conveyed the details including the color and design as instructed in the note that he brought with him, so everything was well. 

When I explained about the panty and bra, the cloth merchant became quite interested, so I decided to leave it to them. Furthermore, I had fun watching Eve get her bust measured. I would have Minith’s three sizes measured later.

「Young Master, what’s your plan after this? 」

 The cloth merchant had left, and while I was taking an early lunch at the association, Tesh asked. 

  「I didn’t make plans, but I’m thinking of going to the army base. I want to check the condition of the soldiers who fought together with me in Nambonan.」  

Quordentz’s army remained in Nambonan City even now, but the other soldiers had returned to their respective army bases. A part of the 5,000 soldiers under my command was among the soldiers who returned to the army base in Nyuneri City. 

I was considering to drop by and provide the soldiers a drink money as a reward for their service. I intended to treat everyone for a drink with my own money, so it would cost quite a lot. Well, it was cheaper compared to buying a woman’s virginity in Nyuneri City, so the cost wouldn’t hurt my pocket by much. 

 「Young Master. The soldiers will be happier if they are given the real thing.」 

「Right. Young Master’s consideration will be conveyed better if they see the real thing.」 

When I explained that to Tesh, the surrounding guards gave me their advice. True, the impact would be greater if I were to bring in a barrel of alcohol rather than just giving them the money to buy one.

I ordered an idle servant to run to the liquor shop, and then I finished my lunch.

 「I’ve asked the liquor shop’s owner to bring in the alcohol to the base. They were already loading several barrels on the wagon by the time I left, so they might be on their way already.」 

「I see. Good work.」

Since Tesh would be returning to the castle, only my guards and some servants would accompany me to the army base. 

Nyuneri City was divided by the walls into three zones. From the outermost, they were: the city zone, the castle town, and the castle.

The army base was located in the city zone. The Innovation Association and my residence were located in the castle town. Other than the army base, the agricultural fields and the Innovation Association’s experiment facilities, as well as the various workshops, were located in the city zone.

In order to move from the Innovation Association to the army base, we would have to pass through the wall. Leaving behind a nervous gatekeeper, we headed to the base. The army base was only a few steps away after leaving the gate. 

Quordentz and Nyuneri’s armies weren’t the only ones stationed here. There were also nearby establishments such as prison and interrogation room for criminals. People who committed a crime in Nyuneri City were locked up there. For example, six adventurers walking together in the castle town would get arrested and then interrogated there for being suspicious. 

 「That reminds me, the six adventurers who were caught yesterday, are they still detained here?」 

I was slightly curious about the adventurer party, so I asked the base’s entrance guard. The guard seemed to know about them, and he immediately answered.

「Yes, they are still being interrogated!」

As one might expect from a world that resembled Middle Ages, their methods were very extreme. They would get the information out through force. Rather than calling it an interrogation, they might be getting tortured by now.

I got the feeling that two of them were women They were wearing loose robed-like clothing, so they were probably a woman.

「Hmm.」

I was slightly interested about them, but I’d released my load inside Eve just a while ago, so I was currently empty. Furthermore, I wanted to remain free from sexual desire right now, so I decided to pay them no attention for now.

It happened just when I thought that. 

I heard a voice from one of the small establishments near the base’s entrance.

「Hurry up and walk!」 

Turning to the direction of the shout, a soldier was pointing his spear towards someone and was forcing the person to walk. I glanced at the person who was being pointed at with a spear. That person seemed to be a member of the adventurer group from yesterday. The clothing was also the one I saw yesterday.

I didn’t detect anything with my detection magic, which meant that a magic seal had probably been applied to the person. While I was looking at them, the soldier holding a spear noticed us, and then he quickly adjusted his stance and spoke loudly. 

「Oh! Captain, you’ve come back!」

Calling me captain, he must be among the 5,000 soldiers entrusted to me in the Nambonan war. My adjutant and servants called me young master, but the ordinary soldiers referred to me as captain.

 「I’ve returned yesterday. I also bought an alcohol. Everyone will get their fair share later, so look forward to it. You guys fought well in Nambonan, so you can drink as much as you like.」 

「Thank you!」

Perhaps curious because the guard who’d been poking her with a spear had suddenly humbled himself, the adventurer looked here as well. The adventurer was a woman with a well-featured face. She gave off a cold impression, and it was probably because of her dark blue hair that gave the impression of the deep sea.

「Hm…」

I would describe her as a cold and elegant beauty, but unfortunately, she lacked the impact because she was short and flat-chested. Instead, her childishness and coolness gave a funny impression, and I’d say she was rather cute.

Noticing that I was looking at the female adventurer, the soldier raised his voice.

 「Woman! Your rude in front of Captain! Get on your knees!」 

「Uhh……!」

Kicked on the back of the knee, the female adventurer fell down with her hands on the ground. While I watched quietly, the woman quickly changed her posture and kneeled down.

「…… Sir, I’m sorry. 」

Indifferently, she apologized.

I understood that she was paying attention so that she wouldn’t offend me, but couldn’t she speak more politely? Well, I guess I shouldn’t expect that from an adventurer.

「What’s with that tone?! 」　

As expected, the soldier snapped. He was about to swing the back of his spear towards the woman, so I raised my hand and stopped him.

「Wait. Don’t beat her harshly. Her beauty will be ruined.」

「But…」

「She probably apologized sincerely. I forgive her.」

It would be different if she was slated for execution, but if not then there was no need to incur unnecessary hatred. This woman should be a magic user, and it wouldn’t be funny if she were to cause terroristic acts within the city. A commoner magic user wouldn’t amount to much, but the damage would be massive if she were to resort to guerilla tactics.

The soldiers would only feel nervous if I stayed here, so after encouraging them for a short while, I quickly turned back. While walking along the base, I looked at the soldier’s condition.

I finally returned to Nyuneri City yesterday, but I moved with a small group of elites. The 5,000 soldiers entrusted to me had returned to their respective bases slightly ahead before I returned. 

I would occasionally hear the soldiers calling captain. They must be the soldiers under my command who’d returned here ahead of me. 

The atmosphere here was cheerful. They returned alive from the war, so feeling relaxed was natural perhaps. I might’ve bought the drinks in just the right time.

I arrived in front of the building where the army base’s headquarters was located. The alcohol had already arrived, and they were currently arranging the barrels.

|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 46: The Female Adventurer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The drinks had been brought in, and the soldiers in the place began to drink down at once.

I was probably the only one worried whether it was alright for the army and public security to be so lenient towards drinking alcohol. When I noticed it, even my guards were drinking a bit. 

Still, everyone in the base couldn’t just gather at one place, so they were drinking together while chatting cheerfully at their respective posts. The lower ranked soldiers were distributing barrels of alcohol to the establishments and lodging houses within the army base.

This scene, drinking at their workplace during the day, made me remember the last work day of the year back when I was a salaryman in my previous life.

I walked aimlessly around the base and spoke to the soldiers who were drinking. 

「… That being the case, the adventurers are scheduled to be released for the time being. But, we’ll continue observing their movements.」

「Hmm.」

I listened to the soldier in charge of the torture—I mean, the soldier in charge of the interrogation. The adventurers seemed to have been judged as innocent for the time being.

The five members apparently passed everything to their leader, and there was nothing significant obtained even after interrogating them. Due to that, the leader of their group had been put under a thorough interrogation.

After one night of rigorous interrogation, they judged that the adventurers were really only wandering around the city without knowing the permitted number of adventurers that could group up. 

「We’ll continue the investigation for a bit more, but the leader is also scheduled to be released tomorrow morning. The other five have already been released ahead.」 

「I see.」

 「But, I’m surprised. Does Captain have an interest in adventurers?」 

This interrogation supervisor was apparently also a soldier under my command, and he referred to me as captain.

There were many young nobles who admired adventurers. Being able to live, fight, and travel the land as they wished. There were many young nobles who dreamed that kind of unrestrained lifestyle.

It would’ve been interesting if they had something like a system of using letters to rank the adventurers or a guild system around the world. Unfortunately, those things didn’t exist in this world, so I wasn’t really interested. Even though adventurers had an unrestrained lifestyle, it was risky and unstable. I’d rather play with cute girls as a noble from a marquis house. 

「Not at all. I only want to try entering the field once.」

「Field? I’ve entered the field once as part of the army’s clean-up operation, but it wasn’t that interesting inside.」 

Quordentz house would occationally lead an army and enter inside the field, a world of fog nested by monsters, to slay magical beasts. The field located near Nyuneri was a large scale type, and entering deep inside would require carriages packed with essential things such as food and weapon. He apparently accompanied them as the person in charge of the logistics.

 「Regarding the arrested adventurers, I heard that they’ve come here from the royal capital to enter the field near Nyuneri City. They look like a capable group. There are occasionally adventurers fans among the soldiers, and they recognized the leader of that party. They seem to be a well known group in the royal capital.」 

 「Hoh. They have six magic users in one party, so its not strange that they are well known.」 

「No. Apparently, their group originally had only two members. I heard that four members joined them recently, becoming a party of six. Looks like they’ve done well in pulling in the four rookies who were attracted by the official notice in the royal capital.」 

I wasn’t sure if it was last year, but several policies that supported the adventurers in slaying magical beasts were implemented within the territory of the Levios royal family, including the royal capital. I’d heard that many people were attracted by that, and they wished to become adventurers. 

Since they were originally a party of two, perhaps they didn’t even think much about the permitted number of magic users that could group up inside the city.

 「I’ve asked them about the route they’ve taken to come here from the royal capital, and they said that they passed through small towns and villages. That explains how they’ve been able to come here without encountering any problem.」 

「That makes sense.」

There weren’t many places with a magic detection formation set around the whole place like the one in Nyuneri City due to the expensive cost. A small town or a village naturally wouldn’t have one.

Finishing my conversation with the interrogation supervisor, I walked around the base again. I briefly showed myself to the soldiers who were drinking together here and there and praised them for their great work.

After I finished going around the base, I considered sitting somewhere to rest for a while, but I noticed a pair of eyes looking here. 

She had an indigo blue hair which looked as though dyed by the night sky. Her face was beautiful enough that it gave a cold feeling, and she had a short stature that completely didn’t suit her appearance.

It was the female adventurer who got pointed at with a spear. She should’ve been released from the interrogation already, so why was she still in here? 

 「Young Master, please be careful.」 

The guards drew their swords with a clang. Even though they heartily drank so much alcohol, their voices and movements were perfectly steady. They displayed the work of a professional. 

Seeing that she’d been noticed and we were on alert against her, the female adventurer fell into a panic. 

「What? Don’t you need something?」

Since she didn’t approach or run away, I called out to her. 

Then, perhaps she thought that I was granting her the permission to move closer, the female adventurer slowly approached and kneeled down right before me with her fingers except her thumb placed on the ground.

 「Sir, please release Mergin. We are not plotting anything. We are innocent.」 

I let out a breath, and spoke. 

「Who?」

That single word was aimed to ask ‘Who are you?’ and ‘Who’s Mergin?’, but it seemed that she only understood the former. 

「I’m Lupetta, an adventurer.」

After introducing herself, her face looked as though she’d already said everything that was needed to be said. If my guards at the side didn’t interrupt, I felt like we would’ve ended up staring at each other the whole time.

Hurriedly, Lupetta continued. 

 「Mergin is an adventurer and my companion… He’s still being interrogated.」 

Their party leader was apparently called Mergin. Lupetta probably hadn’t been informed yet that their leader was scheduled for release tomorrow morning. When I asked her why she directly appeal to me, she seemed to have considered me as an understanding high-rank officer after seeing that I stopped the soldier from hitting her earlier. She didn’t seem aware that I was the eldest son of the Quordentz house.

A capable magic user, even if the person was a commoner or a twelve-year-old boy, was most likely to hold an important post in the army. Lupetta probably thought that I was a magic user of common birth. Come to think of it, Anna had mistaken me for a mercenary leader back in Nambonan when I entered the bar for the first time. In short, misunderstandings like that happened often. 

 「Mergin is a very nice person. He won’t rebel.」 

Lupetta was talking about their leader’s good points in a matter-of-fact way. Even though she was speaking in a barely audible voice, I could clearly tell from her tone that she was very much in love with the leader. 

I see, she was deeply worried about her darling leader… 

「If you want to speak so fondly of him, why don’t you do it at the gallows?」

I couldn’t help but make a light joke after being affected by her love love aura. But, Lupetta seemed to have taken my words seriously, and her face immediately paled. Well, I guess being told “Please, to the gallows” by a higher up in the army was no laughing matter.

「……W-what about Mergin?!」

「Let’s end this conversation here. Wait for the judgement.」

I was about to walk past her side, but Lupetta hastily stood up and moved right in front of me before kneeling down again. Then, she prostrated. 

 「Sir… I beg you, please spare Mergin. Without him, I… 」 

Down on her knees, Lupetta took a deep breath, and stared at me with her beautiful silver eyes. 

 「Please release Mergin. I’ll do anything I can.」  

The tears on her eyes fell down her face. 

I felt like my body had started producing semen at a rapid pace. Somehow, I had the feeling that I would recover enough to shoot out a lot by tonight. 

I’d go with this scenario: After partying at the army base, I didn’t feel like going back to the castle anymore, so I decided to spend the night at my residence.

I told Lupetta to visit my residence tonight. She looked like she understood the meaning behind my words, and she quietly agreed.

Chapter 47: Deliciously Eating the Female Adventurer in Love (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


After I finished eating dinner, Tesh approached me. 

「Young Master, the female adventurer has arrived. The preparations after this are underway.」 

「Good.」

Adventurers and travelers normally wouldn’t take a bath frequently, and that seemed to be the case for Lupetta, too. I would’ve considered it a reward instead if a cute girl had a bit of body odor. However, in Lupetta’s case, it was just too heavy. When I went close to her earlier, she smelled so bad that it made me think that perhaps she only wiped her face.

I gave the servants the strict order to throw her in the bath as soon as she arrived. Lupetta was probably covered in bubbles from the highest-class soap made in Nyuneri at this moment.

「I’ll go to my room. Lead her there once the preparations are done.」

「I understand.」

I proceeded to my room while patting my erect lower half which had fully regained its strength. Closing the door to my room, I was the only one inside. The servants who normally served me inside the room had already left. 

While waiting, I read the document that Eve had copied at the Innovation Association. Shortly after, there was a knocking sound. The number of knocks was different from the servant’s, so this person was probably Lupetta. She was knocking the door too much. 

「Enter.」

Upon receiving my permission, a woman quietly entered the room. 

It was Lupetta. 

The expression on her face was as dark as her hair, but there weren’t any tears in her eyes. She stared at me while holding a wooden box the size of a matchbox in front of her chest. 

The dirt had been washed off after taking a bath, and her smooth and clear dark blue semi-long hair swayed gently. Lupetta would qualify as a wealthy family’s young lady with her elegant appearance as long as she kept quiet.

The light green babydoll dress that balanced well with her petite body was probably prepared by the servants. Her dress which was made to wrap a woman’s mounds had become useless due to her flat chest, and it instead made her small breasts stand out. 

「Um…」

Closing the door, and after taking a few steps forward, she spoke. She seemed to be inquiring whether it was alright to speak, so I prompted her to continue with a hand.

「… Um, I want to confirm one thing. Sir, What’s… Do you have a high position in the army? Can you… Could you intervene in the matter concerning Mergin’s punishment?」 

She was allowed to take a bath and wear an erotic dress, and now she was standing in front of a man who was totally ready for action. That wasn’t really the kind of question you’d ask at this point, I thought. But, I nodded my head.

 「… Then, I’m glad. Sir, you own a large house like this one. What’s… Are you an army executive, or something? 」

She was probably probing my status to see if I really had the authority to release Mergin. Ignoring her question, I decided to go straight to the point.

「Mergin is scheduled for release tomorrow morning. It has been decided just a while ago.」

“Just a while ago” referred to a little while before she pleaded by offering her body to me. Of course, I wouldn’t tell her the truth. 

「Ah… I’m glad. Thank you, Sir.」

Lupetta let out a relieved breath and relaxed. She probably loved Mergin very much. For her to sacrifice her body in order to save her loved one, how admirable and adorable. I would definitely have to do my best to shower her with love.

「Isn’t still too early to thank me? What will happen if you break our promise… Do you understand?」

The answer: Nothing would happen. 

「I know. I’ll definitely keep… our promise. 」

Completely ignorant of the truth, Lupetta looked at me with a stiff expression. 

Our promise was simple. She would be my prostitute while their adventurer group carried out their activity in Nyuneri City. I arranged the promise in a way so that I would be able to bang her again in case her body was good. Even though she did it for Mergin, it was Lupetta’s fault for immediately agreeing to the promise without properly asking for the details.

「We have plenty of time. Come and sit here, and let me know more about you.」

「… Okay.」

Lupetta walked in a strange manner while looking here, and sat down on the bed. She seemed to have placed the small box on the nearby table. I stored the document on my hand inside the desk’s drawer. 

「Name?」

「Lupetta.」

She gave me a doubtful look as if to say “You already know my name, right?”. 

I intentionally let out a deep breath. 

  「… I’m not only asking about your name, I want to know more about you. In simple terms, introduce yourself.」  

Lupetta gripped her hands which were placed on her lap into a  グ shape and while looking diagonally upwards, she spoke.

「Err, I’m Lupetta… I was born in Vairburg village, and seventeen years old this year. I’m an adventurer.」

「Seventeen years old?」

Simply looking at her face, she kind of look like a seventeen-year-old woman. However, she was shorter than me, a twelve-year-old boy. Despite wearing a sexy babydoll dress that emphasized the body line, there were no curves to be seen from her body. She didn’t look like a seventeen-year-old woman.

「I get… They often tell me that my body is undeveloped.」

Lupetta appeared to be having trouble with her speech since a while ago. She seemed confused with her speech. Maybe she wasn’t used to speaking with a person of high status.

Elluo, the general language in this continent, was similar to Japanese. It had a wide variety of expressions, including polite speech. Lupetta seemed to believe that she was being respectful, but she would definitely be taken to the discipline room if Tesh were to hear her speak.

「You’re having quite the trouble speaking.」

 「… I have never talked to a person of high status. In the village, I’m the one with the highest status…」 

I had no idea where Vairburg or something village was located, but magic users were quite rare in small villages. She must’ve grown up doing as she pleased.

「I’ll permit you to speak normally. However, you’ll have to promise to talk that way only when we are together alone.」

「… Really?」

「Yes. It will throw me off if you keep fumbling with your words. However, never speak casually when outside.」

No one would hear Lupetta even if she were to speak casually in the bedroom. There were probably servants and guards listening through the wall, but they weren’t so senseless as to meddle with bed matters. 

「… Got it. I’ll speak properly outside.」

「Good. Be sure to watch out.」

I slowly moved closer to the bed. 

「Well then, I’ll have you stick to your promise.」

「… Alright.」

I sat down closely beside Lupetta who was sitting down on the corner of the bed. She was seventeen years old, but her height was about the same as Eve who was only twelve. I thought about comparing their breast size, so I reached my hand towards her dress’ breast area. I could feel her warmth under the silk dress.

「Mergin…」

Much to my surprise, she was totally flat-chested. Her dress formed a beautiful straight line from her chest to her stomach, as though she didn’t have any swelling part anywhere.

Lupetta seemed to be in love with Mergin, but if Mergin was a breast man, she would have to give up her hopeless love

「Being touched by a man other than your much loved Mergin, how does it feel?」

「…… The worst.」 

I did tell that she could speak to me normally, but I never told her that she could speak so bluntly. Well, in some sense, this was a fresh experience. I decided to enjoy her cheeky mouth.

「Have you done this kind of thing with Mergin? 」

 「No way… Mergin and I aren’t in that kind of relationship.」 

「I see. Mergin hasn’t touched you. Hmm.」

From above the clothes, I touched her completely flat and smooth chest. I felt like I was leaving my footsteps on the new snow of a ski resort completely reserved by another person. I was getting aroused.

「mmh… no, it tickles! stop it… mhm…」 

Lupetta’s breathing became somewhat disordered when I stimulated her around her nipples. Turning her body around, I fondled her breasts from behind. When I gave her a loud kiss on the neck, I could hear a low cry from her.

 「You’re really cute, Lupetta. Even though you were so close to him, it’s hard to believe that he didn’t touch you.」 

「… You’re lying.」

Lupetta had a loli body, but she was quite attractive. Since Mergin hadn’t touched her, perhaps he really was a breast man.

「Mergin has only been looking at that girl recently… After all, I’m… 」

Apparently, Mergin was enamored with the new female adventurer in their team. That woman didn’t come to plead for Mergin. She probably went back to Nyuneri City immediately after being released. What a heartless woman. 

「Even though we’ve been together for a long time… When we came here in Nyuneri, that woman…」 

While I responded appropriately to Lupetta’s complains, I lowered the shoulder string of her babydoll dress. She seemed to have built up a considerable amount of resentment from her days, and perhaps she was feeling pleased that someone was listening to her, Lupetta gradually became talkative. There was probably no one in their party who would hear out her complains. However, she shouldn’t grumble about these things to the person who demanded her body.

For a short while, Lupetta continued grumbling her dissatisfactions towards Mergin and “that woman”. 

 「Mergin won’t even look at me… He doesn’t need to tell me, I know that I’m not attractive… He’s too much… Even though I’m having a hard time now…」

「… I have a question. How old is Mergin?」

「Fifteen years old.」

Hearing Lupetta’s grumblings since a while ago, a doubt had surfaced in my mind, that perhaps Mergin might actually be in love with Lupetta. Maybe he was trying to attract Lupetta’s attention by calling another woman beautiful, teasing Lupetta about her body, and intentionally showing that he had no interest in her.

He was giving off the smell of a cherry boy who would tease his crush. He probably awakened his love towards the older and sisterlike Lupetta, but he couldn’t be honest with his feelings due to their relationship up until now. Lupetta was completely oblivious of a man’s feeling, and she took his words at face value and got hurt. Of course, I wouldn’t point it out. 

 「I see, that’s indeed too much. Even though you love him so much that you’re willing to offer your body to another man.」 

「Stop it. Dont’t say such thing… 」

While rubbing her breast, I was slowly pulling down her dress’ shoulder string. I was secretly brushing her hair, but I stopped my hand and instead pressed it on the back of her head and then tightly embraced her closer.

「I’m only telling the truth. You will be having sex with me, and I’ll be taking your beautiful body which no one has seen before. If Mergin finds out about this matter, what will he think? Will he feel sad? angry? or perhaps… he won’t care?」  

 「Stop it, don’t say anything! I don’t want to hear it… For his sake, I… No, I’ve had enough… Please hurry up and finish it.」 

I repeatedly kissed her on the neck, and then removed her babydoll dress. Wearing only a string panty, Lupetta’s almost naked figure appeared in sight. Like the time with Eve, there was a servant in my residence with a good sense, preparing a sexy dress and string panty for my woman. I’d decided to give that servant a special bonus later.

Moving before Lupetta, I placed my fingers under her chin and turned it upwards. Lupetta seemed to have understood my intention, and she stiffened slightly.

「Uh… um.」

「What is it?」

Moving my face slowly closer, I asked. 

「Can we do it without kissing? Please.」

「That’s not included in our promise, but… I guess its fine. However, I won’t allow any further requests. If you refuse me again, not only will I kiss you, but I also won’t be able to guarantee what will happen to Mergin.」

Smiling slightly, Lupetta nodded. 

I didn’t really mind even if we didn’t kiss now. There were still many chances to sleep with her again. Besides, I felt like it would interesting to see her reaction if I forcefully kissed her during our last day. At her moment of carelessness because she was thinking that it would be our last time, I would give her a surprise deep kiss. Without doubt that would be her last as well as her greatest memory as a prostitute in Nyuneri City.

「Thank you.」

In the first place, I would be cumming inside her very soon, so why was she so happy just because we weren’t going to kiss?

A woman’s heart was complicated.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 48: Deliciously Eating the Female Adventurer in Love (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I drew my face away and observed Lupetta’s body. Her nipples, color slightly darker than her skin, were erect. It must’ve been because I teased her nipples earlier while listening to her complains. 

「If you don’t want to kiss then it can’t be helped. Here, lick this.」 

I held out my dick right in front of Lupetta. Since she’d already rejected the kiss earlier, she couldn’t reject anymore. Lupetta hesitated for a moment, but she stuck out her tongue as though she’d resolved herself.

 「Have a taste of your first cock.」 

Her trembling tongue reached the tip of my aroused penis. When it touched right where my transparent fluids had gathered, she pulled her tongue back in surprise.

「Lick it properly! Hold it inside your mouth and taste it from top to bottom.」 

I thrust my hips forward and shoved my penis towards her cheek. She closed her eyes with a frown and then brought her face closer with her mouth wide open. Lupetta’s angle was slightly off since she had her eyes closed, so I adjusted my dick with my hand and pushed it.

「Mmgg?!」

 「Good. Just like that, gradually close your mouth.」 

「Fmm…」

Lupetta obediently obeyed my instruction and closed her mouth. However, there was barely any feeling. Unlike the time when Minith gave a blowjob, it lacked the pleasant sensation like when the interior of the mouth was firmly holding the dick.

I sensed that she was putting air into her mouth, keeping a distance from my meat stick to avoid her mouth’s interior from touching it.

「Release the air inside your mouth and properly hold my dick with your mouth.」

「Mmfu…」

As the sound of air getting released sounded, I became enveloped in something warm. Her tongue, which was trying to get away, was positioned under my penis, while her mouth supported both sides. The hardness of her teeth, which were slightly rubbing against my dick, gave a good accent. It felt incredibly great.

 「Ohh, you’re doing an excellent job. Just like that, suck it and try out its taste. It’s the taste of your first dick, so remember it well.」   

Her tongue, placed under my dick, first wriggled about restlessly. Then, her mouth began moving with a sense of unity, getting a taste of the thing inside it.

「mmhu… mnh …chu… fuu… mhnhchu… mhmm…」

Lupetta teased the meat stick in her mouth with wet noises. The purpose this time wasn’t for me to feel good, but to let her familiarize herself with the taste of my cock. This feeling of having my body tasted by another person made my mind tremble from pleasure.

「Ahh, Lupetta. You’re so good. 」

「mmh… mmh, nnnhhu, mmh…」

Lupetta sucked my dick with a very disgusted look on her face. Her expression was very irresistible. Lupetta had a man who she desperately wanted to protect, but what she was doing right now was sucking another man’s dick. This gap brought the greatest pleasure.

「Lupetta, I’m going to cum.」

I wanted to teach her not only the taste of my dick but also the flavor of my semen. The moment I thought of that, I had reached my limit.

「mmh?!」

 「Familiarize yourself with the taste of my semen. Drink everything!」 

I sensed that Lupetta lowered her head to get away, so I grabbed the back of her head. And then, feeling stimulated by her soft and flexible hair, my arousal was pushed up at once.

「Ku! I’m c-cumming, Lupetta!」

「Uhhhh?! mmhnguu?!」

The semen rushed out on to her tongue and spread inside her mouth. From the indescribable groan coming from deep inside Lupetta’s throat, it was clear how much she was suffering.  

On one hand, she was receiving the worst suffering. On the other hand, I was immersed in a deep feeling of release as well as dominance. I was engraving my mark on her.

「There’s still more, so make sure to drink all of it! You’re not allowed to spit it out!」

I placed my hand under Lupetta’s chin and forcefully closed her mouth which she was trying to open. 

My meat stick continued letting out semen.

「mmmh, mhhhu, mhhhuuu.」 

When the ejaculation finally ended, I heard a gulping sound. I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction from the fact that she swallowed my semen.

「mmmggg!」

However, the moment she released my softened meat stick, Lupetta covered her mouth with a hand. Then, she curled her body with her hand holding her stomach all the while shaking. It looked as though she was about to vomit.

「Ah?! C-calm down! Don’t throw up here, you here me?! Are you alright?! Hey! Calm down!」

I couldn’t help but reveal my emotion in panic. I brushed Lupetta’s trembling back and took the decorative vase near the bed and readied it near her mouth.

 「If you’re going to throw up, then do it here. I won’t get mad, so don’t worry. Are you alright?」 

「Ugghh… ugghh… gross…!」

I gently brushed her back. This vase was actually quite expensive, and it wasn’t the kind that should be used to vomit in, but it was much better rather than in the bed or carpet.After gently brushing her back for a while, perhaps no longer feeling as nauseous, her trembling back had calmed down. 

I patted myself in relief that she didn’t make a mess.

「Phew, you surprised me!」

「….. Sorry.」

I felt like my softened dick had become limp.

 「… But, I swallowed all of it… so… please forgive me.」 

Lupetta opened her mouth widely and showed that there was nothing left inside. It made one wonder how she could still say that when she wanted to vomit it so much just a while ago.

I made Lupetta shut her mouth which reeked of semen and patted her head.

 「I’ll forgive you for almost vomiting. Tell me, how’s the taste of your first man?」 

 「… It was gross… I, I don’t want this, anymore…  」 

A tear fell down.

That scene appeared very mystical and beautiful.

「I can’t take this anymore… Why, am I doing this kind of thing… Mergin, you blockhead.」

「Right. Mergin really is an idiot. Even though he already has a thoughtful and loving woman beside him, he’s still looking at another woman.」

 「Stupid… Mergin…stupid… you always say bad things about me… even though I’ve always loved you… you’re horrible… save me… I, can’t take it anymore.……」 

 「Mergin sure is a heartless man. I really feel bad for you.」 

As the cause of all this, I shouldn’t really be saying all these stuff, but I didn’t mind it and hugged Lupetta’s body closer. I unfastened her string panty and threw it down the bed. Now, both of us were completely naked.

「Uhhh… enough… I don’t, care anymore… Mergin, idiot… idiot…」 

I placed Lupetta on the bed while she was getting all worked up complaining by herself. I grabbed her legs and spread it. There was almost no resistance, so I was able to fully unveil it without difficulties. Rather than saying that she’d resolved herself, it felt more like she’d already given up. But, for me, it didn’t really matter either way.

I gazed at Lupetta’s private area, which had a fair amount of pubic hair. I felt the mysteriousness of the human body upon seeing that she had pubic hair growing despite her childish body.

I brought my face towards her private area, which was covered by pubic hair, and then the smell of soap gently drifted. Even when I brought my nose close to her vagina, the smell of soap was still stronger. The maids in the bath must’ve cleaned her thoroughly down there.

I stuck out my tongue and pushed it against her clit.

「Hyaa?!」

I licked around her pussy like a dog. It tasted slightly salty.

While lying down on the bed facing up, she was trying to get away with her legs. 

After restraining her legs with my arm to make sure she wouldn’t escape, I continued stimulating her clit. I occasionally slid my tongue inside her and savored the heat inside.

「Ahh! No, what is this?! I’m feeling weird! Ah, not there! No!!!」

If you say so, then I would have no choice but to further stimulate that area. That’s a man’s job.

I focused licking around that area where Lupetta reacted.

「Noo aah, aaah! n-not there, ah, aah, aaah. aahh ahhh… not, there, ahhh…」

She was quite interesting since she was reacting honestly. She sounded like a musical instrument, an instrument that lets out lovely moans whenever played with the tongue. I found it funny, as there might actually be an instrument with her name.

「What’s the matter? You’re letting out quite a lovely voice.」 

「That’s, that’s not it! It was just a little!」

What exactly was just a little?

Even though it was so obvious due to her honest reaction, I still felt extremely happy for being able to please a woman.

「Isn’t it good that you’re enjoying it? Mergin’s going to be released, so he’s happy. You’re feeling good, so you’re happy. I’m able to sleep with a lovely woman like you, so I’m happy. See? We’re all happy.」

What a fine conclusion. This was a perfectly happy ending for all of us. In order to reach this happy ending, I once again slipped into her crotch and ran my tongue.

「 Ah, ahh. Ah, aaah, ah. Aahh, aahh, aaaah, n-noo, not, there, nooooo! 」

Her vagina had loosen up so much that I couldn’t tell anymore whether these transparent fluids was my saliva or her nectar.

I judged that her body was ready. My penis had also re-energized thanks to the bewitching sounds that she played. 

It’s all ready.

「I’m going to enter. You’re not allowed to refuse.」

  Considering our current position, we’d be having sex in a missionary position. I regretted promising that I wouldn’t kiss her. I’d realized that the best part of the missionary position was connecting with the other person with a passionate kiss. I considered breaking the promise and just suck her lips.  

「Uhhh… hurry up… finish it already… Mergin… you idiot… I’ve become weird… I don’t want this anymore.」

However, she covered her face with a pillow and was trying to endure the act that was about to begin

I’d save the kiss for next time.

「I’m going in.」

With the tip covered in pre-cum, I turned my dick towards Lupetta’s entrance.

Chapter 49: Deliciously Eating the Female Adventurer in Love (Part 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I moved my penis, as though tracing the lips of her vagina like a writing brush. While I savored the slippery sensation, I went closer little by little towards her hole. Since Lupetta was hiding her face with a pillow, I couldn’t see her lovely face. 

「Lupetta. Who is your first man?」

「Uuuhh…」

She didn’t respond, so I brought my face near her ear and whispered the same question one more time.

 「Lupetta. Who is your first man?」 

「Ahh, don’t know… I don’t know… it’s Mergin’s fault… why, why am I… why…」

It’s not that she didn’t know, but more like she didn’t want to admit it. Lupetta expressed her unwillingness while shedding tears.

「Hurry up and finish it… finish it… I don’t want this… I want to go home… I’ve become weird… I’m scared… be gentle to me…」

Muffled heartrending cries sounded from beyond the pillow. Her determination to continue on, sacrificing her body despite hating it so much, was truly praiseworthy.

I decided to stop being mean.

「Leaving aside whether I will end it quickly, I’ll treat you gently.」

After confirming the angle of my meat stick on her entrance, I dropped my body from on top of her. Her inside was quite soft, but even so, it was tight and narrow. I continued entering, forcibly breaking in as though cutting through it. It was so narrow and tight that I couldn’t feel where her symbol of virginity was. It took some time before I was able to enter inside her completely. Both Lupetta and I were breathing roughly.

「Arghh… it, it, hurts… uhh, hurry up… please…」

It would be a waste to end it so soon, so I held myself back and stopped moving. As though a switch had been turned on the moment I buried my whole inside her, Lupetta’s body had started entwining, as though seeking for my sperm. The inside of Lupetta’s vagina had tightened so much as though it wanted to receive my sperm. It was burning hot inside, and there was a rough feeling from it. My mind had already been moaning from the feeling.

Even though I was staying at rest, the pleasure was so great that I was about to lose my consciousness. I really wanted to move my hips and appreciate her body, but I could feel that I would ejaculate the moment I move. It would be all over if I were to move.

「Lupetta… aah…」

I noticed something when I called out her name. My mouth had been hanging half open without me noticing it, and saliva was dripping. My brain had placed its focus completely on my lower half due to the pleasure. I felt like I would turn into a disabled person if I were to remain like this.

「Aren’t, you done yet…? hurry, hurry up… no… I don’t want this…」

Lupetta, who had her face covered by a pillow, peeked with one eye. Her moist silver eye stared here. I felt the urge to kiss her lips and take away everything that she wanted to offer to her loved one.

「nnm.」

She covered her eye, which had been staring here, by a pillow again when I brought myself closer. It had become completely hidden from view. It seemed that she had easily seen through my evil intentions. She was totally on guard.

「Oh well.」

I very much love to push my hips while kissing, but there was no helping it this time, so I could only forget about it. Instead, I played with Lupetta’s utterly defenseless body, other than her face.

Usually, after inserting it, I would just thrust and kiss then it’s over. So I had never done something like caressing the other person in this kind of situation.

「You’re skin is really beautiful.」

I felt her flawless stomach. As expected from an adventurer, she had muscles underneath her smooth skin. Her healthy and strong body was excellent.

I kissed Lupetta around her neck and collarbone area. I ran my fingers down our connected private parts and poked her weak spot rhythmically. Slippery fluids covered my hand, making me wonder if semen had flooded out from inside her.

「Aah ahhh… aahha… stop, it, already… no… noo… mm… ah… ah, aaah… uhhh… Mergin…」

「What do you want me to stop?」

As I asked her that question, I peeled the skin of her clitoris and pressed the ball of my finger against it. Then, she squeezed the pillow she’d been hugging harder.

「T-that… stop…! don’t be gentle… noo… nmm! ahh, aaah?! nnm…!」

Lupetta bent backward to a shocking degree when I teased her clit, causing me to feel excited. I see. Lupetta didn’t want to be treated gently. Then I would have to treat her even gentler. With a sweet gentle tone,  I moved my mouth close to her ear and softly whispered:

「Lupetta, you’re lovely. You’re really lovely. The loveliest of all.」

I gently brushed her indigo hair with my other hand that wasn’t covered with love fluids. Not being recognized as a woman by Mergin seemed to be her inferiority complex, so I only had to focus my words around that part.

You’re lovely. 

You’re a charming woman

No man wouldn’t notice such a wonderful woman like you.

As I tossed words that satisfied her self-confidence, I kissed her body and stimulated her private area.

「… uhh, you’re lying… no… stop it…uuuhh… ah, there… nmm… lies, don’t say it…」

Lupetta was really a charming and attractive woman, but she just wouldn’t believe it. Her body was kind of childish, but its excellent condition was plain to see when I held her body. Honestly, I didn’t want to let her go. Forget about my dick, she even grasped my heart.

「I’m telling the truth. I’ve fallen in love with you since the first time we met.」

「Aah… nm, uhh, lies…」

「The reason I saved you back when the soldier almost hit you was because I was charmed by you.」

「Uuhh…」

Probably remembering our first chance meeting, Lupetta became silent without being able to deny my words.

「In the first place, I wouldn’t have accepted your request if you weren’t such a lovely woman. The fact that your sleeping with me right now is the best proof. You’re a lovely woman.」

I kissed her cheek and looked at her. Even though she avoided my gaze, she no longer said that my words were lies. As though mulling over my words, she squeezed the pillow. Additionally, my meat stick was also squeezed. The intense feeling of pleasure rocked my mind.

「Ku! I’m about to cum. Lupetta! I’m cumming!」

「… nmm…?! No! No!!!」 

During the first shot, a lump of semen rushed out. Following the first shot, semen continued rushing out in minute amount. It felt as though my semen had tainted even the feelings that Lupetta had towards Mergin deep within her heart with a sticky white color.

Lupetta’s seductive moans as she received my semen was captivating.

「Lupetta…」

While I was immersed in pleasure, all the energy I had was focused on ejaculating. I didn’t even have the strength to lift the pillow from Lupetta’s face. I embraced Lupetta’s head along with the pillow and planted a kiss on the pillow. The only thought I had was for my kiss to reach Lupetta’s moist lips behind this soft pillow.

Chapter 50: Deliciously Ate the Female Adventurer in Love
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Lupetta had squeezed out all the leftover sperm. We were still attached to each other, with my softened dick inside her.

「Lupetta, that was great.」

「… hah…」

As she replied weakly, I continued caressing her lightly. I wonder how much time had passed. The moonlight that shined from the gaps of the curtain had become faint. It seemed to be getting late. 

Today, I came twice inside Eve during the day and twice inside Lupetta during the night. I felt like I could still shoot one more time, but I decided not to overdo it.

Lupetta’s reactions were interesting, so I found it enjoyable sleeping with her. From now on, I would start treating her nicely and praise her to the skies. Then perhaps she would become proactive on the bed next time.

「I’m pulling it out.」

As I pulled my penis out, a slightly foamy white fluid oozed out, running down her anus, and staining the bed sheet. Lupetta looked erotic as she lay down on the bed with her legs opened in an M pose while semen continued leaking out from her.

「Wanna sleep now?」

「Ah… wait… I need to, do that.」

Lupetta wiped the semen dripping down from her crotch in a rough manner. What a waste. Afterward, she slowly crawled out from the bed.

While I looked at her wondering what she was going to do, she took a wooden box on top of a nearby table. That was the box that she brought with her back when she entered the room.

「What is that?」

「Can I… use this?」 

Lupetta asked. Then, she turned the box here. 

I stood up from the bed, took the box from her, and looked at the content inside. 

There was a pink powder inside the box. It looked like the soap powder that removes oil stains in Japanese gas stations. 

「What is this?」

I asked again.

She seemed to have thought that I would recognize it upon seeing the pink powder, but I really had no idea. 

「Eh…? It’s a medicine made from killsieshi, though?」

Killsieshi was a type of plant that was similar to aloe. The agricultural area in Nyuneri City also grew these plants. The leaf’s color was shocking pink. I heard that these plants were cultivated for decorative purposes.

「Is it a popular medicine? I haven’t heard of it, though…」

It was a medicine, but the wooden box didn’t have any manufacturer’s name on it, and it looked like an ordinary accessory box.

「Um… this is… a contraceptive… is it not used in the Quordentz army?」

What! Contraceptives actually existed in this world. I’d always thought that internal ejaculation was the norm and that the only way to prevent pregnancy was by ejaculating outside.

Who was it who told me that killsieshi was only an ornamental plant? Now that I think about it, I’d never seen nobles and wealthy families use them as decoration in their houses. The level of culture in this world wasn’t high enough that ordinary people would buy ornamental plants. They wouldn’t possibly use several fields to cultivate such an unprofitable thing, right? As I thought hard about it, I kind of remember that the one who taught me such a lie was my grandfather. Perhaps it was a training to demotivate me from using contraceptives. 

「Contraceptive, huh. Such thing actually existed. So, how do you use it?」

「It’s my first time… using it, too.」

Well yeah. I couldn’t think of a scenario where a virgin would use a contraceptive. While I quietly looked at Lupetta, she took a cup placed nearby.

「Can I use this?」

After I shook my head in approval, Lupetta grabbed around one teaspoon of the pink powder with her fingers. She then placed the powder into the cup and poured a small amount of water from the water container.

「Hoh.」

Lupetta dipped her finger inside the cup and mixed it. Afterward, the powder dissolved in the water, turning into a sticky liquid. After a while, it turned into something like pink gelatin. Lupetta then scooped that pink gelatin with her finger and entered it in her vagina. She seemed to have inserted her middle finger inside, but from an outsider’s point of view, she looked as though she was masturbating. It was a lewd sight.

「mm… nmm…」



Lupetta pulled out her finger, then she once again scooped the pink gelatin and thrust it inside. She repeated the same action until she emptied the cup.  





After folding her handkerchief and wiping her crotch one last time, she blocked the entrance of her vagina by wearing a panty to prevent the pink gelatin from leaking out. She seemed to have finished her pregnancy prevention treatment.



「Hah…」

As though finishing a task, Lupetta sighed.

I gently placed my hand on her shoulder.

「Come over here. There’s a clean bed.」

After getting out of the bed once, I couldn’t get myself to return to that bed where we had sex and was now covered in semen. I instructed the servant to prepare two beds this time too, so I invited Lupetta towards the unused bed. When I tried to hold her hand casually, there was almost no resistance from her.

Facing each other on the bed, I embraced Lupetta closer and then asked:

「Is that contraceptive effective?」 

「I heard… there are times when it doesn’t work…」

Well, that makes sense too. After ejaculating so much, it’s hard to believe that putting some of that pink gelatin could completely prevent pregnancy. She also didn’t want me to cum inside her, so perhaps it could only lower the chances of getting pregnant. There was always the chance of getting pregnant.

「Take your time to rest. I’ll contact you again soon.」

「Uh…」

「You’re reply?」

「… Yes, but…」

I quietly waited for her to continue. She probably didn’t think that I would let her off, so what did she want to say?

「If I come here everytime… the others might discover it…」

Facing down, Lupetta became silent. It seemed that she’d concealed the fact that she gave up her body to save Mergin from her party.

「The inn where your party is currently staying, where is it located?」

「We haven’t decided where to stay yet.」

Apparently, they were walking inside in high spirits after finally arriving at Nyuneri City. It was then that their party suddenly encountered me and were arrested. Their luck was rather bad. Since they were immediately arrested, they hadn’t been able to choose where to stay.

If that’s the case, then its more convenient.

「You guys have already been arrested once. Tell your party members to stay at different inns to prevent unnecessary misunderstanding. Then, you’ll be able to walk any time of the day without being found out by your party members.」

「Uh…」

  「Later, inform a person here about the inn where you’re going to stay. If I want to have sex with you, I’ll send a servant to contact you. I won’t tell you to come immediately. After my servant contacts you, arrange a time that’s convenient for you within the next few days.」  

It would actually depend on how I could escape from Fanny.

Lupetta nodded with a resigned look. She probably judged that she had no way out.

「One more thing. It would be better to move independently as much as possible within the city. I can’t guarantee that you guys will get released safely next time. It’s bad enough since you guys already have a record here, so make sure they wouldn’t be able to find any fault on your party.」 

Additionally, it would be easy to slip out every time I summon her if their party were to act separetely. 

I told Lupetta to make use of their arrest record to arrange an environment where she could easily slip out.  

「… Okay, I’ll do as you said… S-sir… please don’t tell this to anyone… 」

「Fine. This is just between you and me.」

「… Stop it…」

I kissed Lupetta, who had a bitter expression on her face, on the forehead before cutting out the faint illumination magic.

The room had become completely dark.

As I closed my eyes for a while, I could hear a lovely breathing next to me. Still, I never thought that contraceptives existed here. Suddenly, I remembered about the events in Nambonan. 

Anna probably used contraceptive secretly behind my back. I might be prejudiced, but she might have some knowledge on that matter since she was their bar’s idol. Even Lupetta knew about contraceptives, so there was no way Anna wouldn’t know about it.

Back when I stayed in Nambonan, I came inside Anna more than three times almost every day. I worked so hard in our lovemaking, so I felt slightly sad when I think that she’d been using contraceptive behind my back. I’d check on Anna’s actions after having sex with her the next time I go to Nambonan. If she used a contraceptive, then I would confiscate it. Then I’d let her experience real babymaking.

I wonder about Kohali. When I was about to cum inside her back then, she was unwilling and was telling me that she would get pregnant. Perhaps she also had some knowledge about contraceptives. After I had sex with Kohali, they immediately left as soon as I gave the gold, so I had no idea what happened to her after that. Perhaps her brother Rumon ran around the market to buy a contraceptive with the gold I gave them.

『Brother… I, I’ve been defiled…』

『… You’re clean… Put this in. It’s a medicine.』

『… I’m scared, brother. Please… put it inside.』

『I, I can’t. You should put it yourself.』

『… Brother…』

『Kohali… I understand, I’ll put inside for you.』

『Ahh, brother’s finger is entering inside me… nmm…』

… Now don’t give me that kind of development.

In Kohali’s case, it was scary since that development wasn’t impossible. When I go to Nambonan next time, I would properly confirm about it. And while at it, I would also warn that rascal Rumon.

「nm… mm…」

My thoughts were disrupted as Lupetta murmured in her sleep. Uh-oh, I was sleeping with a woman so it wasn’t good to think about other women. As the moonlight shined on her, I caressed Lupetta’s tired sleeping face.

「chu」

「nmm…」

When I kissed her on the cheek, she smiled.

「… I love you… Mergin…」

I wonder if she was having a good dream. Perhaps in her dream, she was being kissed by the man she liked. I’m sure she’d be surprised the next morning once she woke up from her blissful dream. I’m looking forward to her reaction at that time. 

While suppressing the urge to kiss Lupetta’s defenseless lips, I closed my eyes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 51: Preliminary Arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translator: Name correction from ‘Gandran’ to ‘Gandoran’.

I woke up the next morning and prepared my clothes for the day. Lupetta got out of the bed slightly later. When she looked around the room upon waking up, she almost burst in tears, so I brushed her gently to calm her down.

I ordered a servant to serve the breakfast here in the bedroom, since Lupetta wouldn’t be able to take a breakfast with me in the dining room. The dining room was considered a formal area, so some troublesome exchanges would be needed to let someone outside of the family sit. Table manners would be required, too. I couldn’t expect anything of that from Lupetta. However, there wouldn’t be a need to care about these troublesome things in my bedroom since it was considered a private area.

Incidentally, I had the servant also prepare clothes for Lupetta. Letting her have breakfast in a negligee would make me want to eat her instead. The clothes that were prepared for her was the same as the one she wore yesterday, but it had become beautiful with all the dirt washed off. A servant most likely stayed up all night to wash it.

After our breakfast was placed on the table, perhaps feeling hungry already, Lupetta began eating without delay.

「It’s very delicious.」

Lupetta said so delightfully. Just as I thought, Lupetta didn’t know table manners. Still, her way of eating wasn’t too messy.

「Is that so?」

I was thinking of telling her ‘make sure to eat a lot for the sake of the baby in your stomach’ as a joke, but I decided against it since the mood might turn gloomy.

「It’s my first time eating food this delicious.」

I considered telling her ‘It’s been nothing but first times for you since last night, hasn’t it?’ as a joke, but I decided not to since the mood might turn heavy.

「I see. Then eat as much as you want.」

「Un.」

Lupetta quietly moved her fork and spoon. She was eating so much that it made one wonder where in that small body of hers did all that food go. 

After Lupetta had emptied clean all the plates, she told me that she’d be returning to the army camp. Mergin would probably get released after the army’s morning assembly, so it was just right time for her to leave. I didn’t forget to remind her to contact once she’d decided where to stay.

「I understand… I’ll inform someone from this house.」

Lupetta shook her head in agreement. Her tone was serious, so I guess she would properly contact me.

「Lupetta.」

I extended my arms wide and stared at her.

「… Um?」

「I only want a hug. Come here.」

I pulled the troubled Lupetta by the hand and hugged her body closely. She stiffened slightly, but gradually relaxed as I continued hugging.

「I’ll contact you again soon, alright?」

「Uh… yes…」

Giving one last tight hug, I released her. As soon as she got released, Lupetta moved in front of the door like a cat running away.

「I’m leaving.」

「Alright.」

She nodded her head lightly and left the room. A servant was waiting outside the door, so she’ll probably be guided all the way outside.

Having the desire to drink an after meal tea, I rang the bell on the table.

Fanny was sulking when I returned to Nyuneri Castle after having breakfast. She declared her intention of staying at my residence next time, too. However, the only time I ever stayed at my residence was whenever I had a business involving my lower half. It would be rather problematic to bring Fanny there.

After putting her back in a good mood, I returned to my room and found Minith cleaning there. I had a feeling that this encounter was a scheme by someone, probably by Tesh or the head maid.

「Ahhh♡, young master… so much…」

「It’s not young master, right?」

「mm… Wilk-sama…」

And so, I poured the morning shot inside Minith’s precious place from behind her. Whether this was someone else’s scheme, plan, or whatever, nothing mattered anymore. I’d already turned into a monkey.

Minith looked exceptionally erotic. She stood with her legs wide opened and arms on the wall while semen dripped down from her secret garden, causing a stain on the carpet.

「nmmchu, chu… chu… love… you… chu♡…」

With only her neck turned to my direction, I pressed my lips against Minith’s lips. My desire to kiss had grown high since I wasn’t able to do so last night.

「Wilk-sama, I’m going to clean it.」

「I’m leaving it to you.」

Minith licked my rod that had become sticky from her love fluids and my semen. She ran her tongue with great care, taking into consideration that my rod was currently incredibly sensitive after just ejaculating.

「chu♡.」

Lastly, she planted a kiss on the tip before releasing it. Her cleanup didn’t last long, so I was unable to recover my hardness. Minith wiped it with a wet towel one more time and put my underwear back.

「Good girl, good girl.」

「nmmm～♡」

While Minith had her head lowered to the height of my waist, I caressed her head softly. She closed her eyes with an expression overflowing with joy.

Suddenly, I remembered that I had something to ask from Minith.

「Minith. When’s your next day off?」

「It’s tommorow.」

The servants working in Nyuneri Castle usually had a once a week day off. There was a rotation, so the day for the day off differed per servant.

「Tommorow, huh. I see.」

「Young master, is something the matter? Please don’t hesitate to speak about it.」 

Oh no, Minith’s switch had completely shifted to her work mode. It’s unfortunate, I still wanted to appreciate Minith in her lovey-dovey mode.

「Well, have you heard about how I sometimes walk around the castle town while concealing my identity?」

I would sometimes wander around the castle town in secret, exploring a look at places such as the market place while wearing commoner’s clothing and without any guards around. Even though I didn’t have guards nearby, ther would guards hiding behind the scenes to watch over attentively. They naturally wouldn’t let me walk alone. Also because there was a magic detecting formation in the city, it wasn’t difficult to defend against assassins.

A wide area detection magic would activate several times a day at fixed intervals in order to identify and suspicious magic users, but it would be in full operation to surveil the magic users in real time whenever I go down to the castle town. Perhaps the person in charge of the security viewed my incognito trip to the castle town as a very troublesome event.

「It’s my first time hearing about it. Is it different from the inspection tour to the Innovation Association?」

Whenever I went to the Innovation Association, I would be going out as a member of the House of Quordentz. Guards would stand by my side, so it couldn’t really be considered a secret trip. I explained the difference to Minith.

「It’s a covert inspection. I would go down to the castle town while wearing commoner’s clothing and without any guards.」 

「Is that so…?」

Minith looked like she found it hard to understand how the eldest son of Quordentz family would walk around without even a single guard. Her eyes popped out with astonishment.

Then, I decided to enter the main topic in question.

I felt my heart beating slightly faster.

「So, there’s this place that I want to visit together with you. That’s why I wanted to ask about your plans on your day off. Since your accompanying me, I’ll arrange it so that you’ll have two days off next week.」 

Unlike the usual trip down to the castle town where I would just walk aimlessly, I had a purpose in mind for the incognito trip this time. Though in some way, this was an invitation for a date. Well, Minith might view it as something like a business entertainment. I intended to count it as being on duty and prepare a compensatory day off next week for her.

Perhaps she realized that I was asking her out on a date, Minith looked around the room nervously with a red face. We’d just finished our intimate time, so there was no one else in the room except for the two of us.

 「Eh, ah, um… Just together… with young master…?」 

 「Right, it’s a date. But you probably have plans tommorow, so we can just go next week.」 

 「No! Please don’t worry about me. I don’t have any plans for tommorow. I feel very happy and honoured to be able to go around the castle town with young master.」

For some reason, Minith went down on her knees and placed her fingers on the floor. 

「Are you sure? I don’t want you to change your plans just for me… What did you plan to do for tommorow?」

 「Ehm, I was thinking of looking for a makeup set… That’s all. There wouldn’t be a problem to look for one next week.」

Apparently, she originally planned to go together with a close friend, but something came up with that friend, so she intended to go alone instead.

「I see. You’re fine tommorow then? I’ll contact you the meeting place and time.」

「Yes! I’ll be waiting!」

Minith stood up with a bright smile on her face. 

I felt glad upon seeing that she was so happy about it.

「Well then, I want Tesh to come inside the room to inform him about tommorow’s plan…」

Immediately understanding my intention, Minith quickly cleaned up the mess in the room after we had sex. Afterward, she left the room and brought Tesh back with her

「… And so, we’ll head to the castle town tommorow. Can I entrust you the arrangement of the guards and the security?」

「I understand.」

「Also, I’ve written a letter to Gandoran Group. I’ll entrust you to send it out.」

Gandoran Group was the slave trading company that sold Eve to me. While I was staying in my residence, I had decided on what to do about the matter concerning Eve’s mother, so I wrote the letter.

I would be going to Nambonan again soon. For that reason, I considered receving Eve’s mother in Nambonan City. I had no intention of letting Eve reunite with her mother, at least for now. In the one and a half month, Eve seemed to have understood her position a bit, but she was still unwilling to accept me. What I wanted to do was to raise her reliance towards me. If I were to let her meet with her mother now, there was no doubt that she’d choose to rely on her mother over me. I had already instructed the servants to treat her slightly better, so I hope she’d start depending on me soon.

Whether it was Nyuneri or Nambonan, there wasn’t much difference in distance from the city where Gandoran Group was based in, so there shouldn’t be a problem if I were to choose Nambonan.

「I have certainly received the letter.」

I sighed after handing over the letter to Tesh. 

With this, the number of my sexual partners in Nambonan would increase by another one. Perhaps I would be able to enjoy a threesome or foursome first before I could enjoy the mother and daughter pair.

Chapter 52: Castle Town Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translator: Correction, the name that Wilk used while in the castle town was ‘Will’. 



How could Nyuneri’s citizens tell me—the eldest son of the Marquis—apart from others? The answer was by appearance. The citizens would immediately recognize me if I were to wear a mantle with my family’s crest. There was no one in Nyuneri who didn’t know of Quordentz family’s crest.

Other than that, they might also recognize me if I were to don a dazzling armor, wear fine clothing, or bring guards along. Since our family’s photos weren’t put up for sale, only a few people really knew our faces. The citizens would, at most, know my age, height, as well as the color of my hair and eyes.

In short, the citizens would never think that I was the eldest son of the Marquis if I were to walk in a commoner’s clothes, put on a wig with a different color, and bring no guards along. 

「Young master, we’ll be guarding at the back. Please be careful.」 

「I’m counting on you.」

As soon as I passed through the wall separating the castle and the castle town, one of my guards whispered before disappearing in a blink of an eye. They would conceal themselves slightly far away and guard me.

I walked along the town street alone. The citizens didn’t recognize my identity and paid me no attention at all. I hadn’t felt so free in a long time.

The sound of the bell rang across the perfectly clear morning sky, notifying the current time. Clocks didn’t exist in this world, so the sense of time was quite fuzzy. Nyuneri City had a facility that observed the sun. When the sun reached a certain position in the sky, the bell would be sounded to inform the city of the time.

Since this world had no electric lights like in my previous one, and using light by activating magic wasn’t common, the citizens rarely worked till night. Instead, they would start very early in the morning. The sun was still low in the sky, but people were already walking along the main street.

There was a significant difference to this incognito trip compared to the last one. Since I had received permission from my father, there wouldn’t be any issue if I were to sleep with a citizen in the city. The mere thought of it made my eyes unintentionally glance at the women walking down the street. My eyes were wide opened to beauties around me. One of the objectives of this incognito trip was here.

Minith and I had decided to leave our houses as soon as the bell rang and then meet up in front of the statue in the central plaza. I left the castle slightly ahead since Minith’s house in the castle town was near the plaza.

「Well then.」

I stepped into the crowded plaza. When I lightly activated detection magic, there were commoner magic users walking around, but their number could be counted by one hand. Forget about killing me, they were far from enough to cause me any harm, so I just ignored them. 

There was a bronze statue at the heart of the plaza. The statue was easy to spot, causing it to become a meet up place among the citizens. Minith and I would also be meeting up here.

Did I arrive a bit early?, I thought. 

I observed the people in front of the statue. As expected, the front of the statue was crowded by people, including citizens, travelers, and adventurers. 

While I was observing the people, a girl who stood in front of the statue, wearing pretty clothes, approached me with inquiring eyes. Her chestnut colored hair, sitting above her shoulders, swayed gently. Her hair was let down, drawing a curve that outlined her face. It was a really beautiful hair.

「Um…」

The girl not only walked close, but she also spoke to me. Was I perhaps being picked up by a girl? She was the cutest among the women in front of the statue, so I felt slightly pleased. The men looked at me enviously. I had won it.

「Um, young master?」

When I looked closely at her face, the girl was actually Minith.

「Oh, Minith, so it was you. I wasn’t able to tell since you looked different from usual.」 

Her hair wasn’t in the usual bunned style. I guess there wasn’t a need to tie her hair in a bundle since she wasn’t on duty. With her hair down, the usual diligent impression that she gave off had disappeared. She instead exuded the vibes of a healthy town girl.

「Mm?」

Her hairstyle was kind of familiar. Where had I seen it before? As I thought a bit, I remembered a vague memory.

 「Speaking of which, I kind of remember that hairstyle from back then…」 

 「Yes, young master’s remembered it right. Back then, we were free to choose our hairstyle, so…」 

Without hiding her joy, Minith smiled. 

I felt jittery while brushing her hair, so I thought there was something about it, and it appeared that I was indeed right.

 「You’re no longer free to choose your own hairstyle now?」 

 「Yes. The head maid changed the rules back when the uniforms were introduced.」

The head maid, who loved being punctual, had apparently changed the rules back then when I decided to introduce the uniforms to the servants. Until then, they were allowed to do their hair any way they wanted as long as it wouldn’t hinder their work. However, a limitation had been placed due to the head maid’s view. According to the head maid, it wasn’t beautiful that their clothes were uniform, but their hairstyles differed. As a result, a rule had been established, that they could either shorten their hair or tie it up.

I remembered Minith’s current hairstyle. I thought it was kind of cute back then when I was going around surveying the servants about the uniforms. I see… I was unable to remember it back when I first had sex with her.

「How nostalgic. This hairstyle suits you and it’s cute.」 

I complimented her hairstyle without mentioning the fact that I had remembered about it just now.

「Thank you… I feel very happy.」

Minith placed her palm on her chest and breathed a great sigh of relief. Perhaps she was nervously waiting for me to notice her hair.

「By the way, Minith. Haven’t I told how you should refer to me today?」

 「Ah… yes. Um, would it really be fine?」 

Even though I was concealing my identity, people would eventually pick up on something if she were to keep calling me young master. Whenever I went down to the castle town, I always had a fake background prepared. Minith should’ve received a note containing my fake background yesterday from Tesh.

 「Please properly call me by that name. Otherwise, people might find out my identity.」

My background was that of a commoner, so my speech was also similar to the way they speak. There was no need to speak like boss like I always did, so it felt comfortable.

After taking a deep breath, as though switching gears, Minith spoke:

「Will.」

「Yeah, that’s good.」

「Will…」

Minith placed her fingers on her cheeks, blushing. Somehow, looking at her made me feel embarrassed too. If we continued flirting here in the middle of the plaza, a kick might come flying from the men’s side.

 「Minith, let’s walk around that area until we get used to it.」 

The place that I wanted to visit was, in a sense, enemy territory. Before rushing in, I wanted to shake off this awkward feeling first. When I reached my hand out, Minith looked at it with a troubled expression. 

「Mm? Do you prefer holding arms?」

Same as my previous world, when couples walked side-by-side, they’d either hold hands or the girl clings to the man’s arms. Which one does Minith prefer?, I wondered. I was fine either way, but considering our heights, I think it would be quite a pathetic sight if she were to cling to my arm.

 「No, ah… I don’t. I think, I like holding hands more.」 

As Minith spoke awkwardly, she grabbed my hand and even tightly interlocked fingers with mine. My hands were slightly hotter, so Minith’s cold fingertips felt pleasant.

While holding hands, we left the plaza and moved towards the back lane.

「Is the market already open?」

「Yes… yup. It’s already open.」

It seemed that Minith was struggling in adjusting her speech. The way she was having trouble speaking in a casual manner made her the exact opposite of Lupetta, which I found amusing.

I glanced at the surrounding and pulled Minith towards a shadow of a building.

「Umm…?」

 「Minith. Just be yourself and enjoy it.」 

I hugged her close and gave a light kiss. Minith leaned her body on me. If I were to engage in a deep kiss now, we’d probably be going head straight to the love hotel, so we only entwined tongues a bit. 

「nnmmchu♡… Will…」 

「Good girl.」

When I released Minith’s lips, she looked at me with desire in her eyes, but we couldn’t continue kissing here. There was still a place that I wanted to go and visit. It wasn’t like I wanted to get off yet.

「Minith, let’s go. Wasn’t there a place that you wanted to check out?」

「What about you? There’s no problem if go to mine later…」

「We can settle my business later. Let’s first get used to our relationship.」 

Pulling Minith’s hand, we returned to the back lane.

The marketplace was at the heart of the commercial district, and it required a bit of walk to go there from the plaza. Minith was surprisingly quick on her feet. I wanted to try being considerate, like men would do during dates, adjusting to the walking speed of their partner. Unfortunately, it seemed that there was no need to do it with Minith. Commoners typically walked fast, and I guess she was no exception.

「You wanted to look for a makeup set, didn’t you?」

「Yeah. Until now, I’ve been using the makeup set that has been handed to me by mom, so I want to buy a new one.」  

The marketplace was enveloped in a noisy and bustling atmosphere. It was filled with morning energy. People were laying out their carpets, setting up their tents, and doing business. It gave the image of a flea market. Whenever I took a stroll in the castle town, I always visited this Blue Sky Market. It never bored me since it always had interesting stuffs displayed.

「This way.」

Although the people looked as though they were just opening stores as they pleased, there was actually a rough standard operating procedure.

Minith pulled and led me to the area for women. There were many female customers around this part, so I’d never gone here until now since I was nervous to step in. But this time, I had a female companion, so I was able to confidently step inside the women’s area. I felt slightly troubled, thinking whether I should a present for Fanny. If I were to buy something she didn’t like, I felt like she’d sulk even more.

「Wow… It’s so pretty.」

Contrary to her usual demeanor, Minith raised a cheerful voice befitting her age. There was a wooden box that appeared to be a makeup set in front of her, and she was grabbing each tool with excitement. 

「Hmm, so this is a makeup.」

I’d never had a chance to step inside a young noblewoman’s dressing room, so it was my first time seeing these kinds of tools. Well, there was a chance that their makeup tools were different from the ones that commoners used, so it probably wouldn’t be of any help. I couldn’t give out any advice on which was good or bad. There were tools inside the wooden box, and I was totally clueless on how these tools were used.

「Mr. Boyfriend, it’s inappropriate to keep looking when a woman’s buying her beauty products.」 

The woman tending the store reprimanded me. Certainly, I felt like it was slightly insensitive to keep staring at a woman’s beauty products. Wondering if I made a mistake, I glanced at Minith’s reaction.

「Boyfriend… boyfriend… ufu…♡」

For some reason, she looked really happy. There was a difference in our age and height, but it was good that people were properly seeing us as a couple.

 「How about buying an ornament or something? There are good ones over there. Go and have a look at them.」 

「Come come! Take a look here!」

I was immediately led to a woman who was opening a store next door. It seemed that this store sold accessories. Minith went along with my request, so I should at least give her a gift.

 「Your girlfriend is a beauty, so I think the accessories around here will suit her. It will definitely look good on her! She’ll be happy… and perhaps she might even listen to your naughty request.」 

The woman spoke the last words while showing a gesture of lowering her voice. She was still young, and yet her behavior was like a middle aged woman.

「What’s this one made of?」

 「Mm? Ah, that’s a comb made of tortoiseshell. It’s from the tortoise that comes out of fields, the one with a green shell.」 

The comb’s material was similar to a tortoise’s shell, so I had my doubts about it, but it looked like tortoiseshell was indeed the raw material.

「Do tortoise come out of fields?」

 「You… are you a young master of a rich family? Tortoises that feed on leaves and roots come out in great number during the beginning of spring. They are about this size. Their meat isn’t very delicious, but their shell has many uses.」

When the woman mentioned the size, she formed a circle the size of an ordinary automobile’s tire with her hands. The tortoise was quite large. 

I remembered that tortoiseshells were usually obtained from sea turtles. I never thought  they could get one in the land, what a mysterious creature. There were animals on earth that existed in this world, and there were also mysterious creatures that I’d never seen before. That tortoise must be from the latter group.

「Did you like it? Processed tortoiseshells are beautiful, after all. If your going to gift your girlfriend, then choose a good one, like this one here.」

Perhaps because I casually picked a comb, she lined up combs with different colors of tortoiseshell. There was blue, yellow, green, red, purple, white, brown, and black. The scene before my eyes had turned colorful.

「These colors…」

「They are all from different tortoises. The cheapest is the green one, and the most expensive ones are the red and blue.」

Oh my turtle, there were so many of them. Perhaps the world was actually flat, and it was being supported on the back of a gigantic turtle.

「The red and blue lived up to its price, they are beautiful.」

Although the red and blue were expensive, that was only from the perspective of a commoner. I could easily buy a box of them. When I held the red comb towards the sun which had already risen slightly higher, the half-transparent comb caused a red light to shine on the ground.

「Do have anything other than combs?」

「Anything… That’s too vague. Can’t you narrow it down a bit? For example, hair ornament, earring, necklace, or a ring.」

Since I would give her a present, I’d like her to use it every day. I thought about an accessory that she could use even when working as a maid. I tried remembering the appearance of the maids in the castle, but I’d never seen anyone wearing accessories like earrings or a necklace. This must be due to the head maid’s actions behind the scenes.

However, I realized that there was one accessory.

「Do you have something to tie up the hair?」

The rule established by the head maid had caused  a lot of maids to tie up their hair in a bundle with ribbons or strings, among others. They were free to choose, to some extent, which hair fastener to use. Minith used a plain fastener that looked similar to a barrette to tie up her hair. 

 「Oh yes. If your looking for a hair tie, then we have quite a lot of them.」 

The woman displayed different kinds of hair tie. There must be a demand for them since there were lots of long-haired women.

「This one.」

 「That one? What was that again… Errr, that’s a flower with a nice smell. Tortoiseshell was used to make that accessory. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?」 

I took a barrette the shape of a red flower. The petals appeared to be made of processed tortoiseshell, it was sparkling beautifully. Its size wasn’t too large, so I think the head maid wouldn’t confiscate it.

「I’ll buy this one.」

「Okay, thank you～.」

I handed a silver coin, which had been prepared for today, and received the barrette. When I glanced at Minith, she was looking at the makeup sets slightly far away from me. I’d decided to give it to her later.

After Minith looked at the accessories for a while, she moved towards me. It seemed that she didn’t buy anything since she had nothing in her hands.

「Wait, you didn’t buy anything?」

「… I didn’t. They said that a peddler will be coming from another place soon and there will be better products for sale. I’ve decided to wait until then.」

「I see.」

I guess buying cosmetic products wasn’t something to be rushed. Minith looked satisfied after looking at the goods displayed. I pointed my finger outside.

「Is there anything else you’d like to see?」

「Well, I’d like to look for cloths…」

Commoners normally wouldn’t buy finished clothes. Assuming they buy one, they’d buy a second-hand. Most of the time, they would buy materials to make new clothes or fix their old clothes.

I wanted to visit a clothing store with a girl and enjoy the situation where the girl would ask me ‘Does it look good on me? Which one is better?”, and then I’d start getting annoyed since she couldn’t decide on what to pick.

「Then let’s go and look for cloths.」

I pulled Minith by the hand and walked. 

The sun had reached high in the sky, and after taking lunch at a food stall in the central plaza, the sound of the bell reverberated.

It was already afternoon.

「Will, what are we going to do after this? 」

「Hmm, let me see…」

Minith seemed to have become accustomed to behaving as lovers, and the awkwardness had mostly disappeared.

「Let’s go.」

I’d decided to proceed to this trip’s place of destination. We left the central plaza and entered the area opposite of the commercial district. There were many old buildings around this part, and the atmosphere was calm.

「It’s just around the corner after turning right.」

Led by Minith, I walked while breathing the slightly musty air. The alley’s old cracked stone paving gave an excellent ambiance. From the perspective of a former Japanese person, even the other districts were a sight to behold on their own, but this district felt like you’re walking inside an enormous world heritage.

「Wow… So this is the place?」  

「Yup. I also felt it when I visited here the last time, but the building is really impressive.」 

After passing the slightly dark alley, a large church came into sight. The stone walls were light orange and the roof bronze. A tremendous amount of funds must’ve been invested in the construction of the building. Its past glory was visible to see.

There were fine and delicate arts on the walls, but the long passage of time had caused many areas to blacken and begin to collapse. That building was a religious establishment under the management of Xessian Synod. It was the Church of Xess.

Chapter 53: The Church of Xess
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translator: I’d like to correct mistake last chap. Minith referred to our MC as ‘Will’ and not his real name ‘Wilk’. 



Xessian Synod. 

The subsidiary body that supported this organization was known as the Church of Xess. The origin of this organization which emerged from Xessianism was said to have existed more than one thousand years ago. They were once the most influential organization in the Elluo Continent, and as the ones who governed faith, they controlled countries from behind the scenes. The aphorism on earth that ‘nothing is absolute’ seemed to apply in this world too, and the Synod was not an exception to it. The organization decayed thoroughly over many years and eventually collapsed.

Around two hundred years ago, the organization’s power fell to the ground after going through an eighty-year-long religious war, which was followed by the dark ages, and finally, the period of the nobles’ rise to prominence.

The Dark Ages.

The Levios family, a prominent noble in the eastern part of the continent, gathered the nobles in the surrounding area and opposed the Synod. Their slogan at that time was “Destroy the church, kill the priests, correct the believers.” That was like the commission issued by the nobles to destroy the Synod.

Over the decades, the alliance’s size grew larger and larger. Afterward, the alliance leader—the Levios family—represented the nobles and declared the establishment of a state. That event eighty years before the present time had marked the birth of the Levios Kingdom.

On the west side of the continent, the third son of a puny noble rose up and took action. He united the people by opposing the Synod using a different style and later established the Jinkaen Empire.

The present Elluo Continent had three major powers: Levios Kingdom, Jinkaen Empire, and Mamshred Federation. Two of the three were similar in that both opposed the Synod.

In future textbooks, Levios Kingdom would probably end up being written as the beginning of the separation of church and state.

I looked up at the church before my eyes and sighed.

「It’s run-down.」

I’d heard that the Church of Xess in Nyuneri City was built slightly before the religious war, which later became known as the Navenpos’ High Priesthood Disturbance, two hundred years ago. Considering the timeline, it would be more than two hundred years since this church had been built. 

Also due to historical circumstances, there were no old churches in the Levios Kingdom. They were destroyed upon sight. In that regard, Quordentz’s territory was quite special. Nobles from other territories apparently found it surprising that churches here had remained standing to this day.

Before we entered the church, I activated detection magic and counted the magic users just in case. When I scanned around the area, there was a single response from an establishment next to the church. As for my guards who were hiding nearby, I just ignored them.

「That over there is a convent.」

While I was looking at that establishment, Minith explained it for me. The size of that magic user’s magic power didn’t seem to be much, so there probably wouldn’t be any problem.

「Will, what’s the matter? Don’t you want to come inside?」

「My bad, I was just thinking a bit. Let’s go inside.」

I grabbed Minith’s hand and passed through the widely left opened entrance of the church. This church always had its doors opened so that it’s easy for first-time visitors to enter. I had never entered inside the church until now since I was scared of entering alone because I felt like I’d get brainwashed.

According to Minith, there was apparently a priest here who was excellent at speaking. I was hoping to hear some interesting episode or behind-the-scenes stories of the Synod. 

「Hello.」

Passing through the entrance, an elderly woman standing nearby greeted us. She seemed to have discerned that we were newcomers, and she asked why we came here in a nice tone.

「My friend took me here few days ago.」

The elderly woman made an expression of understanding when Minith mentioned the name of her friend. It seemed that her friend was a devout believer. 

「The great spirit of the sun, Whatenthsāma, anwered my prayers. I came here to offer my gratitude.」

Her response was clear and concise.

「Oh my, that’s wonderful. Please wear a habit and proceed inside.」[1]

The elderly woman gave a sincere smile and beckoned us to proceed first. I was curious about her clothes. Perhaps she was a nun in the convent.

Churches under the Synod had a distinctive attire for its members, including the priests and the believers. Female members wore a completely black dress with wide sleeves along with a black veil. Male members dressed the same as the female members, but a shorter veil. It was possible to find yourself in a despairing situation where you’d feel aroused seeing someone’s back figure, and then you’d realize that it was actually a man. What a dangerous thing.

「Do we change here?」 

「Yup.」

There were religious habits provided for the guests, and they were separated based on their approximate size. Taking one that seemed to match my size, I hid in a nearby dressing partition and changed clothes. I stored my clothes inside a basket. My clothes weren’t worth much, so I didn’t care even if they were stolen.

The habit was slightly large, but since it was only borrowed, I could only put up with it. Lastly, I placed the black veil on my head and properly put away my hair. Just as I thought, this clothing really looked like a nun’s clothing, so I felt like I was cross-dressing.

「It looks good on you, Will.」

「It looks good on you, too… Yup, cute.」

In Minith’s case, the size was slightly small, so her curves were on display. Since her hair was also covered by veil, only her face was visible. Without the hair added in, a beautiful person would still be beautiful, while an ugly person would stand out all the more. Minith was beautiful, so I felt lucky.

I sensed that the other people were occationally looking in our direction. My gaze also unintentionally went to Minith’s curvy ass.

Minith and I were beside one another as we went inside the church. We moved straight forward through the corridor which had a number of rooms without doors. Apparently, the altar area was located ahead. 

Sculptures of different spirits were displayed in the corridor, and paintings that depicted nature’s magnificence was hanged on the wall. Even though I wanted to stop and observe them, I still continued moving.

「I see that it’s been properly maintained.」

The cleaning appeared to be thorough, and the corridor gave an impression of being clean without a speck of dust. When I looked at the laid out carpet, it was slightly old but well maintained. Its original material seemed to be high-quality. 

The church gave an impression of experiencing honest poverty rather than simply poverty despite the fact that Holy Navenphos, the Synod’s main headquarters, was in trouble due to economic collapse.

We proceeded through the corridor and entered the altar area. There was an altar for prayers at the very back, and it looked like the stage of a grade school’s gymnasium. Candles and artwork objects were placed there.

The Synod’s followers, also called Xessians, were required to worship once a day. They weren’t required to come to church to pray, but it was apparently easier to pray when there’s an object of worship rather praying while facing empty space, so that was why they gathered at the church.

Perhaps it was the time to offer prayers, there were many devotees waiting for their turn in front of the altar. I wasn’t a believer, so there was no need to offer a prayer. I only came here to observe. Besides, even though I’d read about their doctrines and holy scripture, I didn’t know their prayer etiquette.

「Hey, can I offer my prayers?」

「Mm?」

「My wish has been granted, so I think I should express my gratitude.」

Minith had prayed for my safety in my first campaign, so she apparently thought of expressing her thanks here in the church. She prayed towards the sun the other day, but she apparently wanted to pray here in the church just to be sure.

I momentarily considered lining up with her, but I saw that the devotees were silent as the dead while they waited for their turn. It would be impossible for me to join in that kind of atmosphere.

「Sure, go ahead… I’ll go and explore the corridor and other rooms.」

After sending Minith in the waiting line in front of the altar, I’d decided to wander inside the church. I felt nervous before entering a room, but it was all good once I entered inside. After going inside a room facing the corridor, I looked around at the sculptures and paintings that were different from the ones displayed in the corridor.

「Oh?」

When I entered the next room, someone at the corner caught my attention. I didn’t know whether the person was a man or a woman since I could only see the person’s back figure. However, that person’s religious habit didn’t seem to match the person’s size. A devout believer definitely would wear a habit that matched their size. I had a feeling that this person was like me, a first-time visitor. I felt a slight sense of fellow feeling, so I took a slightly long detour and moved in front of that person.

「Sir…?」

「Lupetta?」

Both our hairs were concealed by the veil, so the only way to identity the other person was through their face. However, there was no way I’d mistake Lupetta’s beautiful looks and her silver colored eyes. I never imagined running into her in this kind of place.

「You’re a Xessian?」

「I’m not. Sir is a follower despite being in the army? Is that okay?」

「It’s not okay, and I’m not. I’m only here to observe. Are you also here to observe?」

「… Not really.」

Before I could ask what in the world did she come here for, Minith entered inside the room. She seemed to have been searching for me here and there, and she was short of breath.

「Will, sorry for making you wait.」

「It’s alright.」

Upon slowly entering the room, Minith looked at us alternately. Then, her gaze shifted and remained on me. Her eyes weren’t the eyes of a lover blaming her man for talking with another woman, but the eyes of a maid inquiring whether to step back.

While I was thinking on what to say, Lupetta’s small lips moved first.

「Since Mergin’s here, I’ll be going… taking my leave now.」

With Minth inside the room, Lupetta probably thought of changing her tone to a polite one since we were no longer alone.

Without waiting for my reply, Lupetta left the room in a hurry. Outside the room, there was a tall man and two women wearing a religious habit. Assuming the man was Mergin, then one of the two women might be ‘that woman’ who caused Lupetta’s stress. Assuming that my guess was right, then there might be something wrong in the heads of these adventurers, for the three of them to walk together so early after being released not too long ago.

Between the two women, the one in front, the woman who was suspected to be ‘that woman’, had her hair out in the open without covering it by veil. She made the right choice since her looks were average.

She had quite a nice body, but I didn’t feel anything at all since she wasn’t a beauty. Even with her hair out in the open, I felt like I wouldn’t be able to sleep with her unless I restrained myself from sex for two days. 

Which reminded me, there should’ve been only one magic user in the area. When I activated detection magic here to test it, no response came back from Mergin, Lupetta, and the woman in front. Perhaps their magic seals hadn’t been released yet.

「Ah, Will. That woman over there is the priest who talked to me the other day.」 

「Which one?」

「The one with her hair covered.」

Indeed, since the woman at the back had her hair covered by veil, it was correct to describe her as ‘the one with her hair covered.’ However, that wasn’t the most appropriate way to describe her. If it was me, I’d describe her as ‘the one with enormous breasts.’

There was a response from her when I activated a detection magic, and it was the same one that I sensed from the convent before I entered the church. She was a nun with magic power, so perhaps she also served as a priest.

The size of the busty woman’s religious habit was probably the right one for her, but it was protruding due to her breasts, concealing her body lines. She probably had a slender figure based on her looks, but she appeared plump.

「Are you perhaps here to observe?」

The busty woman approached us. There was no telling the color of her hair since it was completely hidden by the veil, but her eyes were golden. I’d always been poor at guessing a woman’s age, but she was probably around Minith’s age if not slightly younger. She was a gentle beauty with a calm and kind looks.

Minith and I responded ‘yes’ to her question. Then, Minith told her that their conversation last time was interesting and implicitly indicated that this was her second time visiting.

「I feel very happy that there’s a person who wants to learn the teachings of the spirits.」

She gave a gentle smile. It was a smile that was brimming with kindness, and it made my heart warm. I’d decided to add this busty woman in the target list in my head.

「If you could wait for a moment, I’d be able to tell you stories again. What do you think? 」

From her perspective, she’d be more than willing to talk if it meant more followers. Minith and I nodded and waited for the busty woman’s storytelling.

When we left the church, it had already gotten quite dark outside.

The busty woman might be experienced in telling stories since she was good at speaking. The content was mainly about the stories of the spirits, but she also let us hears stories that were only handed down to the Synod, and they were very interesting. The busty woman put more effort into telling stories when she saw me enthusiastically taking notes on a wooden board. Her stories were worthwhile, so much that I considered giving a reward even if the other party belonged to the Synod.

「It’s already dark.」

「Oh, you’re right.」

Church facilities were lined up in a narrow area around this part. Moreover, there were also many churches other than the Church of Xess, so many areas were shadowed by these establishments. The sun hadn’t completely disappeared yet, but the area had a gloomy impression when compared to the main street.

The crimson evening sky and the deep black shadow casted by the establishments made a peculiar contrast, and it made me feel anxious.

「Will.」

Minith grabbed my hand.

「I’ll never forget this day…」

Minith smiled as the evening sky shined on the tears in her eyes.

I grabbed back Minith’s hand and gently embraced her. Although it wasn’t proper to flirt in front of a church, it couldn’t be helped since I really wanted to hold her. 

I see, so this was the mentality of those guys who flirted in public.

「I had fun today. I’m glad that I invited you, Minith.」

I pulled Minith inside the shadow of a building. The silence inside seemed as though it stopped even sound itself, and the sound of our kiss resounded especially loud.

「I also had fun.」

Minith gave a slightly shy smile.

Well, the fun was just about to begin.

Chapter 54: Eating the Madly in Love Maid (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Where was the main event of the date? It was… on top of the bed.

Pulling Minith by the hand, I embraced her closer.

「Will…?」

Some time ago, I asked a soldier from the Quordentz Army and heard that the love hotels in the castle town couldn’t be considered clean. I didn’t want to have sex in a room that contained fleas. Perhaps there were high-class hotels in the castle town. Unfortunately, I hadn’t yet conducted an inquiry on the matter. Naturally, it would be pathetic to ask that question to Minith, and it was doubtful whether she knew the location of the love hotels. So, I chose my house. There was some distance to my house, but it was still within walking distance. This morning, I had instructed Tesh to prepare the bath and bed.

Pausing for a moment, I turned a serious look at Minith.

「After this… are you okay?」

Being a quick-witted person, Minith immediately caught on what I wanted to say, and she responded with an attractive look.

「I’m okay… I also want to stay with you for a little longer…」

Her voice was irresistible, so much that I would’ve undressed her on the spot if there weren’t people in the alley.

My residence had three baths: men’s bath, women’s bath, and an open air bath. There were many considering that this was my deceased uncle’s love nest.     

As I walked through the hallway towards my room after leaving the men’s bath, there was a small silhouette walking from the opposite direction.

「Ah…! M-master, welcome back.」

The identity of the silhouette with a forced smile on her face was Eve. She was probably done with her work at the Innovation Association and was on her way to her room. Looking at her bowing her head and trembling as she waited for me to leave, I thought of a great idea. 

Without finding any faults on her, I continued walking through the hallway. Then, I gave an instruction to the servant who was standing by in front of my bedroom’s door.

I entered my bedroom and lay on the bed. Minith had entered the bath and was in the middle of polishing her womanhood, so I had nothing to do at the moment. I fanned myself with my hand to cool my flushed face due to the hot bath.  The season was becoming more and more like fall, and it felt really hot after just leaving out of the bath.

「Tell the shadow to bring a bucket of water in my room. Afterward, step back.」

「I understand.」

I ordered the servant inside my room and prepared myself for the fun that was about to begin. After I checked the barrette that I bought at the blue sky market, I decided to kill time by reading the wooden board, which contained the notes of the talk with the busty woman.

The moment I sat on the bed after checking the bucket, someone knocked on the door. This manner of knocking was the one used by the servants. I’d already told the servant to step back afterward, so I wonder who and for what purpose did this servant come here.

「Who is it? Enter.」

「Excuse me.」

The door opened, and standing there was Minith. She was a maid, so I supposed it was no wonder that she knocked the way servants did. My words were a bit cold when I granted permission to enter, and it seemed to have caused her to be a little nervous.

「I’ve been waiting for you. Come closer.」

「Yes.」

I moved to the bed and sat down. Since I deactivated the illumination magic, only the dim glow of the candle lighted the room. Minith neared slowly, one step at a time. Maids serving at the castle normally didn’t come to my residence, so it was her first time to step foot in my bedroom.

「I’m very sorry for making you wait, young master.」

Minith, standing in front of me, bent her waist and apologized. For some reason, her  behavior had returned to her usual professional behavior.

「Our date isn’t over yet, so why are you being so formal?」

「No, um, there were many people wearing a servant’s uniform, so I unconsciously… and, Tesh-sama also came…」

When we entered my residence a while ago, Tesh was waiting at the rear entrance, and we were led by him. It was interesting to watch Minith panic at that time. Tesh was a superior, a boss to her. I guessed it was like when a female employee who was about to enter a love hotel with the company president gets caught by the department head.

「Hmm. I see. You don’t need to force yourself to change the way you behave. Minith, you can call me any way you want when we are on the bed. I’d be happy if you speak to me in a more intimate manner, but it’s still best to speak in the way you feel most comfortable.」

「Thank you very much for your consideration.」

I patted the bed and guided her to sit next to me.

「Yes… okay. I’ll sit down then.」

「That’s my girl.」

I stroked Minith’s head and praised her for changing to a less formal behavior. Minith had probably been taking care of her hair every day. Brushing her hair, it smoothly passed through between my fingers. I really enjoyed feeling smooth hairs.

「By the way, I have something for you. I bought it today at the market.」

I passed the barrette at the corner of the bed into Minith’s hand.

「Wow… what a beautiful tortoise shell craft…」

She moved her hand towards the candlelight while holding the barrette, causing the ornament made of red tortoiseshell to glow vividly.

「This is… a maloashina flower, right? I love it…」

Minith’s eyes brimmed with tears as she looked at me. They reflected the candle, glowing as though lit up by the candle flame. She lovingly touched the flower-shaped barrette with her fingers.

「I didn’t know the name, but I thought that flower suits you the best.」

It seemed that I got it right. The instant I saw this ornament at the market, I thought it was similar to the pleasant smelling flower that Minith often arranged in a vase. This flower was also present in my room during my first time with Minith. Since I was going to give her a present, I wanted to choose something that was connected to both of us.

「Uhhh……」

Minith’s shoulders shook as round tears flowed down her cheeks. She seemed to have been overcome by emotions, facing down while holding the barrette in front of her chest.

「I’m glad that you liked it.」

「Uuhhh… Will…」

I embraced Minith and waited until she stopped crying. A short while after, her body stopped shaking, and she stared at me and closed her eyes.

「nnmh… chu… mmhhchu… chu♡ …nmmhaa… chu♡ haa… mmhchu♡　chu♡　nmmhhchu♡」

The instant our lips met, Minith sucked my lips hard. I felt myself getting more and more aroused along with her rough breathing. I moved my hand to the back of her head and met her tongue inside my mouth.

「Young mas—Will, Will… I love… you…」

「I love you too…」

As I felt intoxicated by the taste of love from her tongue, I let out a voice to respond to her feelings. In response, she gave a passionate and deep kiss. Minith sealed my mouth just as I was about to continue my words, and it almost knocked me over.

I pulled my tongue back and stopped the kiss for a moment.

「nnm… mmhー?」

Her eyes looked beautiful as they revealed her desire to kiss a second time. I couldn’t resist it and surrendered immediately.

「mnchuu♡… haa haa… chu♡ nmmfaa♡ chu♡ chu…」

As the passionate kissing continued, I softly placed my hand on the shoulder string of the babydoll dress that Minith was wearing. I still had no idea of the person behind preparing this dress, but that person once again performed an excellent job. The deep orange colored cloth and the design that slightly emphasized the chest looked very good on Minith. The bright color suited her cheerfulness today.

「chu♡」

Perhaps noticing that I was trying to undress her, Minith decreased the intensity of her kiss. And precisely at that moment, I separated slightly from her and took off the ribbon on her chest. The chest area of her dress parted, and her breasts spilled out.

「No~」

Her lovely meat buns which befitted her age—neither small nor big—shook. While Minith covered her face with both hands from embarrassment, I untied the knot of her string panty.

「Kyaaa!」

Hugging Minith’s completely naked figure from behind, I threw her string panty down the bed. The dancing candle flame illuminated her most private area.

「Will, you pervert… Don’t…」

I could tell that Minith was doing her best to close her legs. While putting strength in my arm to prevent her legs from closing, I checked her pubic hair. It looked slightly more maintained than the last time we had sex.

「Ah…no♡! Please don’t look…」

Perhaps embarrassed because I was staring at her down there, she let out a sweet voice. I gently brushed her pubic hair. It was chestnut-colored, same as her hair.

Incidentally, there was custom around this area for married or engaged women to shave their pubic hair. Apparently, they would shave their pubic hair and promise to only show their flower to the man in their life.

「You have hair down there.」

I truly intended to impregnate Minith, and I had never considered handing her over to another man. Despite receiving the love of a powerful person, she showed no signs of growing impudent, and I was honestly happy that she truly loved me. That was why I wanted to shave her pubic hair; I wanted to make her aware of my existence in a visible form. Once she got pregnant of my child, I planned to officially receive her as my mistress.

「If I told you to shave, would you hate it?」

While stuck close to my chest, Minith’s back greatly shook. In some sense, this was like a proposal. When I placed my hand on her chest, I felt her soft breasts and even the intense beating of her heart.

Men would tell their partner, “shave your pussy for me.” Alright, they wouldn’t really put it in such a direct way, but this proposal was apparently quite popular among the commoners. I heard that there was even a person responsible for handing over a razor during the proposal. 

「I wouldn’t! I’m happy to do it! Young mas—Will, It’s like a dream to shave it for you… Aaahh♡…」

After I softly embraced Minith as she immersed in great joy, I picked up the razor on top of a table. Then, I placed the bucket of water on top of the round tea table in front of Minith and handed over the razor to her.

「Let me see you shave.」

I observed from behind her with my chin on her shoulder.

「Y-yes…！」

Blushing up to her ears, Minith scooped water from the bucket and scattered it between her legs. Upon seeing that incredibly sensual sight, my lower half reached the critical point.

「I’m going to start shaving it, okay?」

「Alright, show it to me.」

The sound of hair being sliced rang as the razor gently brushed her skin. Minith’s sparse pubic hair continued falling, and as her pubic hair decreased, her white skin gradually became visible. Perhaps her skin got cut since there was no shaving foam, tiny round blood occasionally surfaced from her skin.

「Ah…!」

I activated recovery magic on her damaged skin and healed it. I wouldn’t hesitate to use my magic power for the sake of smooth and beautiful pussy. 

「I don’t deserve such consideration… young master…」

Normally, it would be impossible to have a noble directly cast magic on a commoner. Her hand halted, and it seemed that my action had moved her to the point of shaking.

「I did it specially for you. It’s our secret, alright?」

「Y-yes.」

Minith
bent her head backward and rubbed it on my chest. This hard feeling felt very
pleasant.

「Look, your hand has stopped moving. Aren’t you going to shave your hair for me?」

As I stroked her head, I reminded Minith to continue shaving her pubic hair. It didn’t take long before her flower became smooth and clean.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 55: Eating the Madly in Love Maid (Part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minith moved the bucket containing her pubic hair and the razorblade on the tea table. At the corner of the bed, I was brushing off the balls of hair that were scattered around with my hand. 

Minith’s figure as she embarrassingly performed her task while covering her crotch with a hand was a very stimulating sight.

「I’m done.」

「Oh, then come over here.」

I laid her down next to me on the bed.

「Minith, I’ve very happy.」

I held her shoulders and softly kissed her over and over again while lying on the bed. Minith revealed great joy on her blushed face, and she allowed me to do as I pleased.

「I’ll have a look at the place that you kept only for me.」

「Y-yes…」

As Minith remained lying on the bed, I raised my body up. Then, I grabbed her legs and gently spread them open.

「I  can see everything clearly. It’s really beautiful.」

「Aaah… T-this is so embarrassing… Aaaaahh…」

I observed her shaved and totally exposed vagina. With her pubic hair gone, each part of her vagina had become visible. Using my fingers, I rubbed the small pink folds of her flower. Her entrance opened and closed, as though eager to take it inside. It looked as though it was screaming to put it inside.

Her vagina glistened with fluids, and it was so soaking wet that it was difficult to tell if it was the leftover water at the time she shaved, or if she was simply just aroused from being observed by me.

「There’s no need to be embarrassed about it. I’m actually very happy that your allowing only me to see this place.」

I observed her tiny hole, which opened and closed like the mouth of a goldfish. Just looking at her privates made me want to go inside and enjoy the pleasant feeling. However, it was still too early for that. 

I stuck out my tongue and pressed it against her enlarged clit.

「Hyaaa?! 」

I ran my tongue all over her treasured place, soaking it with saliva. Her female scent tickled my nose, and the salty taste stimulated my tongue. 

「Young Master! That, that place! Ahhhmm♡」

Without responding to her, I continued teasing her with my tongue, causing wet noises to resound within the room. This place had been prepared specially for me, so I had to make sure to leave my marking. With two objectives in mind, I spread my saliva on her pussy. 

「Nooo! Young Master, that place, aah! Aaah! Mmmh! This is embarrassing! So embarrassing! Aahh, please don’t lick me there! It’s dirty! 」

This situation—getting her pussy licked by her master—seemed to have aroused Minith. Her cries were surprisingly loud while leaking slippery fluids nonstop. Until now, I had never tried eating her pussy, but this sure was amazing. 

While playing with her vagina with my fingers, I whispered near her ear. 

「Getting licked by your master made you this wet, what a dirty maid.」

「Aaaahhh! Please don’t say it! Mmmh, that’s because, because, mmmhh♡! 」

「I won’t stop. Didn’t you shave it for me? I have to taste it more.」

As I enjoyed her arousing moans, I once again slipped between her legs and began working my tongue. I stimulated her pink pearl, peeling and returning its skin with my tongue, and then pressing against it. 

After a short while, perhaps the pleasure had overwhelmed her embarrassment, her voice gradually lowered down.

「Aah… Nmh… Young Master… Aah… This is embarrassing… Aaah♡」

Her whole body seemed to be feeling it, and I couldn’t tell where her weak spot was located. I was really happy that she was letting out pleasant cries, but I couldn’t identity the location of her sensitive spot. 

Relying on her flooding love fluids, I continued running my tongue on her.

「Ah, aaaah, nooo♡, aahh, fu… Ah, fuu, Aah, aahh♡」

Minith’s speech gradually became incoherent, and her breathing rough. Her two peaks stood out, moving up and down as she breathed. I’d judged that she was ready to take me in, or to be exact, she was all ready. Her vagina had loosened up by a lot.

「Aaah, hurry… Young Master, Young Master… 」

From the looks of it, we’d both reached our limit. 

I raised my head from her legs and moved my face close to hers. 

「Minith, I’m putting it in.」

「Please… Young Master… I can’t endure it, any longer… Kiss… Kiss me…」

While we kissed, I arranged my body’s position. Considering that Minith was lying down facing upward on the bed, there could only be one sex position. 

「Ah… Let’s do it while kissing… I want to see… Young Master’s face…♡」

Our thoughts were the same. Since both of us wanted to do it in a missionary position, then we’d go with that position. Responding to her with a kiss on the forehead, I spread her legs open. Then, I positioned my rock hard dick to her entrance, which opened and closed.

「I’m going in.」

「Come in♡.」

When I lowered my waist and pushed my dick inside her hole, her vagina tightly grasped me inside, as though it had been longing for it. I was getting sucked inside and could only go deeper and deeper. Her incredibly warm wall felt excellent, making me want to remain connected with her.

「Aaaah~… ♡ Aah… Mmmh… Mmhh～♡」

Listening to her satisfied moans, I pushed my dick inside to the root. After confirming that I’d entered her whole, I sought Minith’s lips.

「chu♡ nmmfaa… chuuu♡ haa, haaah…… nmchuu♡ haa…… chu♡」

「Haa, haa. Minith, I love you.」

「chu… I love you very much, Young Master… Love you… Mmhchu… ♡」

I continued delving into her deepest area. Each time I pulled and thrust my waist, seductive cries resounded within the room, tickling the desire within me. 

「Ah! Ahh! Ahhh! Ah♡ Young Master! I love you! Ahhm♡」

「Minith, Minith, Minith」

The arousal made me shout out her name and move my hips without thinking of anything else. My brain couldn’t work properly, probably due to lack of oxygen or perhaps overwhelmed by the pleasure. Even so, I wanted to hear her cries, so I didn’t stop moving my waist. However, my limit drew near.

「Ah, Minith, I’m about to cum!」

My solid rod increased in hardness by another level. I could tell that I’d entered the final preparation to ejaculate. Minith entwined her legs around my ass, an action she did to receive my semen deep inside her.

「Young Master! Please give me lots! I’ll accept your everything…♡ Please give me a baby♡! 」

Her legs around my ass tightened, and she pulled my waist closer. As though responding to her desire to accept my everything, I sensed that all my stored semen rushed up like an erupting volcano.

「Minith! I’ll let out everything! Take it all! Get pregnant!」

「Yes! Young Master.」

Thick semen rushed out, spreading inside her most treasured place. My dick was soaked by the semen inside her, and that slippery and warm feeling led me to cum even more.

I want to completely make her mine, such desire made my arms move on their own, and when I noticed it, I was already hugging her tightly. As though responding to me, I felt her vagina vibrate slightly. It felt pleasant as it tightened around my dick, as though it was trying to suck up to the last drop of semen in my dick.

「Ahh… Ahh… Ahhh…♡ I love you…Ah… I love you so much…♡ Love you… ♡」

Mouth widely opened, she spoke incoherent words while saliva spilled out from her mouth. Her unfocused eyes appeared as though they were trying to find me, and her tongue—stuck out—was trembling.  I stuck out my tongue and embraced her lonely tongue.

I gently brushed her abdomen while savoring her warm and sticky tongue. Although I couldn’t slide my hand well due to the sweat, I felt comfortable because there was a sticky feeling that allowed me to clearly feel her warmth. My seed was inside this part where I was touching her. When I thought about that, I couldn’t help but feel a deep affection for her. 

「Haa, haa… I came a lot… It was great. You were really lovely today, Minith.」

「Aah…♡」

As her eyes remained unfocused, Minith sucked on my neck with unbelievable intensity. She kissed that one spot on my neck again and again, and she sucked my neck so hard that it made me wonder if there was a sap coming out. I could sense her strong desire, that she’d never let me go.

「What’s the matter? Why are you only kissing me on the neck? Isn’t here better?」

Seeing me tap my lips, Minith pouted her lips, looking as though she found it difficult to explain the reason.

「It’s ‘coz… I like it…」

I still couldn’t understand how that reason led her to kiss only my neck, but I’d just let her be. If she really wanted to suck on my neck, then so be it. I would suck her nipples later, so we’d be even. 

I caressed her head while letting her kiss me on the neck again.

「chu… nnmhー…」

I enjoyed the feeling of her arms and legs around me, as well as her lips on my neck. I could sense her deep affection for me. It seemed that it wouldn’t be long before my rod, which remained inside her, recovered back its glory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 56: Ate the Madly in Love Maid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We finally took a rest after I poured in my fourth batch of semen. Minith and I rubbed our sweaty bodies against each other, and marked the end of our lovemaking with a kiss.

「Haa… Haa… You squeezed me dry.」

「… aah…♡」

Minith had an orgasm several times while we were having sex, and her gaze was unsteady. I gently stroked her hair, waiting until she recovered her consciouness.

Chestnut-colored hair and black eyes. Minith didn’t have the colorful physical appearance found in the inhabitants of this world, like those with green hair and pink eyes. Seeing her somehow reminded me of my previous life, and I felt my heart calm down. Perhaps that was the reason why I got attracted the first time I laid my eyes on her. At that time, I still really missed my previous life.

I noticed a pair of black eyes staring straight at me.

「… Young Master.」

「Oh, you’ve recovered. I want you to stay here for the night, but will it be okay?」

Minith slid her hands on my skin, grabbed my hand, and entwined her fingers with mine. Then, she pulled our hands to her chest.

「Yeah… Before I left my house, I told my mom that I might spend the night here….」

She was apparently all prepared to stay and have sex on this date. As a reward, I’d decided to let her take a rest tomorrow.

「You can take a rest from work tomorrow. Rest your body well.」

After speaking, I noticed that my throat was very dry. However, my penis was still inserted inside Minith, and I also wanted to remain joined for a while. 

Turning to the corner of the room, I called out.

「Shadow, bring water for two.」 

A small silhouette took action along with a slight rustling of clothes. The figure picked up the pitcher on the table, carefully to not drop it, and poured water into the cups. 

Within the quiet room, the sound of water being poured down resounded well.  

「Eh…?」 

Minith’s face stiffened upon noticing the presence of another person. That person placed the cups on a tray and moved near the bed.  

The servant who was assigned to wait when their master was having sex with a woman and to provide help when needed was referred to as “shadow”. They could be ordered around, for example, to bring water when feeling thirsty. It was usually the ordinary employed servants who were assigned to work as shadow. However, the identity of the person couldn’t be known since shadow wore all-black clothing and a thin veil to cover the face. Shadow would move as long as “shadow” was called, so there was no need to know the person’s name.

There was a reason for such an arrangement. Many nobles felt embarrassed when a servant watched them having sex. Therefore, an unknown person called “shadow” was created to lessen the resistance. It was apparently more comfortable to think that some anonymous person in black was listening to their cries of pleasure, rather than a servant.  

Then, “rather than make such a troublesome arrangement, why not just get the water yourself?” The proud nobles preferred arranging a servant to stand by rather than do such things by themselves. 

I had never allowed a shadow to wait inside my room. However, this time, I’d especially arranged for one.

「Good work, you can step back.」 

Upon hearing my words, shadow quietly retreated to the corner of the room. After I passed the other cup of water to Minith, I drank down my cup.

「U-um…」 

「No need to worry. That person’s a woman, and she’s not a servant working in the castle.」  

Minith let out a sigh of relief.

Even though there was a rule that prohibited them from leaking out anything they heard or saw, Minith probably didn’t want to be seen having sex by a male coworker, especially after moaning so much in such a lovely fashion.

「In the first place, there’s no way I’d let another man see you naked. You’re only mine, after all.」  

「Yea…♡」 

This time, the servant who worked as shadow was Eve. When I encountered her in the hallway earlier, I thought about showing her our intimate love scene. And so, I assigned her the role of shadow. Later, I’d like to hear out her thoughts about my lovemaking with Minith. I couldn’t wait to hear her opinion.

「Hm… Eh…?」 

Minith moved her hands on the bed, trying to find something. Our lower halves were still joined, so she couldn’t move by much.

「What’s wrong?」 

「Ah, um, I’m trying to find my underwear…」

It seemed that she was searching for her string panty. I threw the panty down the bed, like I did every time. 

Calling out Eve again, I ordered her to pick up Minith’s underwear. At the same time, I also told her to prepare a handkerchief since Minith requested for one.

I thought that it might be a good idea to sleep while my penis remained inside Minith, but I decided to pull it out since I wanted to pee. For a moment, I considered taking a piss inside her vagina, and I felt like actually trying it out. However, I gave up the idea since it might destroy the intimate atmosphere. It would be better to do it in the heat of the moment during sex.  

「Minith, I’m pulling it out.」 

「Okay… Go ahead.」 

When she heard my intention to separate, Minith picked up the handkerchief on the pillow. Semen leaked out when I pulled my softened dick from her vagina which was loaded with semen.

「Mm…」 

As semen flowed out of her, Minith placed the handkerchief to cover her hole, and then she immediately put on her panty. Since she left the handkerchief to cover her entrance, the crotch area of her panty was protruding.

「Young Master’s sperm… What a waste…」 

Apparently, it was a strategy to prevent my semen from coming out. Lupetta did something similar the other day after we had sex; she inserted a pink gelatin, which prevented pregnancy, into her vagina. I found it amusing that they both covered the entrance of their vagina with a handkerchief and then wore a panty, but their goal was completely opposite.  

「I’ll clean it, okay?」  

Minith stuck out her red tongue as she closed in on my dick, which was completely covered in our body fluids. When I pushed it out towards her, she took in both my dick and balls inside her mouth at the same time.

「mmchu… nm… mmuap………」

She brushed my rod clean with piston-like movement. My dick had recovered some manliness, but it wasn’t completely back up yet. The way she moved, careful and gentle, felt very comfortable. I had the urge to take a piss inside her mouth, but I felt bad and gave up.

「Aah, it feels nice. You’re the best.」

The other girls were only forced to suck my dick, and worst of all, one of them almost vomited. It felt really great to have a woman voluntarily suck on your dick. Just this point alone made her worthy of being my woman. I could feel her warm tongue as it lovingly brushed on my glans, and it strengthened the sense of unity between us.  

「chumua… nm… nmmn… chu♡」 

Confirming that she was done after seeing her leave a kiss on the head of my penis, I placed my hand on her shoulder.

「Well done, you did an excellent job. I’ll carry you all the way to the clean bed, so rest well.」 

「Eh?」

After activating a body strengthening magic, I lifted Minith off her feet and carried her like a princess. As one would expect, it wouldn’t be an easy thing to carry someone taller than me, and on top of that, she was also heavier than Fanny. It would be lame if I were to fall over while carrying her, so I judged that it was better to use magic from the start. Minith wasn’t a magic user and was likely not sensitive towards the flow of magic, so she probably wouldn’t notice anything unusual.

「Whoa…!」 

Minith raised a joyful shout, feeling happy by the way I carried her like a princess. I laid her down on the second bed which had been prepared in advance.

Before I went into the bed, I secretly took a piss. Needless to say, there was no way that I could take a shit inside the room, but it was possible to pee since there was a urine bottle. I did feel slightly embarrassed by the urinating sound, though. 

Just as I was about to hold her hands after slipping into the blanket, Minith moved faster than me. She held my hand tightly and interlocked fingers. It seemed that she really loved to hold hands in this way.

「Young Master…」 

「What?」 

I caressed her other hand since she didn’t look like she had anything in particular to say. Then, a low and joyous sound leaked out from her throat. I brought my hand from the ends of her hair towards her back. Then, I moved it to her stomach through the side. In her stomach was my seed, locked up. Minith slipped into my chest like a child as I caressed her.

「I love you very much♡.」

I tightly embraced Minith and closed my eyes. A sense of safety was born from our closely entwined bodies, and it gently enveloped my consciousness.

Chapter 57: Letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as I woke up early in the morning, Minith mistook morning erection for sexual arousal, squeezing out my first cum of the day. My semen, which had just recovered during my sleep, scattered inside her vagina. It was a good work out to start off my day.

 Minith and I had our breakfast in the bedroom, which was filled with the after-sex smell. Afterward, she returned to her house. I granted her leave for the day. 

While walking through the hallway on my way to the castle, I caught sight of the back figure of a beautiful girl.

「Eve.」 

「Y-yes…!? M-master, is there anything I can help you with…?」  

Eve was preparing to head to her work at the Innovation Association when I spoke to her. Perhaps because she’d worked as shadow till late at night yesterday, Eve appeared slightly tired. 

「I have seen the documents that you copied, and I found that you’re handwriting still needs some improvement. I’ll have someone prepare a  practice board, so make sure to practice.」  

「I’m sorry…! P-please forgive me…! I’m very sorry…!」  

Eve dropped on her knees and begged with tears in her eyes. I got the feeling that she was a little too scared of me.

「I’m not angry. I know that you’re doing your best, so keep up the good work.」 

「Y-yes, t-thank you very much… I’ll do my best.」

Eve showed an indescribably complex expression before forcing a smile on her face.

 I pulled her pretty face close and intensely kissed her lips.

「mmh…!」 

「Puhaa… You’re a good girl. I love hardworking girls like you.」 

I released her lips and softly grabbed her breast. Just as I thought, Eve’s body was quite well-developed. Seeing how much she disliked it, I felt like teasing her even more. 

「nnmh… ahh… uhh…」 

I only intended to fondle her once, but my hand continued for a second  and then the third time. Gradually, my hand tightened its grab on her  breast. If I were to continue this, I might start making out with her  here in the hallway. 

When I blew air in her long elf ears, Eve raised a lovely cry and shrank down her neck. Before letting her go, I tilted her chip up with my finger and kissed her one last time. 

「I’ll give you plenty of love again tonight. Look forward to it.」 

「Yes…」 

Eve responded with a slightly strained smile.

When I returned to the castle, Fanny was in a very good mood for some reason. I was expecting her to sulk again since I didn’t spend the night here yesterday, so I felt disappointed. 

「Big brother, big brother! Have you read the letter?!」  

I caught Fanny’s body when she skipped towards me. Perhaps she was feeling excited, Fanny didn’t stop hopping despite being held by me.

「Letter?」 

「A letter has arrived from the royal capital. Mom will be coming back to Nyuneri! I can’t wait to see her!」  

Our mother had been going to the royal capital to socialize with other  nobles since the beginning of spring this year. Ever since she’d started  going, Fanny had been spending more time alone,  and this caused her to seek for attention. 

Levios Kingdom had been unstable these days. Thus, it was very important to  gather information by interacting with other nobles. Mother ended up doing the job since Father was preoccupied with other matters.  Incidentally, Father got his hands full with Grandfather, who’d been  picking fights with the nobles from Jinkaen Empire. 

「Mother’s returning to Nyuneri, huh. I hope she stays here for a while…」 

 「It was said in the letter that she won’t be leaving again this year. Fufufu.」   

Fanny beamed as she spoke. 

Considering the time, it was currently the season of harvest and then followed by winter. Elluo Continent had an unstable climate. Sometimes it snowed heavily like in Hokkaido, and at other times winter was warm like in Okinawa. 

In this world, there were specialists known as stargazers. They predicted the changes in the weather by reading the twinkling arrangement of stars in the sky at night. According to them, there wouldn’t be snow this year. Winter this year would probably be about the same as in the Kanto region.

Experienced stargazers were often correct in their predictions on the weather, so there was no need to worry much about the snow this year. I’d also tried to predict the weather back in the past, but I gave up after three days.

The arrangement of the stars made no sense. They changed every night, as though you were observing stars from an entirely different planet. Without the abundant knowledge accumulated by the stargazers over the years, forecasting was an impossible task.

There was little possibility of snowing this year, but there was still no absolute guarantee. I could understand why Mother decided to return at this point. It would be different if it was here in our territory, but Father definitely wanted to avoid the situation where Mother was stuck in the royal capital due to heavy snow. 

 「Winter is just around the corner, after all. You must be pretty excited.」

 「Yes! There are a lot of things I want to talk about with Mom. I also want to hear stories about the royal capital.」     

Fanny would most likely spend her nights with our mother once she returned here. This means that I could fully indulge in sex without getting disturbed. Just thinking about it made my lower half excited. 

 「Big brother, I’m thinking of having a tea after this. Would you like to accompany me?」   

「Sounds great.」 

「I was feeling pretty lonely since you weren’t here again last night. Let me here about some interesting things again.」 

Fanny smiled as she softly pulled my hand.  

It looked like she was indeed feeling lonely.

 I returned to my room after having tea with Fanny. Minith would usually  be here cleaning my room at this time, and then we’d have sex.  Unfortunately, she wasn’t working today. I felt kind of bored without any women around to bang. 

Thanks to the knowledge from my previous life, I was almost done with my education here. At the very least, I’d already learned about the things taught at the academy in the royal capital. Nowadays, I would just occasionally practice my social skills and pick up books to review. If  there was something that I hadn’t finished studying yet, I guess it  would be women. Since I was ordered by my father to learn about women, I must study well. And so, in order to further my studies, I summoned Tesh. 

「Investigate this person. If possible, I want to call her to my bedroom.」  

I handed over a wooden board which was stored in the desk to Tesh. The name of that busty woman at the church  as well as the location of the church were written on it. 

「Understood.」 

Father wouldn’t so easily allow me to have sex with her since she was a member of the Synod. When push comes to shove, I could search for something to use against her. I should also consider moving the spies that were raised at the Innovation Association. 

While I was imagining ways to eat her up on the bed, Tesh continued.

「Young master.」 

「Hm?」 

「We’ve confirmed the location of the inn where that adventurer called Lupetta is staying, including her schedule.」  

Lupetta was a member of the group led by Mergin. Naturally, they had their plans. Since they came here to earn money from the field nearby, they would sooner or later go there to explore it.

Adventurers who entered fields usually stayed inside for several days to weeks, depending on the situation inside. That was why Tesh already asked when they planned to venture into the field.

「They are currently gathering materials and information in the city, but they’ll check the site in about three or four days from now.」   

「I see.」 

Assuming you didn’t bring anything, it would take less than half a day by foot to reach the field near Nyuneri City from the castle. Not to mention they were all magic users, so they could probably get there and back in a day even if they had some items with them.

Many dangers lurked inside a field. In the worse-case scenario, Lupetta might not be able to make it out alive. I should have sex with her while she was still around, or else I might regret it. 

「I see. Tell her to come here tonight or tomorrow.」  

「Understood.」 

 I couldn’t wait to get in bed with Lupetta. For the time being, I should thoroughly think of different ways to love her on the bed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 58: Deliciously Eating the Struggling Adventurer (Part 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The point of my dick had gotten quite wet while I was working out a long-term plan for my future sex life. 

According to the servant who went to deliver the message to Lupetta, she was planning to act independently in the city today. In that case, sneaking out shouldn’t be a problem. 

And so, Lupetta was invited to my residence later that day.

「Young master, Lupetta-sama has arrived.」

Lupetta was treated as a guest in my residence since she responded to my invitation. The servants would also attend to her properly.

According to Tesh, she was currently in the bath.

「I see. Show her to my room once everything’s done.」

「Understood.」

It was already past noon, but there was still some time before dusk. The current time was probably around three o’clock.

It would probably be late by the time we finished having sex, so I instructed Tesh to prepare a delicious evening meal. Lupetta took a liking to the food here last time, and it wouldn’t be bad to reward her for obediently responding to my invitation today.

While I was immersed in reading a book by the window lit by the sun, someone lightly knocked on the door. The servants here wouldn’t knock in such a manner, so it was likely Lupetta. Just like previously, it was easy to tell that it was her based on the way she knocked.

「Enter.」

The door opened a second later after I gave permission.

Surprisingly, she was wearing a stylish two-piece dress instead of the usual babydoll dress. Considering that it was still bright outside, the two-piece was more suitable than a sexy babydoll dress.

The two-piece was a matching light purple with many pleats and strings, and a low-cut back. Dark blue crystal patterns were embroidered on the simple-looking skirt.

Perhaps sensing my observing gaze, Lupetta turned and covered her body.

「I have never worn a two-piece like this one… I feel like a rich lady, I’m not used to this.」

Based on the design and material used, her outfit would be considered fairly expensive by normal standards. Even though adventurers with magic power had better financial situations, it doesn’t change the fact that she was a commoner. If I remembered correctly, she was from a village called Vairburg or something. For someone who wasn’t even born in the city, she’d probably never even considered spending a large amount of money just for clothing. It was understandable when she said that she’d never worn these kinds of fancy clothes before.

Back when I’d just reincarnated, I also felt pained to spend a lot of money on clothing and armor. In my previous life, I was only an ordinary salaryman, and I was contented with cheap stuff. That was why I had quite a difficult time changing my perspective of money here.

「You look great in it even though it’s your first time. Really beautiful.」

I stood up from the bed and held her waist.

「… That’s not true.」

「I’m not lying.」

「You’re lying.」

「I’m telling you the truth. You look very attractive.」

Lupetta looked strangely nervous, so I let her sit down on the bed first. 

When I sat down next to her, Lupetta stood up and put some distance between us before sitting down again. Then, she turned her silver eyes on my direction, looking as though she wanted to ascertain something.

「Is there something you want to say?」

Lupetta opened her mouth slightly before shortly closing it again, hesitating whether to say it.

I adjusted myself into a position facing Lupetta, and gently pressed my palm on her flat chest. As expected, it was as flat as a pancake. 

「Um…」

「Hm? If you have something to say, then say it.」

「Having an affair… are you really okay with this?」

What was she talking about? If she was talking about the fact that she was cheating on Mergin, I didn’t really care. If she were to fall in love with me, then that wouldn’t be bad too.

While I was trying to understand the meaning behind her words, Lupetta realized that she didn’t explain enough, so she continued.

「That beautiful woman yesterday is your girlfriend, right? You shouldn’t cheat on her…」

Now that she mentioned it, Minith and I met Lupetta at the church yesterday during our date. Lupetta seemed to have assumed that Minith was my girlfriend after seeing her being together with me.

While I quietly listened, Lupetta continued.

「That person looked like she really loves you.」

Apparently, Lupetta jumped to a conclusion after seeing Minith for the first time. She thought, Ah, did she also surrender her body for something? Or is she simply being threatened? 

And then, after Mergin and the others had finished their business at the church and they were about to leave, there was a man and woman who were flirting in front of the church. What’s more, the two went behind the church and started kissing each other passionately. Having peeked at everything that happened, Lupetta concluded that Minith was my girlfriend.

「You’re in a serious relationship, right?」

After returning to the inn, Lupetta remembered the intense kissing scene and thought very hard about it. After racking her brain, Lupetta came to an amusing conclusion.

They are lovers who will eventually marry each other in the future. The woman looked like she wants to bear his child, too. 

As a commander in the Quordentz Army, he has both status and money. He can get married any time he wants. Unlike knights, he is a commoner, so he can marry the person he really loves. 

Perhaps the reason he wasn’t aware about contraceptives was because that woman is keeping it a secret from him. Well, that woman looked the same age as me, so she would be over twenty-years-old by the time he turned adult and she could get pregnant with his child. It would be slightly late if that’s the case, so perhaps that’s the reason why she’s getting desperate?

Apparently, that was how Lupetta thought about the situation. 

I felt like she turned Minith into a black-bellied woman.

The average age for an ordinary woman to get married and pregnant was low, and that was especially the case for those who lived in small villages. Women who were over twenty-years-old and not pregnant yet were in the minority group. Considering that point, Lupetta might get counted in the minority group in her village. Perhaps she was also feeling impatient deep down.

Anyway, Lupetta believed that I was going to marry Minith sooner or later. Thinking up to that point, Lupetta suddenly thought. Wouldn’t our relationship be considered as an affair?

Lupetta’s explanation ended there, but I could tell why she told me all these things. Long story short,  She’s pitiful, so don’t cheat on her anymore. Let’s stop this relationship, okay?

I gently pinched Lupetta’s nipple.

「Mmnn… I feel bad for her.」

Minith was a maid, and she was more knowledgeable on matters about nobles than most commoners. She was also aware that she could never become my official wife.

In the first place, the servants in the castle knew that I bought a sex slave. Even though there was no official announcement, a beautiful elf had been bought so suddenly. It was easy for them to guess the reason she was bought.

Minith also knew that I was having sex with other women, so there was no problem even if I slept with Lupetta. Lupetta believed that I was a successful commoner, so she never considered the common practice of nobility and thought that I was just having an affair.

However, this misunderstanding was convenient for me, so I decided not to correct her.

 「Lupetta, it’s your fault for being so attractive. I didn’t really want to cheat on her, but you seduced me.」 

I groped her flat chest and rubbed her tight ass.

「… That’s, not true.」

「You really think that I’m lying? That I’m not attracted to you?」 

Lupetta remained silent.

During the first time we had sex, I complimented her again and again, and I even stated my reason for saying them. The reason she couldn’t honestly take the compliment was probably due to her complex.

 「It doesn’t matter even if I love another woman. Let’s just enjoy this moment, okay? You and I, we are both cheating on the person we love. See? Let’s get along well and comfort each other. Don’t worry, Mergin definitely won’t find out about our relationship. 」 

Lupetta silently looked down.

She thought she could escape from our relationship after explaining things. However, forget about escaping from our relationship, she was even treated as a companion in this affair.　

「Please, don’t ever tell this to Mergin.」

Lupetta turned a resolute gaze, so I smiled at her and grabbed her hand.

She also asked the same thing last time, but she probably asked again just to make sure.

「No problem. However, you’ll have to be honest when you’re together with me, understand? If you tell any lie, then our agreement might turn into a lie too. 」

「… Got it.」

Lupetta nodded thoughtfully with her eyes remaining serious.

I closed the distance between us and gently hugged her. She was small and cute.

 「What made you feel good last time? Tell me about it.」 

「It’s embarrassing, I cant say it.」

… So she wasn’t going to deny that she felt good.

Chapter 59: Enjoying the Female Adventurer Who Resists Our Affair (Part ⅔)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I repeatedly kissed the back of her neck. I can’t kiss her mouth since I promised her that it was off-limits. I would be breaking my promise if I don’t hold back.

「Lupetta, you’re so cute. You’re adorable」

「Mnn…」

Since she’s unwilling to have sex with me, her expression in bed has been stiff the entire time. But when I kindly compliment her, she would crack a shy smile. And then her expression would immediately tighten and revert back to an expressionless one.

I’m fully aware that she wasn’t used to being complimented by a man, but her reactions are so adorable every time.

「Take a look at this」

When I removed my belt and lowered my underwear, my cock stood tall like it was going to stick to my lower abs. 

I took Lupetta’s hand while she had an unpleasant look on her face, and made her touch my cock that had veins popping out.

「What do you think about it after touching it?」

「…It’s like a muscle」

「It became this big since you’re a good woman, Lupetta. Here, try getting a good feel of it. You can see it clearly since it’s still bright, right? Take this chance to study it so you can be ready when you do this with Mergin in the future」

Lupetta had a look of unwillingness, but perhaps because I mentioned that it was for the sake of Mergin, or I had simply got her curious, she was really getting into touching my cock with her hand. 

As soon as I thought that she was measuring the thickness of my shaft with her fingers, she pulled the skin down from the tip of my cock and looked at the base of the glans. Then, she put her other hand under my balls and juggled them as if she was weighing them. 

Clear liquid started to leak from the tip of my cock as it got excited from her unsteady hands.

「Eek」

Lupetta took her hand off my cock as if she was trying to escape from the clear liquid that started to drip out. I moved closer to her and was about to start undressing her. However, since the strings on her top were just for design, there was no meaning in untying them. Her top could only be taken off of her if she throws her arms up in the air.

「Mmm…Ahh」

I slipped my hands in her top from the space between her top and her skirt. Then, I started to massage her smooth, small breasts.

It seems that she was wearing a camisole type of underwear underneath. She showed an unpleasant expression as her shoulders trembled when I pinched her nipples.

Her nipples are bendy and truly nice to touch. I would surely rank the elasticity of her nipples first amongst all the girls I’ve slept with so far. 

「Here, lie down」

I lightly pushed Lupetta down on the bed.

Then, with my hands that were inside of her top, I tried to lift that part of the cloth up. It seems like I could easily poke my head in there.

「Ehh…Wh-what are you?」

I lifted both her top and her camisole type of underwear at the same time and plunged my head into the “tunnel” that I created.

I traveled up past her stomach and arrived at her breasts. She wriggled her body left and right as she tried to resist, but she could not get away due to my body pinning her down at her upper thighs. 

 

「Hiiii! Y-you’re tickling me!」

I placed my face at the spot where I would be normally be sandwiched by the girl’s breasts and took a sniff. The faint scent that’s mixed of the nice smell of soap and probably her sweat tickled my nostrils as it drifted in my nose.

I could clearly tell even in the dimness inside of her clothes that her nipples that I was playing with earlier were still erect.

I asserted myself and gently put my mouth on one of her nipples. I’m a little sad that her breasts are so small.

「Sto-, Nnn, y-you’re tickling m…! Kahha, noo, y-you’re tickling me!」

She resisted as she trembled slightly with a laughing voice.

Since my face and hair was touching her bare skin inside of her clothes, I was probably tickling her.

She didn’t like it, but to me, it felt very nice.

「Ahh….Hiii…Aaaha…Mnnnn…Kuhh…」

I sucked on her nipple in this cramped up, dimmed space while I felt her warmth. How do I put it? This puts my heart at ease.  

I licked and sucked and nibbled. She tried to limit my movements by putting her arms around my head over her clothes, but I ignored her and continued to work my mouth.

「Oh no. Ahh, it tickles! Kuhaha, n-nooo. Don’t lick me…Kuhuhu」 

As if Lupetta’s breasts were completely not developed as an erogenous zone, she wasn’t feeling it no matter how much I licked her there.

It was really fun to suck on her tits that felt like gummy candy but hearing her laugh like that when I touch her is going to make my cock wither too.

「That was delicious. You have nice breasts」

I took my head back out of her clothes and looked at Lupetta, who had a slightly red face.

I don’t know if she cried because she hated what I was doing or because she was forced to laugh too much, but there were tears shining around her eyes

「…They aren’t nice. Not breasts like these」

As I thought, she had an inferiority complex about her loli type body and her lacking breasts. Well, I can understand why she would.

I rubbed those overly gentle hills over her soft clothes.

「M-Mergin tells me that I’m like a kid…! And Mr.Captain, your lover too…She’s so big…」

To add on to that, Minith’s breasts are about average for her age, they weren’t big and they weren’t small. 

As I silently stroked her chest, she started to whine like the time before about Mergin and his adventurer companion, “that girl”.

I occasionally chimed in with a remark and agreed with her as I pretended to listen to Lupetta’s story.

I casually touched her body gently and caressed her, messing up her clothes, but she did not care since she was absorbed in venting her complaints. Well, she might just be doing that on purpose to distract herself from the reality that she is going to be held by a guy that she didn’t really care about.

「Lupetta」

I placed my hand on her thigh and called her name.

After I told her not to resist with my eyes, her legs opened up. The angle of her legs went from 0 degrees to 30, then 60, and 90.

Although the center of her private area was still hidden because of her skirt, she became silent and her expression intensified as if she thought about what was about to come.

「Uu….u, uuu」

She displayed her will to resist with a voice that had no words, but without caring, I moved before her crotch area.

Just like how I dove into her chest area before, this time, I dove right into her skirt. Lupetta’s silver-colored eyes opened wide as if she guessed what I was going to do.

「Ah, No! Stop! You can’t!」

When I plunged my head in her skirt, she put her hands on my head over the fabric of her skirt like she was trying to stop my advances. Then, her two thighs came closing in on me.

When I kissed those thighs that came in to interrupt me, she opened her legs back up again to a 90-degree angle as if she was surprised by me.

「Nooo……AHHHH!」

When I got to the deepest part of her skirt, there was a pair of string panties waiting there. It was hard to tell the color of the panties because it was dark inside of her skirt, but I think it was probably dark blue. 

I put my nose in her pubic area so I could enjoy her scent.

「Uuuuhh…Nooo….Don’t lick me there…」

The fragrance of her soap was so strong that I couldn’t smell her faint scent at all. Even though I wanted a sniff so bad. What should I do then? I guess I’ll just have to increase her scent.

「Ah?! Ahhh……!」

I untied the string of her panties and took them off.

Inside her dim skirt, Lupetta’s most precious place was defenselessly exposed.

「*Hiii!*」

Even though her pubic hair was touching my nose, I used my tongue to get a taste of her entire private area. It was moist and soft, but it wasn’t really salty. There wasn’t really a taste to it.

「Hii! Again?! N-noo! No!」

I firmly restrained her legs when she started to move violently and continued to lick her entire pussy like a wild dog.

With one of my hands, I opened that place up as if I was making a peace sign.

「Ah, ahh, AHHHHh…Stop…No….Ahhh…Uuuu」

Her small vagina with the beautiful color of flesh was slightly shaking like a living organ. I traced her clitoris that was covered by a fold of skin with my tongue and stimulated it as it kept shaking.

「AhhhHHHhh……! UnnnnnnnnnaaaaAHHHH…Uahhhh…Ah, ahh, ahhh, T-there, ahh, Ah」

As I moved my tongue, she recalled the pleasure spots that she learned when I held her in bed the other time. 

The more she got stimulated, the louder her voice got. The more fluid came out of her, the stronger her scent became.

「NnnaaaahHhhhhhh, AH, AH, right there…Nnn, ah, ahhh, Unnmnn, nnn, Ahhhhhh」

The inside of her skirt was filled with her scent.

Perhaps her soggy honey pot is looking for a man’s cock to fill it, she then opened her mouth in a lewd way,

「HNnn…Ahh, don’t do it there, I’m becoming weird…AHHhhh….Nnnnnn….R-right there, that place, NOOo…」

Her sweaty thighs were gently sandwiching my head. Her hands that were behind my head strengthened as if she was pulling my face closer to her pussy. She was probably unconsciously seeking for pleasure.

After I got a complete grasp on the spots that turned her on, I continued to slowly caress her. Slowly, slowly, lewdly and persistently.

「Nnn…Ahhh, ahh……NOoo……Nooo, I-I’m scared, I’m scareddd…Ahh, stop, I’m going crazy, I’m scared…AhhhHhh, ah, aHhhh」

When I could hear her rough breathing from even under her skirt, she began moaning as if she was crying.

Then, her hands that were pulling my face in earlier are now trying to push me away.

「No, G-get…get away from me already…y.y…?! I-I’m going crazy! No! Nonono! AhhHHhhh?! Mergin! Help me, Merginnnn! Noooo?! I’m turning weirdddd! Noooo!!」

She was really trying hard to push my head away, but I fought against it and kept on stimulating her secret place. Contrary to her crying voice, her hips were slightly raised in the air like she wanted me to keep licking her.

In response to that, I attacked all the sweet spots at once at a timing when her voice became loud.

「Uuuuu! I’m scared! No-Nooo! Ahhh!! AHHHHHH!!」

She tightened her thighs with all her strength and squeezed my head tight.

Then, the next moment, Lupetta screamed out loudly as if someone was carving her skin with a sword. Her hips suddenly arched towards the air, then immediately dropped back down. 

Surprised by her screams and movements, I took my head back out and looked at her.

「Uuu……Uunnn……Uuuu……*Sniff*…UuuuuuUu……」

She covered her face with both of her arms crossed and started to cry. Her face that was red all the way to her ears is now wet with tears and drool. She quivered occasionally as if she was having hiccups.

「Lupetta. You’re adorable」

I lay down next to her and hugged her. 

「That felt good, right?  Good girl. You’re a good girl, Lupetta. That wasn’t anything bad at all. You did great. Look, there’s no need to be scared anymore」

I praised her and softly brushed her hair with the arms that I had around her.

Her cries became louder again, but she did not resist me.

The fact that I satisfied her sexually stimulated me even more. This is what being a man is all about.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 60: Enjoying the Female Adventurer Who Resists Our Affair (Part 3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I tried to gently hold Lupetta’s hand because I saw her looking up at the ceiling absent-mindedly, she smacked my hand away.

Even though she was fine with me brushing her hair, she didn’t seem like she wanted to hold hands with me. It’s really hard to understand how she thinks.

Since I can’t do anything about that, I just whispered sweet words in her ear and gently stroked her hair. 

She was docile for the next little while as I doted on her, but after the feeling of climax seems to have faded for her, she looked at me and spoke in a quiet voice,

「…Don’t…be so nice to me…」

「Why?」

She did not respond to my question, but she started to struggle and tried to push me away. I stopped hugging her because of that and our close body contact came to an end.

After she confirmed that our bodies separated, she immediately put her hands on her face again and began to cry. She called out the name of the person she likes numerous times before she cried her heart out like she was calling for help.

If she tells me not to be nice to her like that, it would only make me want to be nice to her.

「You did nothing wrong, Lupetta. It’s alright. Don’t worry. This is a secret just between the two of us 」

I patted her head with our bodies apart.

Then, *slap*! *slap*! *slap*!. While she kept her face hidden, she hit my hand away like a cat that was pawing at me.

Since she didn’t seem like she wanted to be touched, I got off the bed to prepare for the main show. While I was at it, I drank some water from the water jug. Eve was still working so today there were no “shadows” attending to me. 

I pushed the mirror that was sitting in the corner of the room to the front of the bed. Even though there were small wheels attached to the wooden stand that supported the mirror, it was still quite heavy. It seems like it’d be very hard for servants who can’t use magic to move it. 

「Hey, Lupetta. Take a look at this」

「…What do you want this time?」

The trapezoid-shaped mirror is about the size of an average Japanese home’s front door from my past life. A piece of cloth with beautiful embroidery covered the mirror for dust protection.

After I took the cloth off, the beautiful, polished surface of the mirror appeared, displaying me, and Lupetta, who had teary eyes.

「A huge mirror……」

I went around her and hugged her from behind. When I put my chin on her shoulder, the mirror reflected our faces side by side next to each other.

「You felt good just now, didn’t you? Now it’s my turn, right?」

「Uuu…There’s no way that felt…」

「I think you’re adorable when you’re being honest though, Lupetta」

I spoke with a big smile as if I was smiling at her through the mirror.

「What did I say about what would happen if you lie to me?」

「Ah…hh……」

We made a promise that if Lupetta lies to me, my promise to keep our affair from Mergin will become a lie too. She looked down immediately probably because she had recalled the promise as well.

「I’ll help you take your clothes off」

After I had her put her arms straight up and took her top off, a dark blue camisole appeared. My crotch became stiff as I looked at her reflection in the mirror.

The camisole suited her small boobs very well. Its dark color makes the outlines of her breasts harder to see, resulting in it being more difficult to determine the size of her breasts. Whether she was aware of it or not, this visual effect with the desperate aim of covering up how small her breasts were was so adorably pitiful that seeing it made me hard. In short, it was “moe”. However, her outfit this time was probably something that was prepared by a servant.

After I thought it was a bit of a shame to take off the camisole, I removed the clasp of her skirt next and her skirt slipped right off. Since I have already untied the string of her panties when I went down on her with my tongue just earlier, her soggy private area that’s covered in pubic hair was suddenly exposed.

「*Eeek*…N-noo…」

Lupetta was struggling like a cat that’s forcefully being held so I put in some strength to stop her from escaping as I brought her movements under control.

「Hey, don’t run away. It’s finally bright right now, so let me get a good look at your most precious area」

I could see from the mirror that Lupetta’s expression was dyed in shame.

I put my arms around her in a way that restrained her arms. Then, after I felt her resistance weaken, I used a hand to open up her tightly closed crotch.

「Ahh……Ahhh, no…don’t look. Don’t look……」

「You don’t have to be so embarrassed. It’s really beautiful. You’re adorable, Lupetta」

I whispered into her ear as the mirror showed her nicely opened up crotch. Then, I took a good look at her vagina that was wet like a tropical rain forest after a storm had passed. 

「Don’t look! Aaaaah!」

Whether she was excited by the stimulus from my fingers or by seeing herself in the mirror, her slimy love juice started to overflow again.

When I plunged a hand into her camisole and grabbed her nipple, it was shockingly hard already. Her body was absolutely ready to be penetrated.

「Try standing up a little」

It was hard to explain to Lupetta exactly how I wanted her to position, so I had her stand up for the time being. Then, I immediately told her to squat down on me like I was a Japanese style squat toilet.

「*Eek*……!」

My hard cock pointed upward as if it was waiting to penetrate her. When Lupetta looked in the mirror in front of us, she got scared and tried to stand back up as if she was trying to escape.

「Just sit down like that and take it in, okay?」

With her back facing me, she’ll be sitting on it in a reverse cowgirl position.

I lightly slapped her ass and urged her to do it.

「Ahh……I-I don’t want this…why, why am I…」

She descended so slowly that I almost thought she was teasing me. Slowly squatting down like that takes some muscle, but as expected of an adventurer, she was well trained. Due to the strength she’s using, the muscles on her calves and thighs were showing, making the beauty of her healthy pair of legs very noticeable. 

I felt my spear get even harder and the tip of it became wet as it waited to pierce her.

「*Hhiiiii*?!」

The tip of my cock gently touched the lips of her vagina.

However, maybe because the positioning or the angle was bad, my cock slipped and went between her buttcheeks. It would have been pretty painful if it bent the other direction.

「There’s no need to rush. Try again」

She squatted back up a little before she immediately began going down on it again. I adjusted the position of my cock this time and aimed it at where her vagina was.

「Lupetta. Stop right there」

Our reflection in the mirror froze. It looked like she was about to squat on my cock.

After double-checking the angle quickly, I put a hand on her shoulder. 

「Good, now sit down on it on my signal」

As I held onto the shaft of my cock and made slight adjustments, I pressed down on her shoulder with my left hand to guide her. I felt like I was working some heavy machinery in a construction job. 

「Aahh!」

*Chuu*, when I heard such a lewd sound, the connection was safely established.

Her beautiful back and neck covered my field of vision. I moved a little bit beside her neck and looked at the mirror from over her shoulder, but I couldn’t really see the part of my dick going in her clearly since her body was slightly leaning forward.

From the feeling that was transmitted to my cock, I could tell that we were connected. It felt hot and very tight. It almost feels like I had really pierced her with a spear.

「Ah…Ahhh…haaa…hahhhh……ah…Ahh…」

While Lupetta’s legs were shaking, her butt was still floating in the air. No matter how well-trained she is, her legs will probably cramp if she remains in a posture like that for too long.

I put my hands around her waist and gently pulled her down.

「Ugh…….Hhh……ughh….Ah, Ahhh…hahh….」

It felt so good when Lupetta’s plump butt touched my thighs. The intense rubbing from her vaginal walls made me want to cum right away.

I pushed her hips out just a little to adjust the angle so that I could see my dick going in her from the mirror. While I did that, I opened her legs wide.

「Look. Can you see us becoming one?」

「AhhHHHHhhh, SSstopppp……」

The scene of my cock penetrating her was being reflected in the mirror.

Due to us doing it with her on top like this, it was a little exhausting for my body, but the visuals were nice.

The reason her vagina began tightening on me so indecently was probably because she was being shown the scene of her own mating. As I got drunk from the pleasure, I drooled a little and it stained her camisole.

「I’m inside of you Lupetta…Do you feel me in there as well?」

I wanted her to see this. This raw scene of us having sex. This scene where the cock of a man she doesn’t love penetrates her most precious place. 

I wanted her to realize that she’s no longer the girl that Mergin knows.

After I hugged her body tightly, I put one of my hands on her breast and slid my other hand to her pubic region.

「Nno…Stop…」

I used my fingers to attack her vagina’s weak spots that I learned when I tongued her. Slowly and calmly, I did it with a patient spirit that’s ready for a long battle.

*Chu*, *chu*, *chu*, I continued to kiss her neck as I ran my fingers around her breast like I was tracing the soft parts of it.

「Mnnn, Ahhh…Ahhhhh…, Mmn…Ah…AH, AHHH, right there…Mnn」

My fingers were drenched in her love juice in no time. She was leaking out so much that it was almost like she was peeing.

「Here?」

「Aaah! Mnnn…S-stop…Nnn! Ahh, haa, haaaa…N-no…N-no…Nnnn!」

I have probably gotten somewhat better at this now compared to the first time since Lupetta was moaning out nicely. I continued to my hands without reserve to caress her. My cock was telling me to start pounding her quickly and ejaculate but I endured the temptation and kept on teasing her.

「Nnnnnn…AaaaaHHh…AHhhh…AAAAAAHHHH…N-ahhh, right there…Nnnnn…M-more…Ah, ahhh…Mn, mn, mnn, nn, ahhh, haa,haaa, Ah, ah, Ahhhh, ah, AHHhh……」

When Lupetta looked like she was about to cum, I stopped working my fingers. Her silver eyes that could be seen in the mirror were moist as she moaned while climbing the stairs of pleasure.

I couldn’t wait any longer either. I decided to use my cock that has just been idle inside of her to fuck her thoroughly.

「Lupetta. Let’s feel good together」

「Ahh…Aah, AAH! Haaa…haaa…!」

I adjusted my hip’s position so I could move easier. But perhaps because of our awkward posture, there is some distance between my cock and her vagina, making it hard for me to go balls deep in her. Lupetta was half gone in the sea of pleasure herself, so she didn’t seem like she could afford to change our sex position to the way I want her either.

Since there wasn’t much I could do about that, I started to thrust my hips as it is with the shallow connection.

「Ah……! Ah……! Ahh……!」

I moved carefully so that I wouldn’t explode as well. I wanted to take my time to enjoy her vagina. 

「Ahh! Ahhh…this feels amazing, Lupetta」

The backside of my penis felt really good as it grinded against the slightly rough part of her vagina. It was so good that I unintentionally moaned out. 

To get another taste of that sensation, I pulled my hips back slightly, and then I thrusted again. 

「Ughh…! Good. It feels so good」

「Mnnnnnnuuu! NNNnnnAhhh! Ahhhhhhhhh!」

I was entranced by the rough sensation rubbing my cock. The only thing that was in my mind was to use that place to please my cock. I pulled and thrusted, pulled and thrusted.

Lupetta seemed to be feeling good as well. Her voice was wild and every time my cock went in, her love juice made a watery and lewd sound. 

As we both breathed intensely, I felt myself reaching my limit.

When I hugged Lupetta as hard as I could when I felt like ejaculating, it looked like that was her last straw as well. 

「AH, Ahhh! Ahh, STOP, STOP IT ALREADY! I’M TURNING WEIRD! I’M GOING CRAZY! I’M SCARED! I’M SCAREDDD!! NONONONO! I’M GOING TO BREAK! STOPPP!!! AHHHHHhhh!」

「Lupetta! Lupetta!! I’m- I’m cumming!」

「NOOOOONONONOOO!」

The exact moment I reached climax, my sweetly bound cock plopped out of her vagina.

But I could no longer stop myself from cumming. My cock faced towards nothingness and began spraying semen out to the fullest.

The semen that was unleashed from my cock displayed a jump that seemed like it would reach the sky, and it didn’t just get on her breasts, but on my face as well.

「AAAAaahHHH!!」

Then, Lupetta climaxed in her own fashion. The back of her head hit my chest hard as she threw her head back. After that, her head shook back and forth as it hit my chest again and again.

「Mm?」

For some reason, my thighs felt warm. Just when that thought came to my mind, I realized that she was taking a leak. A light yellow liquid was spreading on the bedsheet. 

「Ah……Ahhhee…Nnm…Ahhhhhh…Ahhh…Ah…?」

Without realizing that she started leaking, Lupetta looked at the yellowed bedsheet with a blank expression.

Then, when she stopped peeing, she closed her eyes and passed out. Her consciousness might have gotten flushed out together with her pee.

With her eyes closed and a satisfied expression on her face, I kissed her softly on the cheek. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 61: Dinner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tesh informed us that dinner was ready and guided us to a new location.

I initially wanted to eat with Lupetta together in the bedroom, but since she pissed all over the place there, I made Tesh prepare another room for us. I did like the smell right after she pissed, but it only smelled like mere excrement a few minutes after that.

That is why I didn’t want to eat in that bedroom. For better or worse, it didn’t seem like I had that kind of fetish.

After we entered a different room that Tesh prepared, food immediately started to be served.

The types of cutlery were also slightly arranged so that even Lupetta, who didn’t know the proper etiquette, could eat comfortably. 

「I have prepared some good food for you today as well. Eat as much as you like」

「……Unn」

With a slight smile on her face, Lupetta grabbed the knife and fork in front of her.

She started to use her knife on the steak without feeling particularly reserved. I thought that she was a surprisingly tidy person as I watched her stab her fork into the steak and cut it all up into cubes.

Her lower body was occasionally fidgeting as if she was holding in an urge to pee. That might be caused by the contraceptive.

I shot my entire load outside this time since I couldn’t release it in her. On top of that, my mood died down after she pissed herself so we did not go for a second round. Yet she still shoved the contraceptive in there and said just in case.  

「This is delicious」

「Is that so? This dish is good too, you know?」

「Which one?」

People who eat good food will become happy. Lupetta was pretty much no exception to this rule as her stiff expression changed into a smile right away.

「Lupetta, how long have you been an adventurer for? I don’t really know much about adventurers so I’d like to hear more about them from you」

A conversation is the basics of communication. Contrary to my expectations, even Lupetta who comes off as the “cold loli type” really likes to talk about herself.  

Since this was a rare chance, I wanted to hear more about people who make a living as adventurers. I mostly just hear about them in rumors and I have never really talked much with one directly.

「Mm…since I was a kid」

Her body is still like a kid’s right now but I’m not going to be rude and randomly roast her like that.

「At what age did you start?」

「I don’t know. Around five?」

I wonder if the five-year-old Lupetta looked like a Koropokkurru doll. I imagined her to be pretty adorable but I did not get an erection from it. My strike zone is in the two digits. I’m no lolicon.  

While I had such thoughts in mind, Lupetta swallowed the steak she put in her mouth and continued to talk.

「My home village was really close to a “field”. That’s why I have been going in there to hunt magic beasts since I was young. That’s how adventurers make money」

Lupetta then stabbed her fork into a slightly bigger piece of steak and stuffed it in her mouth.

As her jaws moved, her eyes narrowed as she smacked her lips.

「You entered a field since you were five? That’s amazing」

「*Nom nom*…Mmm…but I was the only one who had magic power in my village. I was the strongest person there」

A simple commoner and a commoner with magic power could not be compared to each other in terms of battle capabilities.

If a commoner with no magic power is a mouse, then a commoner with magic power would be a cat. Since their strength standard is different in the first place, a fight between them would be a waste of time.

A cornered rat can become a cat, and people could also be caught off guard. But that aside, if they fought each other in a direct one vs one, the person that has magic power will definitely win. Even if it’s a five-year-old girl.

「Since the lord raised the taxes to prepare for war, my village was already in big trouble when I was born. It’s natural for me to work hard when I possess magic power」

「So why are you all traveling all over the place as an adventurer? You wanted to work away from home?」

「…That’s part of it. The other part is because the lord seemed to want to draft me into his army so I ran away」

「Ahh, since you have magic power 」

「Yeah」

Soldiers with magic power have many uses since they could use magic. Scouting for sure, but they could also be messengers, healers, night time lookouts, and bodyguards for the generals. If there are only a few of them, you could train their stamina up and form a highly mobile unit. Just one person with magic power joining alone could add a wide range of strategies to the army.

To note, our family pays the people with magic power very well after they are hired as officers. However, it seems that the lord of the region Lupetta lived in was stingy and doesn’t really pay his people well. She seemed to have judged that in her case, it was better to leave the village to work as an adventurer and support her village by sending money back. 

She said some extreme words like her village was still suffering from heavy taxes even now, and the lord should just hurry up and die in the war. For the villagers, it doesn’t matter who the lord is as long as they keep the village safe and the taxes low. 

「This salt is delicious too. What a nice aroma」

There was a block of rock salt served on a plate. It was a block of light yellow-colored rock salt the size of a child’s fist.

Lupetta took that block of rock salt and shaved it with a grater to sprinkle some on top of her steak. 

The flavor of that salt is mild. It’s a Nyuneri produced salt that has a faint scent similar to Japanese cypress.

When I was just reincarnated, the smell of this salt always made me feel like I entered a Japanese cypress bath, but I have grown accustomed to it recently.

「That rock salt is from the field of Nyuneri, so you can eat that all the time from now on since you guys will be going in there」

「Really? I look forward to it」

The fog that envelops the “fields” not only spawns magic beasts, it also alters the terrain and the environment inside. For that reason, the inside of a field is almost completely different from the outside. 

This is an extreme example, but if there are fields out there that are forever snowing inside, there would be fields that are just plain deserts too. Since the environment and terrain can be that distorted, there are times where humans could find useful minerals and materials inside as well.

In the field near the city of Nyuneri, it seems that you could find lots of that kind of rock salt once you go deep inside.

From history, the city of Nyuneri all started from a base for collecting that rock salt. It expanded into a village, then into a town before becoming the Nyuneri today. The city is now the biggest source of salt supplies in this region that’s far away from the sea.

「Lupetta, Did any special products come out of the fields that you’ve gone into when you were a child?」

「Nope. Things like Nyuneri’s salt or the royal capital’s mirror stone are rare」

「You can get mirror stones from the field of the royal capital?」

「Yup」

Mirror stones are stones that you make mirrors with. Even an unrefined one can reflect light like a mirror. Their appearance is like rocks that have a reflective coating all around them.

After you use a hammer and a chisel to hammer down the mirror stone’s rough surface, you cut it in half with a knife. Then, the cross-section will look like the mirrors from Japan in my past life.

In the continent of Elluo, mirrors aren’t something that’s produced in workshops. Instead, they are made by breaking up mirror stones.

「I really didn’t like that flatland that had mirror stones laying around everywhere 」

Lupetta told me that it’s really hard to find your way inside the field of the royal capital since it was a natural maze of mirrors.

「The mirror I used earlier might have been made in the royal capital too then」

The giant mirror that reflected our mating session was of course made from mirror stones too. Even though I kept the knowledge I had in my past life, I never learned how mirrors were made.

Lupetta’s face turned red as she cast her eyes down when I mentioned the mirror from earlier.

「Um…I’m sorry…about the bed……」

She was probably referring to how she wet the bed.

If I mocked her or scolded her here, I think she will be dispirited from here on.

「That was you being honest, right? You don’t need to apologize for that. The Lupetta who didn’t lie was a very good girl」

「……Uu」

「I wanted you to feel good, Lupetta. I was really happy」

I said that while sounding as serious as I possibly could. Then, while she kept her head down, I continued to throw words at her like I was seizing the moment.

It’s a good thing that you felt good, it’s good to cum, and moaning isn’t anything to be ashamed about. I affirmed everything that she was ashamed of and shifted all the responsibility to my doing.

「…Okay? That’s why I want you to tell me if you felt good and what makes you feel good」

「T-that kind of…It’s embarrassing」

「Why?」

「Because…T-that’s like…dirty….Mergin will…hate me too…」

……No, wouldn’t Mergin like you more if you were more lewd? He probably would.

I was thinking that but I didn’t say it out loud.

I mean, I don’t think she will be able to find out anyway if she’s going to pretend to be all pure when they do it. From what I know from Lupetta’s rants, I can’t imagine Mergin to not be a virgin.

「Lupetta. We promised to never leak our relationship to Mergin, right?」

「Yeah」

「Do you think I’ll lie to you? Have I broken any of our promises so far? Think about it」

Mergin was released, and I have yet to kiss Lupetta’s lips. From her perspective, I have never broken any promises.

「You haven’t」

「So rest assured. I absolutely won’t tell Mergin. No matter what you do in this mansion, he will never find out about it」

I got up from my seat and sat down next to Lupetta. Then, I grabbed her hand.

Since I felt that she tried to pull her hand away, I put more power into holding it. Then, I stared directly in her eyes. They were silver just like mine.

「You can’t show your dirty side to the person that’s the most important to you, right?」

「…Y-yeah」

「That’s why I want you to show the real you to me since we’re only in a temporary relationship, Lupetta. You’re only going to be wild when you’re in this mansion. Once you leave this place, you’re back to the Lupetta who will always love Mergin」

「……Unn」

I repeated the same thing over and over and continued to imprint the idea in her mind.

「Let’s make one more promise. I want to see you being honest. If you promise me that, I will definitely keep it a secret. This relationship we have is only in this mansion. You only have to be honest when you’re in here. All our secrets will be kept safe with that. In this mansion, there won’t be a Lupetta who’s like the one in front of Mergin, only a slightly naughty Lupetta who is honest. Okay?」

「……I understand」

「Good girl」

I lightly hugged Lupetta and kissed her forehead while her face slightly turned red.

We made a promise that only I would gain something out of it, but she didn’t seem to mind. Maybe her brain wasn’t working, or she felt bad for peeing the bed, or she was actually seeking pleasure deep down inside.

I intended to give her the excuse to be guilt-free for going wild in this villa. I will let her know that many times from now on and imprint it into her heart.

After I returned to my seat, we continued our meal.

Perhaps it’s because we have drawn the line on our relationship inside this mansion, Lupetta’s expression has brightened up a bit. 

After that, I heard about how she grew up, how she met Mergin, and the hardships adventurers go through. Sometimes she would also ask me about the city of Nyuneri and I would answer her.

But 60% of our conversation was just her usual ranting. She might see me as someone who would listen to her whine no matter how much she does it.

It was adorable when she tried so hard to casually make me promise her that I will never ejaculate inside of her vagina.

Of course, I rejected it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 62: A Talk About The Royal Capital
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Until the day Lupetta goes into the field, she was scheduled to come here every afternoon to sleep with me.

I’m fucking her while I can so that I won’t regret it in the unlikely scenario that she dies in the field.

Just to be safe, I taught her things like the support policies we have for adventurers in our territory as well. Me, being the kind person that I am, had also decided to prepare a parting gift for her later. It would be a shame if she dies.

After our meal ended, Lupetta returned to the inn. The sun had already completely set and the city was enveloped in darkness by that time. 

Since she had not been released from the magic seal that was put on her during the time of interrogation, she was no different than a normal girl who has no magic power. I decided to send someone to guard her until she gets to the inn. 

As for me who remained in the villa, I was wondering whether I should return to the castle or stay here.

I busted a nut once in the morning with Minith, and I busted a nut once with Lupetta in the evening. It’s already night time now, but I still want to do it two more times.

That’s why I was eagerly waiting for Eve’s return…with an eager penis.

「Um…it started…since noon today. Um…I deeply apologize…」

Right when I was wondering what kind of “play” to do with her, Eve told me that as she bowed her head deeply after she came back from her job at the innovation association.

It seems that her period has come. Unbelievable. I want to check if it’s true, but she would definitely hate me even more if I began checking her pussy for that. Let’s just leave it at that.

「Don’t worry about it since it’s not something you can help. I’ll give you tons of love when that’s over, okay?」

I hugged her and ran my tongue around inside of her mouth with a deep kiss.

Since there’s no meaning for me to remain here if I can’t have sex with her, I decided to return to the castle.

Still, this timing is horrible. I have only had sex with her once after I returned to Nyuneri, didn’t I? What is a sex slave even for?  

「Young master. Master seems to want to have a talk with you, what would you like to do?」

When I called Tesh to inform him that I want to return to the castle, he opened her mouth and reported that to me first.

I have no idea what this is about, but if it’s my father who wants to speak to me, I should probably go see him right away.

「I see. I was just thinking about returning to the castle, so this is perfect. Tesh, go get ready」 

「Understood」

After I returned to the castle, I was called to the innermost room. 

That innermost room is a rarely used room that he uses when he doesn’t want to worry about anything getting leaked out. 

The last time I went in there was the time father instructed me to learn more about women. What a nostalgic room. I was still a child at that time.

「Wilk. I’m sorry to call you in the middle of your studies」

「No, I had just finished so it’s alright」

My father apologized to me with a grin on his face; perhaps he thought that he had called me back in the middle of sex. Since there was only me and him in this room, it felt kinda relaxing. 

I stood in front of my father’s desk and waited for him to start the talk.

「The reason I went through all that trouble to call you here…is because of this, Wilk」

Father put a wooden board on his desk and moved it towards me to show it to me.

「This is…」

This is the wooden board I handed to Tesh this afternoon. It had the name of Miss busty from the Synod church and the location of the convent written on it.

I was going to take down this Miss busty with my cock, but even though she was a commoner, she belonged to the Synod, so I had Tesh ask my father for his confirmation on this just in case. 

「About your question, Wilk」

「…Is it bad if I were to put my hands on her?」

When the moment comes, I was going to find her weakness from the Synod’s side and blackmail her, but for father to go through all this trouble to call me back here, that might not be a good idea to do.

「Now’s no good. The timing is bad」

After he said that, he took out a letter from his desk and put it next to the wooden board. Then, he looked at me as he tapped his finger on the letter.

「It’s a letter from Melly. A plan to crackdown the Synod was written in the letter」

Melly is my mother’s name. She’s currently staying at a mansion in the royal capital and gathering intelligence as she socializes with nobles from other territories.

Without actually handing me the letter to have me read it, father then got right to the point.

「The Synod seems to be plotting something in the Levios kingdom. The letter stated that the royal capital had noticed some Synod believers participating in suspicious activities and had placed them into custody. We don’t know what they are after, but there’s no doubt that it’s connected to St.Navenpos」 

The Levios kingdom is an anti-Synod country, but no one is going to go out of their way to find out about the citizen’s beliefs to smoke out the Synod believers. The country would not particularly get mad over their citizens reading the Synod’s scripture and believing in their teachings.

It only becomes a problem when a Synod church is built and they start to run as an organization with priests and stuff.

There was a catchphrase back when the country was founded. 『Destroy churches on sight, kill priests on sight and correct the believers on sight』. The important part of that phrase is the part about destroying the churches and killing the priests. That, in other words, is aimed at destroying the gathering places for the Synod believers, their connection with each other, and their system of command. 

Most commoners were Synod believers at the time, so they couldn’t just kill them all. If they did that, the country would just end up as a piece of dead land. Since it was impossible to make the people abandon the faith they had their whole life, they are considered “corrected” if they just leave the organization known as the Synod.

Because of that, Synod believers still remained in the Levios kingdom. Of course, there’s neither churches nor priests, and any contact with the main quarter of the Synod located in St.Navenpos is absolutely not allowed.

Due to historical reasons and my father’s way of thinking, not only did the Synod church in our territory remain, the priests did as well. However, they are under constant, strict monitoring by the army, and they will be executed immediately if they do anything fishy. 

「It’s confirmed that the royal capital will be catching any suspicious Synod believers and executing them. Then after that, there’s a high chance that the armies of every region in this kingdom will group together under the royal army of the Levios kingdom and invade St.Navenpos」

My condolences to all the Synod believers in the royal capital and St.Navenpos.

「That’s so drastic」

「It’s exactly because of the times we’re in, there’s probably a need for the royal family to show everyone, inside or outside, their leadership. In any case, the royal capital will get hectic from now on. That’s why I’m having Melly come back to Nyuneri early」

After he said that, father put the letter back into his desk.

「It’s not a good time right now. If we get involved with the Synod carelessly, I don’t know what the royal capital and the nobles from the east will say about that. It’s bad enough that we have a Synod church so don’t get involved with them. I don’t want to give those people any openings. Do you understand me?」

「Yes, father」

We, the Qualdense, are nobles in the western part of the Levios kingdom. We don’t have a good relationship with the nobles in the east.

It would be bad if things get fucked up because of my sex drive. I should behave here.

「Once the crackdown of the Synod believers starts in the royal capital, we will probably follow suit in consideration of the royal family…At that time, do as you like」

It’s going to be good once I can start throwing false charges out when the crackdown begins. That’s my father alright~ he understands me well!

I looked at my father with a big smile on my face and thanked him.

Chapter 63: Father and Son
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have put Miss busty from the Synod church on hold for now.

I don’t know when the crackdown on the Synod will start, but judging from what my father told me, it shouldn’t be that long until then. I will wait while looking forward to that time.

「I hid my identity yesterday and went into the Synod church. Is that okay?」

Father had allowed me to visit the Synod church If I disguised myself as a commoner.

However, since I got his permission to do that from a pretty long time ago, it might be bad that I did that in the current situation. That being said, I just found out about all that now so even if he complains, it’s not like there’s anything I could have done. 

「The Synod believers were captured in the royal capital just the other day. Melly had immediately sent me that letter which arrived just last night via a messenger on horseback after she learned of it. The priests of that church were probably not on guard when you paid your visit yesterday because they didn’t know about that information yet. Everything should be okay 」

Technologies for long-distance communication such as phones or radio communications still do not exist on this continent. In the current methods used to transmit information, delivering letters by horses, by birds, or by things such as dragons were the quickest methods.

「However, you must not approach them anymore. There’s a high chance that they will capture you to get information out of you. It’ll bring us trouble at the time of the crackdown if you are careless. Even if you were to sneak in with a commoner’s disguise, one of the priests in the Synod church of Nyuneri should have magic power…Yeah, I know you’re after that priest this time Wilk, but any disguise would be meaningless if they could use magic detection. While it’s hard to imagine commoners could use the detection spell even if they have magic power, this is just to be safe. Never get close to them, Wilk」

「I understand」

Since the spell to detect magic power consumes quite a large amount of magic power, people cannot use it unless they possess magic power of the noble-class. I could do this easily and activate it at will because of the magic training I have been doing from a young age after I was reincarnated, but if a person with a commoner’s magic power level tries, they will run out of gas instantly. 

Unlike nobles, most commoners do not possess magic power at all, so the chance of them being able to activate that spell is also very low in the first place.

There are also spells that could let someone set up magic power detection in a limited area for much less mana, but only educated noble guards would know how to use something like that.

After hearing my response, father relaxed and exhaled as if letting me know that the talk was over.

「That’s all」

With that, he put his hand out and motioned me to go sit down on the sofa. It’s a sign that he wants to have a talk with me not as one of the lords, but as my father.

After I sat down at the sofa, he took out two goblets and a bottle of alcohol and placed them on the short-legged table in front of me. Since this room had no servants, father had to do all of that by himself. 

「I have received some good alcohol. Go ahead, drink up」

「Thank you」

Father poured us each a cup and we had a toast.

When I took a look inside the goblet, a rich and sweet scent drifted to my nose. In the Levios kingdom and the Jinkaen Empire, sweet alcohol is considered high-end.

When I gulped down a cup and lightly moistened my throat, a sweet flavor similar to the taste of watermelon filled my mouth. This drink didn’t seem to have a high alcohol percentage.

「It’s a gift from the royal capital」

「It’s refreshingly delicious」

Then for a while after that, we chatted as we drank.

We talked about the alcohol, the capital, my mother returning, Nambonan city, father’s first war campaign, Fanny who became spoiled, and new merchandise from the innovation association. We talked about basically anything.

Then, when we almost finished all the alcohol, father looked at me with his silver eyes and made a fist with his left hand.

「The slave, the maid, the tavern owner’s daughter. The merchant’s daughter and the villager girl. Oh, I can’t even count them all with my fingers, huh?」

He counted them one by one with his fingers as he listed them until his left hand completely unfolded.

「The adventurer, and then this time it’s a priest from the Synod church. You have already surpassed me…」

He held 7 fingers out towards me, five from his left hand and two from his right.

It feels a bit weird when my father has a complete understanding of how many women I fucked. And I’m not sure how I should react to this. Should I go like “Guhehe! But I ain’t done yet!”?

「Is that so?」

「Yeahh. I’m a man who can’t love more than a few women like many others. I’m a bit jealous of you and my broth- I mean, your uncle, who can just sleep with any random women」

I thought that sounded a bit mean, but my father seemed genuinely happy for me with that smile on his face.

I have heard about this before as well. While there are many noblemen with strong sex drives, not many of them would put their hands on various different women.

Most noblemen only ejaculates in the woman they like. But in this case, the will of the woman they like would be irrelevant once the noble set his eyes on the woman. Whether it’s consensual or not, he will keep on fucking her. Both parties will be happy if it’s the former, but if it’s the latter, things would be a tragedy.

「Back when your father was your age, Wilk, I was always told that “It’s not good to sleep with the same woman, learn from your brother”. But in the end, I couldn’t do much in bed. It bothered me even when I tried to think like that brother of mine」

Hahaha, my father laughed as he drank another glass of alcohol. This man, he actually likes to have sex talks, doesn’t he?

According to him, there are many noblemen who are just like him. They won’t be able to finish even if they could get it up unless it’s with the women they truly like.

Although I get hard and want to cum in them immediately when I see any beautiful women.

「I was relieved when I learned that you are like my brother, Wilk. Teaching a child about women is a lot of work after all」

Generally speaking, noblemen are sexually sensitive people.

If their first time was a failure, they will become scared in bed. In some cases, they end up not able to do anything at all to their wife when that time comes. On the other hand, they could also end up completely reliant on the woman of their first time if it went well and not look at any other women or their own wife. 

First, get good at sleeping with one woman, then it would be perfect if one could move to another one or two more. It’s important to get rid of the sense of resistance when it comes to sleeping with multiple women. 

After I slept with Eve and lost my virginity, I went to sleep with Minith the next day or the day after that without anyone telling me to. It seems that not only my father, but our servants were so happy that they did a standing ovation somewhere I didn’t even know about.

「…Sleeping with two women is something that has to be generally pushed by the father or a close aide. When you wanted to sleep with your personal maid, Tesh and Leydi probably felt like a weight was lifted off their shoulders too」

For some reason, I feel like I became a crested ibis. Tesh and the head maid are like my zookeepers.

「You’ll be able to greet your wife with confidence if you keep on learning like that. Just for reference, would you tell me what kind of women you like?」

「The kind of women I like?」

Nobles often have political marriages. However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t marriages out of love. I know about that very well.

「In the situation where there’s more than one marriage candidate, you would want a girl you like too, right? 」

「Well, yeah」

It would be nice to meet each other in person before the marriage, but it’s quite possible for the marriage to be decided without us even knowing about what each other looks like.

Since It’ll be up to my father at that time, I think it’s important that I let him know the type of woman that I like.

「I would be happy if she’s beautiful and has a nice personality」

I was really thinking about it even though I gave that really broad answer.

But unlike in Japan where I could use celebrities as an example for the type of women I like, I couldn’t really put it into words here.

「Even if you tell me beautiful…Try naming me someone I know that you consider beautiful」

「Someone that you know, huh…?」

「Hm, then would it be better if I were to name some people out? …What about…someone like Plume Silopea?」

Since Plume is my mother’s sister’s daughter, she’s a beauty. To be more precise, she’s the type I’m quite fond of. There is no problem with her personality either so I’d rather marry her if someone terrible is going to get chosen. 

「She’s a beauty I can’t complain about. I would be happy to marry her」

「Hm」

After that, father listed some other girls’ names and asked me if I thought they were pretty.

The noble daughters near us, father’s personal maids, and he even asked me about Fanny in the end. I feel like we had a long talk. 

「…I see. I’ll remember your preference, Wilk」

「Thank you」

Father put his empty goblet on the desk. *Kan*, the wooden sound echoed in the room.

「…In the past, my father asked me my preference on girls as well. As a result, I got married to Melly. I’m still glad that I told him my true feelings that day」

Father and mother got married without knowing what each other looked like, but they get along very well. Mother’s appearance seems to line up perfectly with my father’s preferences. 

When my grandfather decided on his marriage partner, he seemed to have given him the choice of mother or mother’s sister. Mother’s family recommended their younger daughter, which was mother’s sister, but grandfather selected mother after he heard father’s preference.

「I want to select one that fits the best with what you want in your future wife as well, Wilk. I had to get married in a hurry back then so there wasn’t time for me to choose, but now we can probably have you do face to face meetings」

「That would be great」

After he nodded to my response, father opened his mouth again with a dry smile. For some reason, I feel like this was what he wanted to tell me the most.

「…If there’s a “Fifth Region Princess” for you too then please let me know」

「Yes father. There isn’t anyone like that as of now」

Since the marriage between grandpa and my late grandma was a rare marriage of love between nobles, their love story was sung by the bards, put together into a book, and turned into plays. There’s a pretty sizable theatre in the city of Nyuneri, and the play about them called『The Crimson Demon and the Fifth Region Princess』 is occasionally performed there. 

The first time I saw that play, I never realized that it was modeled after my grandparents at all. The man in the play who tossed away everything for love never reminded me of my grandpa.

Father was probably telling me to consult them if I fell in love with any noble’s daughter because my grandfather is quite capable of cheering me up if things go wrong.

I put my emptied out goblet on the desk and smiled at my father.

For the next few days after that, I lived the days peacefully while making preparations for the departure to Nambonan.

I would do it with Minith a few times throughout the morning, then a few times with Lupetta in the afternoon. It was a wonderful sex life. I would have liked to sleep with Eve once before I went to bed, but sadly, she was on her period.

Then, today is the day Lupetta departs for the field near the city of Nyuneri.

After I called her to the villa in the morning, I hugged her as soon as she entered the room. We did not have sex because she was going to depart soon after. We simply cuddled.

「Lupetta. Take good care of yourself, okay?」

「…It’s my first time entering that field, I’ll be careful even without you telling me that」

「I see. I’ll make you feel good again after you come back. Make sure you come back alive, okay?」

「……Uu……」

Her face turned red and she looked away. Taking advantage of that, I snuck a kiss to her forehead.

After we made the promise the other day, she started to become louder in bed and she started to tell me where it feels good for her. Progress with her has been steady.

Losing her now would do quite a lot of damage to me. Because of that, I had personally gone through the trouble of preparing a parting gift for her and gave it to her in person. It might be helpful to her somehow.

「Alright, since you guys already got your magic seals undone, try to meet up outside of the city, okay?」

「Yeah, I know」

If her gang of adventurers meet up inside the city, her group of six commoners with magic power will end up being taken to the guards again.

Since they aren’t that stupid after all, they seem to be meeting up outside of the city.

After I sent Lupetta off, I went into my own room in the villa. I don’t come into this room very often since I normally go straight to the bedroom.

「Young master. Your plans after this?」

「Hm. I think…I’ll go check out how the association is doing and then return to the castle afterwards」

When I answered Tesh’s question, I noticed there was something on the desk.

「Is something the matter?」

「No, but there’s some silver coins here? What is this about?」

There were some silver coins wrapped in a cloth on the desk instead of inside the drawer.

「…Ahh, those are the silver coins from the other day」

I had a date with Minith at the castle town the other day. Those silver coins were prepared for that date. Since using kiris gold coins in the city’s marketplace would have made us stand out like a sore thumb.  

Even though those silver coins were prepared, they were never used up on the date, so they just stayed in my pocket.

Then because I took Minith to the villa and took off my clothes like that, a servant probably placed the silver coins that were in the pockets here. I don’t know who did it, but if they aren’t attentive enough to take a hint and return them to the castle, I think they will be warned by Tesh. Somehow, I feel like Tesh had a sharp gaze.

「I see. So it’s mine, then…Anyway, I will go to the association. Please make the preparations for it」

「Understood」

After I put the silver coins into my pocket, I left the villa.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 64: Enjoying the Widowed Employee Who Has Children (Part ½)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Silver coins were being counted as sounds of metal clanging echoed in the president’s office of the innovation association. 

Since I don’t normally need to use money in stores, carrying silver coins would just get in the way. The only time I get to use money is when I’m on a stealth tour.

The reason I went through all the trouble to bring the silver coins that were left in the villa here was because there was one with a design that I had never seen before mixed in there.

The innovation association often carries out commercial activities and many of our employees are familiar with each country’s currency. I wanted to show them the coin and find out which country it came from.

After several employees examined the coin, it turns out that it was a coin that was made to commemorate the foundation of the Jinkaen Empire. Since it was made over 50 years ago, it appears to be a super rare coin that is no longer in circulation.

The coin probably got carelessly mixed in because it looks like a normal silver coin of the Levios kingdom at a glance.

The Levios Kingdom occasionally changes the design and the percentage of gold in their gold coins so there are all kinds of different gold coins. When someone says gold coin, they’re generally talking about kiris gold coins, but there are a few more types.

However, there has only been one type of silver coin since the founding of the country 80 years ago. For that reason, silver coins are just called silver coins or royal silver coins.

The size and the thickness of the commemorative silver coin that got mixed in was the same size as the royal silver coins. If you look at the portrait of the first generation Jinkaen emperor on the coin or the design that’s on the back of it, one could easily tell them apart. But if they are bundled up with the royal silver coins then it’s very easy to miss it.

I took a closer look at the back of the coin, but I couldn’t really tell what was drawn on there. The left side of the coin’s picture resembled a human, the center resembled the sun, and the right is probably a dragon or a snake or a centipede or earthworm.

I couldn’t really tell because the technology used to craft the coin was too low, the coin itself is too small, and the design was oversimplified. 

In any case, since it turned out to be a rare coin, I decided to keep it in my collection room in the castle. I might learn something if I ask father and grandfather about it later.

Let’s give the rest of the royal silver coins to Tesh for him to return them to the treasury.

My door was knocked on in a slightly faster rhythm than how my servants would knock. This is the knock of an employee. 

「Excuse me, president. May we enter?」

「What is it?」

After the two employees came in and greeted me, they showed me some wooden boards.

One of the employees is a management level employee, a middle-aged man. The other one is a normal female employee who walked in unsteadily as she had a chest full of wooden boards. 

I remember this woman. The wooden nameplate by her chest said “Mimon”.

A few years ago, when I wanted to hire people for the innovation association, I did employment tests similar to how it was done in Japan from my past life. I decided to hire anyone who looks like they’ll work seriously regardless of their gender.  

After picking out people who could read, write, and do calculations at the bare minimum level, I interviewed them.

This Mimon girl made an impression on me during the interview. This vulnerable-looking beauty in her mid-twenties who had a sad aura around her begged me to hire her with tears in her eyes.

When I saw her beg me in desperation like that, I decided to hire her so that I could do erotic things with her at a later time. After that, I heard that women in the city rarely work for organizations they have absolutely no connections with. They generally either work for their family business, get introduced to a job through connections, or take care of their house.

Mimon had lost her husband in an accident and became a widow. She seems to have children to support too so she applied for a job here at the innovation association because we paid slightly higher than other places.  

The middle-aged man in the management position slid his finger onto a wooden board.

「Regarding the wholesale of silk, the number of inquiries from the trading companies of Nambonan city has increased. What would you like to do? Considering our production volume at the moment…..」

Apparently, Nambonan merchants are eager to enter deals with Nyuneri’s trading companies to take advantage of the fact that Nambonan has become part of our territory.

Especially with the innovation association since we are the manufacturer of silk, the Nambonan merchants seem to want to make deals with us at all costs. 

Up until now they could only get Nyuneri silk indirectly, so they probably came to the conclusion that they would be able to make huge profits if they could enter a direct contract with us.

It looks like my employees already have all kinds of things planned out between one another, so all they have to do is to explain all the plans to me, the highest person in charge, and get the decision from me.

I asked them some questions I had in mind, then got everyone on the same page for our future plans.

「*Sighhh*, I really want to drink some tea」

「I will go make some」

Mimon, who had been standing next to me with wooden boards, gracefully walked out of the room.

I wonder if she’s going to be 30 soon. Her relaxed atmosphere combined with the unique air around her somehow got me wondering.

「…Proceed as such. I’ll let her know when she gets back here, so you can go back to work」

「Yes sir. Please excuse me」

The middle-aged man in the managerial position took the large amount of wooden boards with him and left my office.

Having a female employee make tea for you feels like a scene out of the Showa era of Japan in my past life, it’s nice. It might be a good idea to introduce uniforms in the association like in Nyuneri’s castle. I want to try making female employees here wear office lady clothes. I want to have an office affair.

「Sir, here is your tea」

「Thanks」

Mimon came in with a cup of tea on a tray.

I hired her back then at the interview since she is a beauty, but it seems that she has been doing her job diligently all these years. My judgment was correct.

I scanned through her entire body again.

She was wearing normal clothes that commoners wore. Since her top and her skirt were both gray, they felt plain.

Although her expression looked a bit gloomy, she had the face of a refined lady. To put it simply, she is a beauty.

As a woman, she has a decent sized chest and a delicious huge butt that seems like it would be fun to stroke. When I saw her ass sway as she walked, it felt like it was telling me to do it.

As she placed the tea on my super luxurious president’s desk, I got closer to her.

「*Hiiii*…?!」

When she came to realize it, I was already massaging her butt. I could feel the softness of her mature butt through the cloth.

Without paying mind to how she froze up in shock, I continued to repeatedly stroke her butt. It’s so fluffy and soft.  

「You have a nice ass」

「Please don’t do that, president…」

She caught the wrist of my right hand that was drunk on the feel of her butt and tried to disrupt my movements. However, I have no intention of stopping.

Since I’ve already come this far, I’m not going to give up here.

「There’s no need to be shy」

I shook free from her hand and started massaging her butt again.

Unlike the firm and nicely shaped butt of Minith and Eve or the tight, well-toned butt of Lupetta, it has a thicccness and softness that the butts of young girls do not have. It kind of reminds me of Anna’s.

「Please stop it. I beg you…Please…」

Unfortunately for her, that unpleasant expression only stimulated my crotch. Whether it tickled my desire to protect or my sadistic desires, just from seeing that face alone put my cock in battle mode.

I normally ejaculate with Minith throughout the morning, but I haven’t shot anything out today since I was seeing Lupetta off. I feel like I have quite a bit built up.

「It’s such a nice and soft ass」

「President…We can’t…」

This time I used both of my hands to grab her butt. She has so much ass that it seems like there’d be more than enough ass to sandwich my dick firmly even if I were to do her from behind.

「Why not? It’s not like I’m doing this to you for free」

「……Ahhh……」

Mimon stopped moving as if something came to her mind.

She seemed to have given up on resisting since she couldn’t say no to my sexual harassment because I’m the president of the association.

I raised my index finger and poked her butt. It was so soft it felt like it was sucking my finger in.

「Put your hands on the desk」

「…Yes sir」

I stood up from my chair and put one hand on her shoulder. Then, I used the other hand to loosen the belt that binds her thin waist. It’s amazing that she can have such a big ass with a waist so slim that it seems like it would just snap if I kicked it.

「Huh…?!」

Since she probably understands what I want to do to her from the butt rubbing, she was fidgeting around as if she didn’t want it. I can only see that as her tempting me.

「Please don’t do it…! We mustn’t…Ahhh…!」

After I took off her skirt and lowered her underwear, there was the ripe pot of honey.

The angle and the hardness of my cock soared as the rich female scent invited me.

Her female genitals that were closely packed with pubic hair were irresistible. From the looks of it, it looks like she did not remarry.

「President…! I beg you, please spare me…!」

I slid my fingers into the dry forest.

While I teased the area around her clitoris, I caressed her butt so hard that she could feel it in her rectum.

After caressing her for a while, she started to become a bit wet.

「When was the last time you slept with a man?」

「…Please no」

As a punishment for not answering my question, I wet my middle finger with my saliva and stuck it in her bum.

Her painful voice echoed in the room, then I pulled my finger out and wiped it on her skirt on the desk. I was excited but I did not go crazy enough to lick my finger.

「…A-after my husband died, I…Please, stop. I have children too…Please…」

I don’t know how long ago her husband died, but it should be quite a long time. There might be spider webs inside her.

After I asked her about it, it appears that she has four children with the oldest one being 11 years old. Since she gave birth to her first child at 17 years old, that means she’s 28 right now.

「You can return to being a woman after you’ve been a mother for so long. I’ll give you some love」

「Ahhh…Nooo…」

When I teased her vagina with my fingers, love juice started to ooze out of there with watery noises.

She probably never thought that she would be violated by a man who could pass as her son. It’s so much fun because it feels like I’m sexually harassing a junior of the company instead of a mother. However, I feel unsatisfied doing this until I put it in her.

While taking in the scent of her love juice that makes me light-headed with excitement, I took everything below my waist off.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 65: Enjoying the Widowed Employee Who Has Children (Part 2/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fluffy feeling of her pubic hair has disappeared after she became soaking wet with love juice.

The womb that had given birth to four children is deep inside this vagina. Perhaps it had noticed a chance to obtain new seeds; the vaginal opening was giving forth a female’s scent while it gaped open and shut as it sought for a male genital and its seeds.

「I’m going to put it in from behind like this. Okay?」

「President…Please…spare me…」

Mimon said something with her hands on the president’s desk and her ass sticking out, but it’s not possible for me to stop now.

「What are you saying when you’re this wet? You’re probably hoping for it, right? What a dirty woman. I can’t believe you’re craving the cock of a guy who is young enough to be your son」

「Y-you’re wrong」

I put my erect cock between Mimon’s asscheeks and hugged her from behind. Then, I slid my hands into her clothes to massage her raw breasts.

「These are some nice titties」

Her breasts weren’t that firm, but they’re a nice pair of soft breasts that feel like they melt in my hands.

I could really feel the warmth of her body from her slightly sweaty skin.

Although I know her nipples aren’t erect yet judging from the stiffness, I’m familiar with how they worked, so I used my palm to stimulate those tits. It’s not visible from outside, but I noticed that her nipples are kind of on the large side as I touched them.

I used my fingers to draw circles around the area that seems to be her areola to send a signal to her nipples that marks the start of our sexual intercourse.

 「Hnnnn..Please…Stop it」

While I continued to rub one of her nipples that easily became hard with the pulp of my finger, I inserted my cock into her vagina.

It felt very warm as my cock pushed through her vagina that took my cock in without resisting.

As expected, a woman that has given birth has a completely different feeling than the women I normally sleep with. While I thought it was a bit unsatisfying fucking a pussy that was used to taking in another man’s cock, it felt very comfortable and peaceful.

「Oooh…I’m wrapped in your pussy…」

「AHHH…! N-no! ……I’m so sorry…dear…」

She tilted her head back and started to mumble out the name of a man that I did not know. That was probably the name of her late husband.

It won’t do anything even if she remains faithful to a man that is no longer in this world. I want her to help me out when I get hard in the future.

「Even though you’re saying that, your body is more honest. It’s happily welcoming my thing in」

After I said what a perverted old man who is sexually harassing her would say, her vagina slightly tightened on my cock.

「That’s not true…」

However, her vagina that had already taken my whole cock in there was hot and wriggling. My cock was being guided to the bottom of the ocean of pleasure as her shuddering vaginal walls gently enveloped it.

It was nothing like a young woman’s vagina that squeezes on my cock tightly for semen.

Mimon’s vagina definitely knows that it gets semen from the guy by making them cum. That’s why it doesn’t just squeeze me forcefully. Instead, it contracts over and over again to tease me. Did it learn how to do that from her late husband? 

「Whatever, I’m going to start moving now」

「*Hiiii*」

When I started to move my cock, sounds of air leaking out of her vagina could be heard with every thrust.

「Mnnn…Mnnnnn…Mmmmm…haaa…Mmmn…Mmmm……!」

「That’s good」

Mimon’s voice leaked out as she endured my thrusts. Did she just want me to hurry and end this? She doesn’t look like she’s really into it.

I feel like I can simply ejaculate as it is. That’s how good this ripe pot of honey of hers feels.

For the time being, I decided to shoot the one shot out that had accumulated since this morning.

「I’m cumming. I’m letting it out inside」

「Ehh…?! Please forgive me! It’s a dangerous period for me……」

「Ugh, I’m cumming!」

With a big thrust into her huge ass, Spurrtt! Semen was released. 

As semen continued to spurt out inside of her, Mimon’s vagina started to squeeze my entire cock tightly. I could feel her vagina swallowing my semen.

「Mnn! …Ahh, I came. How’d you like that?」

「Ahhhhhhh……」

Just thinking about her well-experienced womb taking in my semen alone makes me feel like I could go for another round.  

I kissed her neck after she ended up laying down on the desk, then I pulled my cock back out.

「I’ll make love to you on the sofa next」

Maybe she knows that she cannot go against my orders; she started to silently move to the sofa with white liquid dripping down her thighs. Ahh, what a waste. 

I laid her down on the sofa, and then I tore off her entire top and stripped her naked.

「Hohooo. To think you’ve already raised four kids with these delicious-looking titties」

The size of her breasts is probably bigger than the average female. I feel like they aren’t as firm as the ones from younger women and they were hanging to the sides though.

But it’s a fact that this plain and sloppy pair of breasts has captivated my heart.

And most of all, those nipples. Two round, marble-like nipples could be seen on her areolas that were in the color of dark tea.

I could feel an element of excitement that is not found on beautiful, light-colored nipples. These are the type of nipples that make me want to vulgarly suck on them. 

「I’m going to have a taste of this. …*Mnchuu*」

I sucked on one of her nipples and savored it by rolling my tongue all around it.

Breast milk might still be coming out of these if it were a few years ago. I felt very disappointed when that thought crossed my mind.

「President, please…let me take care of what had just happened first…」

「Mnn *chuuu*…*chuuuu*. *haaa*…You mean birth control? No, that is not allowed」

「But…」

I put my mouth back on her breast again. I shifted my body weight onto Mimon just like that.

Since she was taller than me, my body ended up being completely on top of hers.

The feeling of wanting to fawn on her more surged up in me, so I continued to suck on her breast without thinking about anything else.

「Please…stop…If I end up with a child…」

My withered dick revitalized fully from her words about her having my child.

「Mm, it’s back already. We’re going to go for another round, okay?」

「Uaaa……」

I got up from her and got into the missionary position. 

Then, I started to insert my cock into her vagina that already had semen spilling out.

「Mm, it’s easy to get in there since it’s the second round. *Pant*, I’ll give you some more of my seeds soon」

「Why are you doing this…this is so cruel…」

「It’s a waste to do nothing when you have a body that nice, don’t you think? Your thing down there is happy, you know?」

*Thrust*, my cock went into the deepest part of her in one go. The semen that was already in there gushed out and scattered onto the sofa.

「*Haaa*…Nnm…Mnn…」

「Hey, open your mouth. I’m going to kiss you」

Our lips touched as I continued to move my hips. Then, I pushed my tongue in her mouth.

Sticky saliva then stuck onto my tongue.

「Mmmm…?! S-stop…*Chuuuu*…*chuuu*…*chuu*…*Puwaa*!」

I chased her mouth down over and over as she tried to escape my kisses and exchanged our saliva while I continued to thrust.

After I enjoyed the feeling of hitting her womb with my cock for some time, I felt like my second climax was about to come.

「Ugh, here, here’s another shot. Take it in nicely!」

「Please no, no no no no no !」

It didn’t have the same momentum as the first time, but semen flew out inside of her with considerable force still.

When I shoved it in as deep as I could to perfectly match my semen shooting out, it felt like I was shooting directly into her womb. 

「AHHHH…This…Wha…What am I going to…」

Although Mimon wasn’t crying, she was mumbling to herself with a face of despair.

Until I finished letting out everything inside of her, I hugged her head the entire time. I could still go for another round if I wanted to, but I was satisfied enough for now.

With our genitals still connected, I deliberately let Mimon see me put my hand into my outer garment’s pocket, and then I took out the silver coins.

Since I have no use for these until I go on the next stealth tour, I’ll just get rid of them here.

「That was good, Mimon. Here, take these」

「……Okay」

She honestly accepted the silver coins without saying anything else.

Tesh had mentioned before that it’s recommended to use kiris gold coins when rewarding female citizens who were virgins, but silver coins are fine for the second time I sleep with them and after. Since she had already given birth, silver coins would probably be appropriate. It’s a hassle to hold on to only a few of these coins, so I decided to give her all of them.

「This much…?」

Because of the large number of silver coins I had just handed her, Mimon asked me with a slightly surprised face.

「Of course. It was really good. Just take them, there’s no need to hold back」

「Yes, president…」

「Also, about getting pregnant…I’ll take care of the child if that happens. You don’t have to worry about money」

「T-Thank you…」

After Mimon replied with a bitter smile on her face, I gave her a deep kiss once again. Then, I pulled out my cock that had become soft.

When I pointed out that semen-covered cock at her, even though she had an unpleasant expression on her face, she silently put it in her mouth and started cleaning it.

I’m thankful to her late husband since he had properly trained his wife.

Chapter 67: The Production Department
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the one-sided lovemaking with Mimon ended, I began fixing my clothes.

She cleaned up her crotch then gathered her clothes that were scattered all over the place and put them back on. She was quick at it.

「You can just go home for today. Rest assured, I won’t deduct your pay」

「…Thank you, Sir」

Mimon clumsily lowered her head. Is this color closer to a banana or a yellow paprika? I stroked her hair that had such a shade with my hand.

「If other employees say anything about you behind your back or do anything that troubles you, let me know when you sleep with me next time. I won’t let you get hurt」

I casually declared to her that we’re going to have sex in the future as well.

There are many employees in this innovation association, but there aren’t many females here. Amongst them, only Mimon and Eve could be called beauties. Since Mimon is a precious beauty of the grown-up type, I want to cherish her as I continue to sexually harass her from now on.

「Oh, and I’m going to go to do an inspection at our production department after this. Please let whoever know that I would like to have somebody come with me」

「Yes sir」

Mimon then left my office in tottering steps.

Her pitiful and disheartened figure struck my heart. Next time, it might be a good idea to call her to the villa and make love to her the entire night. 

With the middle-aged man in the management position of the innovation association guiding me, we went outside the castle town.

The soap factory, the silkworm breeding facility, and all the other kinds of manufacturing sectors of the innovation association are located near the military base. Since our production department has a lot of confidential information such as the method to make soap and our selectively bred silkworms, there is fairly strict security in place so that nothing leaks out.

The city of Nyuneri has a river that’s branched off from the big river that runs through the castle town, and there are several moats built with that river as the water source. The gate of the production department of the innovation association was on an isolated floating island that’s surrounded by a moat.

The facility was originally built for holding criminals and prisoners of war, but it was abandoned because it was deteriorating from old age. The building was big enough even with all the criminals grouped together in there. If I were to make a comparison from my past Japanese life, there’s enough room to maybe have 3 baseball games going on at the same time.

To note, the jail now had been integrated into a part of the military base and the prisoners’ quarters had become a separate facility.

「Oh if it isn’t the young master. Are you here for an inspection?」

「Yeah. Let me through」

There is only one entrance to the production department and the area is filled with soldiers of our army. That’s because the innovation association is not a private enterprise; it’s a state-run enterprise. 

Since there is a lot of confidential information here, most of the soldiers on guard here have really solid backgrounds.

「Of course. Oi, open the gate」

「Yes! Right away!」

The gate that once acted as the last line of defense that prevented the escape of prisoners now prevents the employees of the production department from escaping.

The employees of the production department are slaves. Not metaphorically, but literally slaves.

The slaves that we purchased from the slave merchants in the city are locked in here to make soap, raise silkworms, and work in my workshop. 

Since I left it to the innovation association headquarter’s slave management department to handle that, I have no idea how many slaves we have here. The only thing I know is that there aren’t any beautiful women amongst them at all. That’s because there aren’t any slave merchants in Nyuneri that specialize in dealing with sex slaves.

「I see the number of slaves has also increased 」

I said after I passed through the gate and took a look around. Then, the middle-aged man in the management position who was walking next to me responded,

「That is also a concern of mine. With our production department growing bigger, we have already started to run out of space. We tried to do all that we can, but we seem to be at a point where we’re going to end up needing more space 」

I felt that the slave population density here has gotten higher compared to the last time I came here for an inspection. Although it’s to be more efficient in mass production, it does feel like it’s gotten a bit cramped here. 

On top of all this, we used to have a farm for silkworm feed here as well, so it must have been really cramped before. The place has become a bit more roomy since we asked the farming villages to grow food for the silkworms now, but if we hadn’t done that, it would really be cramped here.

「The motivation of the slaves would probably go down if they have to work in an environment that’s too cramped. I think we’re going to need to do something about it soon」

Slavery exists in the Levios kingdom, of course, but it exists in the neighboring Jinkaen empire as well. And both of those countries’ slavery systems were hopeless to escape from.

Slaves are slaves for the entirety of their life. There was a system where one could buy themselves out of slavery in the history of my past life, but it’s impossible here.

As long as the person who purchased the slave has no intention of releasing them, the slave and any children they have will be slaves. It’s sad how helpless slaves are.

In order to keep on using such people who have no futures, I have been taking that into consideration in my own way.

Not only do we give them 3 meals a day if they properly do their job, but they are also allowed to take days off work if they become sick. If they are exemplary slaves then they could also receive treatment from soldiers who could use healing magic. On top of that, they are working in an environment that would never be attacked by bandits or wild animals.

If you take away the fact that they are unable to leave the production department area, you could call it a better life than people who are living in small rural villages outside of the city of Nyuneri.

「So which sector would you like to visit first?」

「The workshop. I have some business there today」

The middle-aged man in a management position nodded, and then we headed to the workshop section.

The workshop is my hobby space. Since it’s there for me to make the things that I want to make come true, it basically always runs on a budget deficit.

An example of why it runs on a budget deficit would be charcoal. Nyuneri has a strong tendency to use firewood for fuel, so charcoal is almost unobtainable. Since I wanted to use braziers to warm my room, I made a private shed there to make charcoal for that reason alone. It’s my hobby to invest in things whether or not it will yield returns.

When I entered the workshop, the senior employee that was working there lowered his body a bit and humbly ran to me. This old man was a slave as well.

「Sir. What brings you here today? Is it about the gunpowder? Or is it about the guns?」

「Nope, neither. I’m here because of this」

And in this workshop, guns were being produced. They are the so-called muskets.

It was a project started from my grand dream of “I’m going to violate the well brought up princesses from other countries with the power of this new weapon called the musket!”. It’s a plan that has already suffered a setback.

The reason was simple, it’s because it turns out that people with magic power wouldn’t die from being hit by something like bullets out of a musket. They wouldn’t even suffer a bone fracture.

The wars of this world revolve around humans who possess magic power. The power of guns when amassed is powerful, but it’s not enough to overcome people who possess magic power. That’s how strong people with magic powers are.

Therefore, we are continuing to make improvements to the gunpowders and guns for the time being. If we can get the guns to become powerful enough to wipe out walls of commoners, then we would have a wider range of strategies at our disposal. However, there’s still a pretty long road ahead for that. 

I handed a small object the size of a chicken’s egg to the senior employee.

「And this is?」

「There is a powder inside it. Mix it in the iron and make some arrowheads with it. There isn’t much in there, so I don’t mind if you can only make about 5. It’s a precious powder. Be careful with it」

Then, the senior craftsman opened his mouth with a puzzled look.

「Yes Sir. If that’s all you want me to do then I think I can get it done soon, but…」

He was probably worried about me complaining about the arrow’s quality. I will let him know that it’s for an experiment.

「I just want to see what happens when you make them with that powder mixed into the iron. It doesn’t matter how strong or weak they turn out」

「Understood」

The elder craftsman took the accessory from my hand and took a closer look at it.

According to him, he could possibly have it done in a day or two. Since I want to find out quickly, I asked him to start right away.

After I got done with that business, I freely took a look at the gunpowder and muskets that were in the process of being improved.

Since the soap factory was making a new soap, I decided to snatch one as a souvenir. The slightly pink-colored soap was mixed with a flower extract and flower petal chips.

After I returned to the castle of Nyuneri, I gave the soap to Fanny as a present and she was very thrilled. That’s great and all, but the flower that was mixed in this soap was actually the red flower that Minith often brought with her, the maloashina flower.

I realized that when Fanny came to my room to play at night.

The faint scent of that flower that drifted from her hair made me think of my love affairs with Minith, and my crotch ended up bulging.

I almost accidentally made a move on Fanny. That is truly a dangerous soap.

Chapter 68: Author Note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This chapter is part of the main story but the chapter is in Mergin’s perspective. (The guy Lupetta likes)

This is what happened after Lupetta departed from the city of Nyuneri to the field.

In chronological order, this chapter takes place on the same day as the last chapter.

There is going to be a sudden increase of new names, but since they’re going to sound like gibberish anyway, you can just skim through them.

  With our backs against the Erekthion mountain that dominated the north, we walked towards the world of fog, the “field”, that we could see from afar. 

  The size of a field is different per case. It can be as big as a city square, or it can be as big as a noble’s territory. I don’t know if this is true, but I heard that the so-called great land of fog that’s located in the northern part of the Elluo continent has a field that is as big as a small country.

  The field south of the city of Nyuneri where we’re heading to this time is one of the larger fields inside the Levios Kingdom. I was told that it would take about one full day to go from the northernmost part of the field to the southernmost part of the field on horseback. 

  I never rode on a horse before, but I could tell that means the field is pretty big. 

  By the time the scenery in the direction we’re walking in became all foggy, it was a bit after noon.

「Over there」

  Lupetta made a small comment.

  There is an overwhelming presence coming from the white fog that was greatly expanding before us.

  The fog of the field moves its boundary line like the tide of an ocean, but the field itself does not move anywhere.

 I have never seen an ocean myself, but my grandfather back in my hometown called the fields the white oceans. 

  I think when the fog is in full tide, that place would be just right outside of the field. There are a number of simple cabins and tents that are surrounded by fences set up there with a banner raised. It’s a military base.

  There was only a simplified pattern of their official crest on the banner, but it was easy to tell which army that banner belonged to.

  The pattern was a snake entangled around a pair of crossed lances, with a splash of water that makes me think of a big river’s torrent. I have seen that symbol many times when I was in the interrogation room. It was the crest of the house of Qualdense. 

  Lupetta raised her index finger and pointed at the banner. I don’t know where she got her information from, but it seems that other than acting as a lookout for magic beasts, that base is providing support to adventurers who’ll enter the field as well. 

「Lupetta. Are you sure this’ll be alright? We’re not going to be arrested again, right?」

After I said that, our other companions opened their mouths as well as if I baited them to do so.

「Although it’s information you obtained, Lupetta, it’s scary to be so close to the military…Mergin, it must have been awful for you too, right?」

「Yeahhh. We don’t know what’ll happen if we get arrested again. Mergin, when you got arrested, it was terrible for you too, wasn’t it?」

「They didn’t let you out at all when they were investigating you, right?」

「Yeah」

  Since we were arrested right as we entered the city of Nyuneri, we were very wary of the Qualdense army. No one knows if we’ll be released the next time we get arrested. To be honest, I didn’t want to have anything to do with them.

  I feel like if a group of 6 adventurers with magic power like us suddenly approaches their base, they will misunderstand it as an attack and arrest us. 

「I got that intel from a reliable source. It’ll be alright」

  …I wonder just who she heard it from. When I thought about it again, I started to feel quite suspicious.

  Lupetta could not be called sociable at all and she’s the type who’s shy of strangers. I can’t imagine her being able to obtain such information when she doesn’t know anybody in Nyuneri.

「…And who would that be? Is that person really trustworthy?」

  I unintentionally let my real feelings out. I was so jealous that I scared even myself.

  Just imaging Lupetta getting close to someone- a man, without me knowing is making my heart throb.

  I instantly regretted it deeply after I threw out those words that sounded like I didn’t trust her.

「……Someone from the military. He told me about that stuff when I was on my way to pick you up」

「Yeah I’m not sure about that…」

  Without even looking at me, Lupetta answered me in a voice that was filled with unhappiness.

  I’ve been together with her for a long time, so I can at least somewhat understand her emotions. It wasn’t a voice of anger, it was a voice that hated everything.

  Ah, I did it again.

  Even though I trust her more than anybody else in this world, why did I respond to her like that?

「Are you worried? I’ll go alone then. Wait for me here」

「Huh? Ah……!」

  Lupetta turned around and started to walk towards the base without even waiting for my reply.

  She did not care about the five of us who couldn’t keep up with her sudden action as she walked into the distance.

「Um, Mergin? I don’t want to go. If Lupetta says that she’ll go then can’t we just let her take care of it?」

  Diana said as she shrugged.

  I have been grouped with Lupetta since the dawn of time.

  We started out as adventurers in Duke Spiazeikes’s territory, then when we started to notice that people were starting to get drafted for the army, we relocated to the royal capital, tempted by the preferential policies they have for adventurers there.

  But the royal capital that we went through so much trouble to get to was packed with adventurers, so our income wasn’t very good. 

  We began to relocate again to Marquis Qualdense’s territory after we worked for a while and got our names out there, but on our journey here, we met Diana’s party of 4 newbie adventurers.

  The female leader and the oldest of the 4, Diana.

  Tonitol, the young man with a violent atmosphere.

  Faucon, the guy with a frivolous attitude.

  Semuks, the young man who doesn’t really stand up for himself.

  Diana and Lupetta are the same age, me and Faucon are the same age, and Semuks and Tonitol are younger.

  Diana approached us and asked if they could join us after she heard that we were going to the field of the city of Nyuneri. 

  Surprisingly, all four of them possessed magic power.

  「*Haa*……」

  I let out a small sigh without letting Diana and the others notice.

  I now regret letting her and the other three join our party at that time.

  Lupetta wasn’t good at dealing with people she didn’t know in the first place. She didn’t really want her number of companions to suddenly increase by 4.

  I forcefully persuaded her by telling her that having 4 more people with mana joining us would make us even more successful and stuff, but my real goal was something else.

  My real goal- I wanted Lupetta to look back at me.

  「You guys wait here. I can’t let Lupetta go alone」

  After the 4 of them nodded at me, I ran after Lupetta.

  When I left my home village because I hated it, I was still 7 years old.

  I was able to do that because I possess magic power, but I surprised even myself when I made it to the territory of Duke Spiazeikes that was located far away from my hometown in that same year.

  Although I did it with my own power, I was immediately in financial trouble without a family supporting me. I was only 8 years old when I arrived at the territory of Duke Spiazeikes after all. Normally, that’s the age one would start helping out with their family’s business and learn how society functions.

  It was Lupetta, who’s 2 years older than me, who guided me and took care of me when I ran into her by chance while I was trying to take advantage of the fact that I possessed magic power to make a living as an adventurer.

  The way to fight magic beasts, the way to navigate in a “field”, the way to handle weapons, the way to properly use magic, how to sell the magic stones, how to avoid military checks, how to read, and how to deal with taxes……She had taught me countless things.

  She was taller than me back then, so her back seemed big and reliable.

  I wonder when I started to see Lupetta, who was like an older sister to me, as a woman. I could only remember that seeing her smile made me flustered and I have been like that ever since. 

  As my love for her grew, I began to develop complicated feelings about her treating me like her younger brother.

  On one hand, our unchanging relationship was a relief to me, but on the other hand, the fact that she didn’t see me as a man was making me impatient.

  I wanted her to see me as a man just like how I see her as a woman.

  Even though I love Lupetta so much, it’s like the words that come out of my mouth are always contrasting what I actually want to say.  

  I remember when I was young, I had once destroyed our furniture with magic just to get my mother’s attention. I didn’t grow up at all.

  The addition of Diana’s party of 4 was a selfish act. I thought that If I accomplish more achievements as an adventurer then maybe Lupetta will notice me and see me as a reliable man…

  But as a result of that, she started to smile less; everything went the exact opposite of how I wanted it to go.

  I ran up in small steps as I caught up to Lupetta.

  I could tell from being behind her, Lupetta is very small. I passed her in height long ago.

  But I don’t think I have become a man who’s big enough for her to rely on yet.

  「Lupetta」

  「…Mergin?」

  I could see a little bit of tears in her eyes when she turned around.

  My chest felt like it was being tightened by a rope. I felt sick and nauseous.

「Ah…Lupetta…Um…」

  I have to apologize to her…But that thought disappeared in an instant.

  Her fragile, slightly shivering figure robbed me of all my thoughts…She was that beautiful. 

  I was glad that it made my mind go blank. I would have probably said something else that I don’t mean and hurt her even more if I wasn’t careful.

  It’s shocking how much I’ve gone out of control lately. I’ve been especially awful to her ever since I was released from being investigated by the Qualdense army.

  Lupetta doesn’t really like taking baths, and she doesn’t wear makeup at all. Even if I gave her a wet towel to clean herself, she would only wipe her face with it. Because of that, not many people notice her, but she is actually really pretty.

  When the usually expressionless Lupetta shows her blooming smile to only me, she is so attractive that it makes me want to hug her and push her down.

  Her beauty that only I know, her best smile that is only directed at me, those things have been pleasantly satisfying the desire to monopolize her that’s in my heart.

  But at the time I was released, Lupetta had become unbelievably beautiful.

  Her clothes that were dirtied with soil had been cleaned carefully and they looked like they were new. Her skin had been polished, and her dark blue hair that is usually clumped together with oil was flowing beautifully strand by strand with complete elegance. 

  It was as if she had become a noble’s daughter.

  Up until that point, only I knew about her good points. But after she became pretty, the men we walk by would often turn around to look at her. The feeling of her no longer being only mine and the feeling of impatience that comes from my worries about losing her were gradually burning my heart. 

  Because of my feeling of not wanting her to show other guys that side of her, I told her terrible things like it’s pointless even if she tries to be pretty, it wasn’t like her, or some even meaner things and made her sad.

  It’s pathetic how I could only handle things that way because of how weak my heart is, and on top of that, I never apologized to her.

  Lupetta did not care about the horrible comments I made about her and continued to make herself pretty since then.

I don’t know what she was doing since we lived in different inns, but she always smells good as if she had been taking baths regularly. Before I realized it, I was always looking at her as the days of me becoming nervous when our eyes met continued.

  I don’t understand why she had suddenly become conscious about being clean, but if it was because of a man, a man other than me…I, I might end up going crazy.

  To be honest, ever since she changed her appearance, I feel like I have been overwhelmed with love. I would unintentionally release my magic power in rage just from imagining some guy that isn’t really there. 

  「You’re coming with me too, Mergin?」

  Lupetta said as she wiped her face with her sleeve. I feel like her face is telling me that she doesn’t want me to ask her about the reason she’s crying.

  I just nodded in silence since I didn’t want to say something unnecessary and be hated.

  「U-unn」

  I accidentally gave a short reply to her like how a child would respond, but it made Lupetta smile.

  「It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you being so docile. That makes me happy」

  「Lupetta……」

  She could smile so brightly just from me being honest like that.

  That made me happy. I’m truly happy that she did not get fed up with me yet.

  After we walked side by side for a while, the soldiers of the base probably took notice of us so they turned their attention to us.

  As we went up the entrance of the base that was surrounded by fences all around, we managed to get close normally without having any spears pointed at us.

  「Are you adventurers? Sure don’t remember your faces…」

  「Yeah. It’s our first time here. We heard that adventurers could receive some assistance here. Would you kindly tell us where to go? We’re thinking of going into the field here from now on」

  The soldier looked at us with a convinced expression. Remembering the faces of adventurers might be one of their jobs, but I feel like he stared at Lupetta for so long.

  I knew it. Good thing I didn’t let Lupetta go alone.

  「You’ll understand if you go over there. Go ahead」

  「Got it, thank you」

  I thanked the soldier quickly and got a move on. After we went to the place the soldier told us to go to, we found an open air market there. 

  It seems that after paying a venue fee to the army, merchants had opened up a market here. There were a lot of peddlers present as well.

  Since the purchasing of magic stones in this base is a right exclusively for the merchants who the army officially approved, there seems to be a punishment of a fine if we sell magic stones to any other merchants here. A middle-aged merchant had kindly taught us that. He probably guessed that we’re new here from our unfamiliar faces.

  There are also some tents that were set up by the army here, and inside those tents, it appears that we could copy the map of the field for free and learn about the ecology of magic beasts that were often encountered inside the field.

  「Magic stones are sold for less here compared to the city」

 「Ah, you’re right」

  The magic stones that we obtain by defeating the magic beasts and dismantling their corpses is an adventurer’s main source of income. Adventurers would need to look around for merchants who would buy those magic stones at a price that’s as high as possible. Merchants would come to you if you’re famous, but back when we were nobodies, Lupetta and I had to search everywhere together for trading companies that would buy our magic stones even if it would be at just a slightly higher price.

  The purchase price for the magic stones at this base was a bit lower than the city of Nyuneri. Since the purchasing of magic stones is a monopoly here, it’s probably unnegotiable as well. However, considering the time and effort we have to put in to bring the magic stones back to the city, it might be better to sell the stones here. It’s a price that I can’t tell clearly if it’s good or bad.

  The open-air market is also selling food, but it’s only slightly more expensive here compared to the city.

  「We don’t need any food, right…?」

  「Ye…yeah. We don’t」

  Diana and the other three had been buying food to the level of it being weird.

  They said it was their first time going into a field, so they ended up buying a lot of food. We had a lack of communication due to the fact that we couldn’t move as a group together in the city of Nyuneri, so each of them had bought a large quantity of food. Thanks to that, our luggage was full of food. 

  When I tried to tell them to throw some away since they bought too much, Diana said “But to throw away food that can be eaten…! We’ll incur the divine wrath of Mozzawiene, you know? Just what do you think Goukokfojio‘s blessing is…?” and so on as she preached to me with names of spirits.

And so, we ended up carrying a mountain of food here.

  Anyway, I copied the map of the field onto a wooden board inside of one of the army’s tents. I’m really thankful for this since when we were at the royal capital, they did not provide us with any maps, so we had to either make our own or buy one from other adventurers.

  There were ex-adventurers who were employed by the army stationed inside the tent, so we were able to ask them for information about the field. On top of that, it was all free. 

  The adventurer who answered our inquiries was an adventurer who specialized in Nyuneri’s field for a long time. But one day, he got careless and got his left arm bitten off by a magic beast and retired. Right when he was worrying about how to make a living, the Qualdense army was buying information about the field so he changed his occupation just like that.

  His main task seemed to be to provide information about the field to the active adventurers and collect the most updated information from any adventurers in return on any strong magic beasts that spawned and make periodic reports on the growth of magic beasts inside the field.

  Since he was hired as a field specialist, he receives better treatment than a normal soldier in the army, and he will not get drafted for war. It’s an envious job.

  While the royal capital has policies to give preferential treatment to gather skilled adventurers, Marquis Qualdense seems to have reverse policies that develop the next generation of adventurers while giving preferential treatment to ex-adventurers.

  Due to adventurers from everywhere aiming for the royal capital, rumor has it that there’s a shortage of adventurers in every region. Marquis Qualdense might have such policies set in place to try to stop the adventurers from leaving his territory.

  「Hey, Mergin」

  *Tug*, my sleeve was pulled on. Lupetta was looking at me.

  My heart naturally started pounding just a little faster from that.

  「W-what is it?」

  「How long do you plan on staying in Nyuneri? Those four came to Nyuneri for the field, so if we leave, our party will disband, right?」

She looked up at me with her big round silver eyes. I felt like they were sucking me in.

  「Y-yeah…」

  I’m sure that Lupetta doesn’t want to be in the same party with Diana and the others any longer.

  The despicable me had unintentionally said something to Lupetta that compared her to Diana and hurt her. Lupetta has been avoiding Diana because of that. 

  Diana and the others said that their goal was to work in Nyuneri’s field, so I don’t think they are going to follow us if we go somewhere else.

  Once we leave Nyuneri, our joint party will be disbanded.

  …Then the adventurer life with just me and Lupetta will begin again. That sounds way too alluring. 

  Diana aside, Tonitol, Faucon and Semuks have all been gawking at Lupetta since she became pretty and started to try to talk to her. I want to pull her away from them soon.

  「It might be good to disband our party with Diana and the others for good this time. I think a group of 4 people who possess magic power would be able to take care of themselves after learning the basics. You said that in the past as well. People can’t just have everything taught to them. That’s why once we teach them how to navigate inside a field, I think we can return to being a party with just us two like we originally were」

  I tried to provide an appropriate sophistry. I made the party on my own accord and I’m now trying to disband it on my own accord. What a selfish man I am. But I don’t care about such small pride. Us returning to a two-person party is much more important to me. 

  「Yeahh」

  「And also, as I thought…um…going on adventures with just us two…is…yeah. It makes me happier…too…」

  I couldn’t look at Lupetta’s face during the second half of my sentence.

  It wasn’t a confession of love, it’s just that I didn’t think it feels that embarrassing just from telling her how I’m truly happy inside my heart when I’m with her.

  But even so, I’m glad I said it properly.

  「Mergin…Thank goodness. Mergin, I…I thought you hated me…」

  「I would never…」

  As I replied, I noticed that tears were running down Lupetta’s face. 

  When I thought of how much I’ve hurt her, I started to feel disgusted about myself.

  「I would never hate you.You’re…」

  You’re much more important than anyone else in this world to me.

  …But I couldn’t say it outloud.

  Even though I wanted to hug her, my hands were frozen in mid air.

  I’m such a loser.

   「Mergin?」

  「Ah, it’s-it’s nothing…Say, Lupetta. The biggest field around here is Nyuneri’s right? Even after we disband our team with Diana and the others, can’t we just stay around here for a while?」

  「Ehh……?」

  「We’ve come all the way here. We can’t do much even if we go back to the royal capital, and the dukedom of Spiazeikes is unstable, so I thought it’d be good to stay in Nyuneri and work here for a while. Since it’ll be just us two, we will be able to move together in the city as well」

  「Erm……」

  「I haven’t even walked around in the city yet. If we forget the fact that we were arrested at the beginning, I don’t think it’s a bad city at all…There’s something I want from there too」

  The city of Nyuneri has become famous in the last several years. Perhaps it’s thanks to that, the city is filled with people and it’s very lively.

  Not only is their soap the most high class soap in the continent, their silk is also something that every rich girl wants.

  Since we came all the way here, I want to buy some clothes in Nyuneri. Of course, it isn’t for me, but for Lupetta.

  When I walked around in the city by myself before, I entered a clothing store that had clothes made with Nyuneri’s silk. I checked some stuff out in there with the thought of giving Lupetta some new clothes.

  She has become pretty lately, but the clothes she is wearing are still some cheap unisex clothes.

  The only female clothing she has is a two piece dress that she rarely wears, but the dress was made of hemp and it feels worn out since she’s had it for so long. 

  Since I have some money saved up, I thought it’d be nice to invite her to go to the clothing store together and pick out a nice two piece dress for her.

  Then, if I tell her how I feel at that time…

  「Something you want?」

  I can’t tell her yet.

  It’s embarrassing and I want it to be a surprise at that time.

  「Yeah. That’s why I want us to stay in Nyuneri for a bit. What do you say, Lupetta?」

  I cracked a smile as I imagined the scene of her happily wearing the clothes I picked out for her. “It’s my first time wearing something like this. It’s like I’m some rich girl…Mergin, how do I look?” …Her shy expression as she says that will be the cutest thing ever.

  Then I will reply “You look good, Lupetta”, and hug her just like that.

  Oh no, I can’t stop myself from smiling.

  Maybe she thought that my attitude had turned weird, Lupetta had a slightly confused look on her face, but she immediately responded with a smile.

  「Unn. That’s fine with me as well」

  There isn’t a clear entrance to a field. Since it’s a place where fog just spreads endlessly, one can just enter from wherever they like. 

  However, places that people usually enter from would have a more stable ground surface that would be easier to walk on. And if something unexpected happens, it would be easier to be discovered.

  We waited in front of the fog and watched people enter as we thought about where we should go in from.

  Sometimes groups would enter while pushing their carts, and sometimes people would come back out with carts full of rock-like objects. 

  According to Lupetta, those are the people who are harvesting rock salt. A part of this field is an area filled with rock salt.

  We decided to enter at one of the spots that a group of those people exited from.

  After we advanced in the fog for a while, we could no longer see the path we came from behind us. There was only a space of pure whiteness. The world outside of the fog was no longer visible.

  We had completely entered the world of fog that’s called a “field”.

  「The fog here feels thicker than the field of the royal capital」

  「Yeah」

  Due to the white fog, we could not see very far.

  If I were to throw a rock out without using any magic power, the fog is so thick that I’m sure we won’t even be able to see where it lands.

  「So this is a field…」

  The four who entered a field for the first time were looking around everywhere, but all one could see was nothing but white fog.

  The terrain will probably change once we go in a bit deeper. Other than our field of vision being extremely limited, the current situation is not much different than how it normally goes. 

  Due to Diana’s gaze wandering everywhere, we were walking at a slow pace.

  Since there’s a higher rate of encountering magic beasts deeper into the field, there’s no point in staying so close to the entrance.

  「We’re going to go on a full trip around the field this time. Let’s hurry up guys, we don’t have all day」

 It wasn’t just me or Lupetta, this is the first time any of us have entered this field. Because of that, I decided to explore the map thoroughly and see what this field is like.

  And after we teach these four about this field, I’m going to take the chance to disband our adventurer party. 

  Some time after we began walking, the ground that was full of short grass changed into a reddish-black ground surface with small cracks that look like a grandma’s chapped hands. The terrain was being changed by the influence of the fog. 

  As we proceeded on this eerie looking land, we encountered the first magic beast.

  It was a magic beast that resembled a snail. It was about the size of 3 Lupettas, and it had a creepy appearance with its shell dyed in a blood-like red.

  We learned about this beast before in the army base. Since the monster is slow like a snail as well, we could defeat it easily by attacking with magic from afar.

  In the case of people who can’t use magic, it seems that they can just weaken it by throwing rocks at it from afar until it’s weak enough to be finished off. The magic beast is very dangerous if you approach it while it still has a lot of life because of the corrosive liquid it vigorously releases from the tip of its antennas.

  After we dismantled the magic beast, we obtained a magic stone that’s about the size of an adult’s fist. This is about right since the magic beast wasn’t a full grown adult yet.

  While we were taking a break after the dismantling, Tonitol suddenly yelled out,

  「Uwahhh?! W-what is this?!」

  「What’s wrong?!」

  After I ran over to him, he flipped his sleeve and showed me his arm.

  A dozen white worms were on it. It was as if his arm was covered in white scales.

  「Oh, it’s just some leeches」

  「Leeches?! G-get them off me! Why are there leeches when there aren’t any mountains or forests around?!」 

  「Oi, don’t force it! You’ll get all bloody!」

  I grabbed Tonitol’s arm and stopped him when he was trying to get them off in a panic.

  「Leeches get on to you when you walk inside a field. It just kind of happens」

  It’s said that the leeches might also be a type of magic beast that’s created by the fog.

  They will attach to you before you know it as you walk inside a field. Then, they will start sucking your blood.



  Since there is no pain, your entire body will be full of them if you’re not aware of it.

  I’ve also heard of a story before about an adventurer who got bound by ropes and left in the field. He was found dead the next morning from blood loss. 

  Since those leeches can get onto people through their clothes, people who enter a field for the first time will be surprised and disgusted by them.

  「You’ve been carrying your stuff in the same position the whole time, right? The leeches have an easier time getting onto your body parts that you don’t move a lot. You have to stay aware and keep moving your bodies here and there to prevent them from sticking onto you」

  「Shit, how do I get them off then…?!」

  「Try to release just a little bit of your magic power. They’ll come off right away」

  Leeches are the most annoying things inside a field, but you can deal with them easily if you possess magic power like us.

  Since they are weak against magic power, you could easily remove them by releasing some magic power since that’ll make them release their bite.

  「Ah. They came off」

  Because Tonitol is also a human who possesses magic power, naturally, he is able to release magic power. He just had to brush the leeches off with his hand after that and they easily fell off.

  「You can easily deal with leeches just by doing that. It’s not something ordinary people can do though. Also, remember that the leeches will melt and disappear once you exit the field」

  Mysteriously, the leeches cannot stay alive outside of the fields.

  After I turned around and said that to Diana and the others, Faucon and Semuks rolled up their sleeves to check for any leeches. 

  As expected, both of them seemed to have leeches on them, so they released their magic power and I helped them brush their leeches off.

  This scene felt so nostalgic. I also freaked out about leeches like them when I first entered a field. The scene of Lupetta helping me get the leeches off my back with a slightly troubled expression on her face surfaced in my mind.

  Nowadays I just constantly release a thin layer of magic power so leeches don’t get onto me. Lupetta also does the same thing. Being able to do this is essential for adventurers who are active in the fields.

  It’s because of this that adventurers with magic power could stay inside a field for a long time. Humans without magic power would have to leave the field regularly to deal with those leeches.

  「Lupetta. I’m sorry, but can you help Diana out with any leeches she might have? I can’t be looking at a woman’s bare skin」

  「Nn, got it」

  Lupetta walked to where Diana is.

  I took out the wooden board that I recorded the map on and checked our current location.

  The Qualdense army has buried iron stakes at certain locations inside the field. Those iron stakes have different symbols written on them.

  By matching the symbol on the stakes to the symbols on the map that one copies from the base, you could get a rough idea of where they are on the map. 

  Our first objective is the rock salt zone. It was because Lupetta said she wants to have rock salt with her food, but it’s also deep inside the field so it’s convenient at the same time to check out the magic beasts that are located deep inside as well. 

  After I confirmed our spot with the map and a compass, it seems that we still had a long way to go. It’s going to be night time before we get there, so let’s prepare to camp out after going a bit further.

  Since I wanted to talk to Lupetta about the plan to set up the camp, I decided to wait until she’s done helping Diana out, but it didn’t take long before she finished.

  「There weren’t that many leeches on her so it only took a second. Are you thinking about camping out, Mergin?」

  「Yeah, what do you think, Lupetta?」

  「Mm…It’s our first time here, so I think it would be better to get our base ready earlier than usual」

  「That’s what I thought too」

  Lupetta is the cautious type, so she would want to prepare for a base early since it’s our first time here. 

  Even during our first time in the field of the royal capital or other small fields, we always set up our camps early as well.

  She probably wants to do it while it’s still daytime. I also agree with that.

  Due to the fog that’s covering the sky, we couldn’t really tell the position of the sun.

  I told the four others that we’re going to set up our camp early.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 69: A Commoner’s Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If I were to talk about the situation of my lower body for the past few days, it was simple.

  I would do it with Minith after she comes to the castle in the morning, then I would call Lupetta to the villa in the afternoon. Then after I return to the castle at night, I would get in bed peacefully with Fanny and fall asleep while poking at her puffy cheeks.

  Every day was very fulfilling.

  However, since Lupetta left for the field yesterday, I lost my partner for the afternoon. I thought that wasn’t going to be the case for very long, but Eve is still on her period. 

  If I invite Minith to bed in the morning and the afternoon, her entire day will only consist of being my partner. Since I like to see her work seriously at her job as well, as I thought, I want someone else to be my partner in the afternoon.

  That’s why just like yesterday, I’m going to sexually harass Mimon a bunch in the afternoon today as well.  

  Speaking of which, when I tried to ejaculate inside Mimon yesterday, I think she told me that this was an unsafe period for her. This must be a divine revelation telling me to sleep with her for a while and give her my seeds every day. 

  I was single in my Japanese past life, so of course I didn’t have any kids. I don’t know if it’s because of that but I really want to impregnate a woman right now.

  With my status and money in the house of Marquis, I could make a child with whomever I want as long as they are commoners. My elementary school teacher from my past life had taught me, “If you can do it, do it right away”. Therefore, I have to go for it.

  And so, after shooting out 3 loads in the morning today with Minith as well, I came to the innovation association. 

  Sex isn’t the only reason why I’m here though.

  I was informed that the arrowheads I asked the workshop of the innovation association to make yesterday had been completed. It seems that the senior worker in the workshop had finished them early.

  These arrowheads have a special powder mixed inside. It was a powder of a finely crushed manalal crystal that we seized from Rumon in Nambonan city. I negotiated with my father and had him give those crystals to me.

  I crushed and grinded one of those 3 manalal crystals down into powder with a file and handed it to the senior craftsman. 

  I did a little experiment to kill time when I was on my way back to Nyuneri and learned that a manalal crystal is a substance that has the special property of storing magic power.

  In a document I read before, it said that if you could turn manalal ores into crystals, they are believed to have the special property of being able to efficiently store magic power. It seems that the hypothesis was really correct.

  Since this special property does not change even in the form of powder, I was wondering if I could make weapons that contain magic power inside if I were to mix that powder into the iron that’s used to craft the weapon.

  Magic beasts that are created from the fog in the fields are weak to magic power and magic spells.

  The reason why nobles can act so arrogantly is that they can confront those magic beasts that are hostile to mankind since they possess magic power. 

  Only people with magic power can defeat the magic beasts that have grown so much that they could exit the fields.

  Therefore, subjugating magic beasts is a noble’s responsibility. Using the words from my previous life, it would be called noblesse oblige.

  Commoners rely on the feudal lords and the nobles to protect them from such magic beasts. A lord who can’t defeat the magic beasts will not only be inevitably hated by their citizens, that kind of noble will also be despised and mocked by other nobles.

  The standard combat tactic for battling magic beasts is to have ordinary soldiers form a wall, get the magic beast’s attention with bows and spears, and then the people who can use magic will use their attacks on the beast.

  If a weapon that’s made with powdered manalal crystals mixed in turns out to be effective against magic beasts, subjugating them might become even easier.

  In the case of the arrows this time, if I could stockpile a bunch of those arrows with magic power in them and expect them to do damage to magic beasts when ordinary soldiers fire them, taking down magic beasts with just saturation firing from ordinary people after some preparation might become possible.

  …Or so I thought.

  I gave the prototype manalal arrows to an ordinary soldier with no magic power to fire, but they were no different from normal arrows. The magic power that was stored inside the manalal arrows remained stored.

  Then I gave the arrows to a guard who possesses magic power to fire a few times, and the arrows were brimming with magic power. It seems that if the user doesn’t use a little bit of magic power to stimulate the arrow, the stored magic power won’t be released.

  I ended up making a useless weapon that is 『Magic arrows for commoners ( That requires magic power)』.

  Since I have magic power myself, I had overlooked the basic fact that I had been naturally stimulating the crystal with magic power. I’m such an idiot. 

  「Y-young master. I think it’s an interesting weapon still. It could be convenient when our magic power runs low or something」

  The words the guard used to comfort me made me feel more empty instead.

  One manalal crystal can make five manalal arrows. And the amount of magic power that one of these arrows can store is only the level of magic power my guards unleash when they cast a spell. That’s way too little.

  Moreover, once you put magic power in the arrows, the magic power will start to gradually escape, and it’ll be all gone after half a day. Their power to store magic power was also weak.

  If that’s the case, it would be much better to just use manalal crystals in their non-powdered form. Not only can one crystal store as much magic power as the amount of magic power I unleash when I cast my spells, but the magic power also doesn’t naturally leak out either. The larger the crystal, the more magic power it may also be able to store.

  Let’s think carefully about how to use the remaining manalal crystals from here on.

  「*Haaa…*」

  After I recorded a memo of the result of the experiment this time onto a wooden board, I took a sip of my tea.

  I had designated the task of making my tea especially to Mimon. There’s nothing better than sexually harassing her when she serves me my tea after all.

  「President」

  「What is it?」

  「If-If you don’t mind…Can I get off work earlier today?」

  Mimon said in a frightened tone. Maybe it’s because of the “sexual harassment sex” we had yesterday, I feel like she’s kind of trying to avoid me.

  However, I have already decided that I’m going to impregnate her. If possible, I want us to get along a bit better.

  「What’s the reason?」

  「My mother has a cold…and no one’s looking after my child. I came to work since there was work I needed to do in the morning, but I want to go take care of them in the afternoon」

  Mimon’s family structure seems to be a family of 6 consisting of Mimon’s mother, herself, and 4 of her children.

  Mimon’s mother is the one who normally looks after Mimon’s kids when Mimon is at work, but it seems that she collapsed last night. 

  A cold is not something that can be taken lightly. Due to there being healing magic in this world, medicine is not properly developed. It’s not uncommon for commoners to die of a cold.

  In this kind of situation, it can’t be helped that Mimon would want to go home to take care of her.

  Since I didn’t want to be the president of a “black” company, we have a much better standard compared to other companies in the city of Nyuneri when it comes to working overtime and taking days off. Beautiful female employees might get a bit of sexual harassment from the president and become pregnant after their vagina gets filled with white liquid, but just like that color, our company is definitely a “white” company.

  「If that’s the case, there’s no problem」

  「Thank you, sir」

  Mimon let out a sigh of relief and lowered her head.

  I decided on my plans for the afternoon inside my mind.

  And then, I came to Mimon’s home.

  Mimon, a regular employee of the innovation association, travels to work from her home that’s located in the residential area of the city. 

  Even though the residential area for commoners is located within the city, there is still a reasonable space assured for them to live in. However, due to the area being so densely populated, it’s always very crowded.

  The homes here were built of bricks and stones. I feel like there will be a large number of casualties if an earthquake happens.

  I don’t know if this is how it is for the whole Elluo continent, but at least in our territory, we don’t seem to get any earthquakes. If there are as many earthquakes here as there were in Japan from my past life, the city of Nyuneri will fall in a matter of seconds. 

  If anything, the only earthquakes that might occur would be like a volcanic earthquake at the tallest mountain that’s located at the center of the continent, Mt Erekthion. Since our territory is close to that mountain, I’m more scared of a volcanic eruption than an earthquake.

  Mimon’s house was the same as the other homes, a small house built of bricks.

  「…Um president, please come on in」

  「Right. Thanks for having me」

  I made my escorts wait outside near the house and entered Mimon’s home with her while I was dressed in a high-class commoner’s attire. 

  The inside of her house was cramped and dark. The air was a bit chilly and damp, and there was a faint smell of mold. Well, it wasn’t just her home, most commoner’s houses would be something like this.

  Anna’s home felt a bit more ventilated, but that’s in Nambonan city. It’s natural that things would be different here.

  「Mama, welcome back! …Onii-chan, who are you?」

  「Ah, hey, don’t be rude」

  A young girl had rushed up and jumped at Mimon after we entered the house. 

  Judging from her appearance, she’s probably around 4 or 5 years old. I can see features on her face that resemble Mimon’s so I’m sure that she’s going to grow up to be a beauty in the future.

  Mimon explained to her daughter that I’m a big shot at the workplace, and then she went into the room in the back of the house.

  Her mother who is sick with the cold was probably resting there. The reason Mimon’s daughter and I were waiting in this room might be to prevent us from catching it as well.

  Apparently, only this girl out of all Mimon’s children was in the house. Mimon’s other kids seemed to have gone to work or something.

  Her daughter who was left here by her mother got bored and approached me.

  「Onii-chan, why did you come here? Are you here to play?」

  I came here to make you some siblings…is not what I’m going to answer her with.

  「I came to cure your grandma’s illness. Look」

  I activated illumination magic and made a light sphere about the size of a baseball in the air.

  “Woww~” Mimon’s daughter raised her voice as she stared in admiration.

  「It’s magic! Amazing!」

  「Surprised? Onii-chan here can use magic」

  I rubbed the cheek of Mimon’s excited daughter.

  A child’s cheeks are very nice. They are delicate and mellow, and there is a youthful elasticity to them that makes me want to rub them forever.

  「Muuuuu, stopp it~」

  「Alright alright, shall I go make your grandma feel better then?」

  「Really?!」

  「Yeahh. What do you think? Onii-chan is amazing, isn’t he?」

  「Yahh!」

  Honest children are so adorable.

  Let’s give her the impression of a cool and wonderful onii-chan while I can. Several years down the line I want her to say “Onii-chan ♡ You’re amazing ♡” in my bed. It’s necessary to look at the long term when it comes to my sex life.

  While Mimon’s daughter held onto my sleeve, we went into the room in the back of the house. After we entered the room, Mimon raised her hand up in surprise to try to stop us as Mimon’s mother came into sight.

  A woman who looked like an older version of Mimon was lying there exhausted. After I lit up the room with illumination magic, I could see beads of sweat on her face. She looked like she was suffering quite a bit.

  「Um, president……?」

  「Here, just let me take a look at her」

  Since I was worried about Mimon and her daughter getting infected as well, I used healing magic on everybody in the room. At the same time, I also casted a stamina recovery spell on Mimon’s mother whose physical condition seems to be on the decline. 

  After a rainbow-colored glow appeared for a moment inside the room, Mimon’s mother opened her eyes and looked at her own arms and hands. A healthy complexion had returned to her skin.

  There aren’t many sicknesses out there that can’t be healed by the healing magic casted with noble-class magic power. 

  「My goodness!」

  「Mother?! You have to rest still!」

  Mimon’s mother literally jumped up and kneeled on the bed with her hands in front of her after her dramatic revival.

  Mimon’s daughter was impressed by the healing magic’s glowing effect and was clapping with her small and cute hands. 

  「I don’t know who you are, but we don’t have any money……」

  It takes a bit of money to receive healing magic. At the very least, it’s not something cheap enough that commoners could just thoughtlessly accept.

  Since they aren’t that well off as one can tell from their home, Mimon’s mother was probably worried about money.

  「No worries. I decided to do this for Mimon on my own. I will not charge any money for this. So, are you cured now? Your stamina should have recovered too」

  「Y-yes. I feel like a strange power had gushed out from inside of me. My hips were healed and my body has become very light」

  Mimon’s mother twisted her waist left and right. I think she’s somewhere in her mid 40s. The humans of this world age pretty well even if they have no magic power. They don’t look that different compared to people from my previous life on Earth. 

  She’s barely on the high-end of my strike zone, but since I want to sleep with Mimon today I’m going to ignore her for today. 

  「President…Thank you for healing my mother」

  Mimon was about to kneel down like her mother, but I grabbed her arm and stopped her.

  「There’s no need to thank me. With this, we can continue doing what we did yesterday without any worries then, right?」

  I slid my hand behind her rubbed her ass.

  As I smiled at her, Mimon looked at her mother and her daughter.

  Then, after she closed her eyes while frowning and let out a slow sigh, she opened her eyes again and looked towards me with a look of resignation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 70: Savoring the Widowed Mother Employee Who Was Remaining Faithful to Her Late Husband (½)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Before Mimon even said anything, her mother seemed to have noticed something and took Mimon’s daughter out of the house. They seemed to be going for a stroll.

  It saves me the trouble when she could read the mood in the air. If Mimon’s daughter were to say to me “Don’t bully my mama~” or something, I would have hesitated after all. However, my cock was already crazy hard.

  「President……Um, why……?」

  「Why what?」

  「Why do you want to do it with an old hag like me……? The age difference between us is as far as a parent and a child. We mustn’t…」

  Mimon is 28 and I’m 12. There is a 16-year age difference between us.

  Since it’s not weird for 16-year-olds to have experience giving birth already, what she said was not completely wrong from how the people of this continent would view it. I mean, Mimon should have been 17 when she gave birth to her eldest son.

  Basically, I look like a pervert who wants to have sex with a woman who is at an age where she could be my mother.

  「Age difference is silly. I just want to sleep with you」

  I moved my hand that was on her butt up and down and enjoyed the feel of it.

  It was nice and big as I thought. I felt my crotch getting tighter as the urge of wanting to hit it soon strengthened.

  「Please don’t……」

  I hugged Mimon who was covering her face with the palms of her hands. 

  It feels nice to rest my face on her chest. I want to spoil myself just like that.

  「The bed over there is nice and big. Sit down there」

  「Ah……」

  Mimon’s back shivered for a second.

  This room that her mother was resting in is like a bedroom. There are 3 big beds lined up next to each other.

  Since she said she’s in a family of 6, Mimon and her children probably normally sleep in pairs on these beds.

    「Um…the beds here are for the kids, come this way…」

    After she said that, she moved to a different bed than the one I told her to sit on.

    It makes no difference to me which bed we use, so I followed her obediently.

  「Dear…I’m sorry…」

  My ears picked up what Mimon muttered under her breath clearly.

  「Hmm? Could this bed be the one you used to sleep with your late husband on? I see. It’s just the right size to have sex on」 

  Mimon’s shoulders suddenly trembled before she looked away. Then, she just stayed silent and didn’t reply.  

  It looks like I guessed it right.

  She has to mate with another guy on the same bed that she made love to her husband on…Oh no, I feel like I can already cum soon.

  I quickly sat down on the bed that Mimon sat on as well.

  The bed is probably a cheap one since I heard the wood creak. However, this is exciting in its own way.

  「President, please, just the contraceptive..please allow me to use it」

  「Why?」

  Mimon asked me while I was messing up her clothes little by little.

  「That’s…because I’ll end up with a child……」

  That would be excellent. My first objective here is to fuck her, but my second objective is to impregnate her.

  I held onto Mimon’s hand with a big smile.

  「What’s wrong with that?」

  「Um……」

  After she said that, Mimon minced her words as she gave me her explanation. To put it simply, she told me that since she was the main pillar of this household, their family will go broke if she got pregnant, and she doesn’t want to have sex because she hasn’t forgotten about her late husband yet.

  「There’s no problem if it’s money you’re worried about」

  When I said that, Mimon looked at me in silence. Her purple eyes were beautiful.

  「……B-but, I’m an old hag, and president is still young, so…」

  On this continent, a 28-year-old woman is indeed considered to be quite old. If I were to compare it to Japan from my past life, I think this would be the equivalent of a 40-year-old woman getting with a boy who is in highschool.

  I see. It’s inevitable that she would think that I’m going to get sick of her and toss her away quickly. Since her household will collapse if I just got her pregnant and dumped her, it’s natural for her to be cautious.

  But from what I can see from Mimon’s mother at least, I can make the assumption that Mimon will be a beautiful woman even when she’s older. Taking that into consideration, I would probably easily have about 15 more years where I would want to sleep with her.

  Moreover, since my feelings for her will probably grow after sleeping with her for several years as well, I’m not going to just dump her like that. I’m not that cold-hearted.

  「I don’t know what you’re thinking about, but don’t think that I’m going to let you go so easily like that. I’m going to be giving you love for a long time」

  I took this chance to use my handsome face that I was born with and smiled at her before hugging her.

  A faint scent of soap tickled my nostrils.

  「Ah……but……」

  「It has been hard for you to raise all the kids by yourself, right? Do not worry. If you give birth to my child, your mother, your kids, I’ll protect them all. You know I can, right? I’m the president of the innovation association」

  For a moment, I could somehow tell that my words made her heart sway.

  But even with that, she seemed like she was still thinking about her late husband or she had some other worries.

  In order to keep her silent, I grabbed her chin with my hand.

  Since she was naturally taller than me when we were sitting down as well, I didn’t need to raise her chin up and just kissed her while holding onto her chin like that.

  「Mnnn…chuu…Uuu…」

  「Mmpuahh. Mimon, one more time」

  I pressed my lips back on her mouth once again after we separated, and then I nibbled on her lips. Our lips were tightly joined together as she received my kiss.

  When I extended my tongue to lick her like I was brushing her gums, perhaps she did not like that, so she ended up using her tongue to push me away from the side to try to stop me.

  「Chuuuu…Nnnnn…Nnnchuuu…Nnooo…Nnnpuahh…!」

  「Chuuum…chuuu! Haah…Mimon, more」

  We stared at each other for a moment after our lips parted before we started kissing again.

  「Nmmmuuu…Nchuu….chuu…nnnmmaa…muahhh…haa…haaah…hahhh…chuu」

  On this stage that is the inside of Mimon’s mouth, two tongues violently intertwined with each other.

  The sticky, hot saliva seemed to be all soaking into her mouth.

  My body was already burning with the flaming desire to join bodies with her but I held on.

  「Nnnnn……Stop, President. N…Chu」

  As I continued to kiss her for the next little while as I savored her taste, she moved her body as if she did not want it.

  I strongly held onto the back of her head with my hands and parted my lips from hers just slightly. We looked at each other from a distance where the clear bridge of saliva did not sever.

  「Please……Stop kissing me……」

  I kissed her again without saying a word back.

  Then, I pushed her down onto the bed with all I had and stuck my tongue inside her mouth even deeper.

  「Haah! Nchuuu….Behh…Chuuchuuu…Unnnn…NNnnn! Chuuuuuhaa, haaaa…!」

  「Puhaaaa….Forget about your late husband’s kisses. Remember how I taste」

  「Nnn! Noo, Mmmuuuu! Chuuu…re…Nnn…Chuuchuu…Chuuu. Stop……!」

  Our faces were so hot and sweaty that it was as if we had a fever.

  The watery sounds of our kisses echoed in the room. As Mimon’s resistance weakened, the more our soft tongues became entangled with each other.

  I don’t know how long our lips overlapped for, but we no longer worried about our breathing or panting.

  「Chuuu…Ah, Mimon. Very good」

  「Haa, haa, haaa…nguuu…Haaa…Haaa…, Y-yesterday wasn’t this…」

  Mimon said with saliva glowing on her pale cheeks.

  Since I really wanted to put it in her no matter what yesterday, I just shoved it in there without any foreplay or caressing. Today, I wanted to enjoy her body for as long as I can.

  I shifted my body up a bit while I was on top of her and whispered into her ear,

  「Your daughter probably won’t be back for a while. Let’s have some fun」

  With that, I started to undo Mimon’s messy clothes.

  First, I took off her top. She was left with an undergarment that is similar to a sleeveless shirt.

  Then, I buried my face into the mounds on her chest for a little bit and enjoyed the softness through the cloth. It was warm and comfortable.

  「Ah……」

  From there, I untied the cloth around her waist that acted as a belt and pulled down her skirt.

  「You have a slim waist, Mimon. It’s so slim that it looks like it could just snap」

  Her ass was big but her waist was slim. It’s so thin that I feel like it could just accidently snap.

  Since her chest was not anything too amazing, it couldn’t be called a full hourglass figure. However, her waist and her butt definitely made the cut.

  As I removed her wet underwear with all my might, I saw a vagina that was as moist as a tropical rainforest. 

  She probably hasn’t shaved ever since her husband passed away. There was a thick layer of pubic hair all around.

  「Oh what? It looks like you’re already perfectly ready for it. Even though you were saying no, you are this wet……」

  After I dipped my finger in as the jungle expedition force, it made a “kuchii” sound.

  I also had this feeling when we had sex yesterday…that Mimon might be the type that gets wet easily.

  「Ahhhh……! Ahhhh……!」

  She moaned out in embarrassment and attempted to cover her crotch with her hands.

  While I suppressed my impatience, I took all of my clothes off.

  My cock that was erect at a wonderful angle, as always, appeared right before Mimon’s eyes.

  「Mimon. This is the young cock that will be going in you from now on, you see?」

  I slid my cock up and down on her vagina as I teased her. It was still a child’s cock that was only half peeled back. 

  Recently it’s only during an erection that I could pull the foreskin fairly back. I think after I get a bit older, the skin would pull back by itself without anyone touching it.

  「Look. Use this young cock properly like how you would use an adult’s cock to make children」

  My half-peeled back erect cock approached Mimon as she laid on her back. 

  I was going to use my hands to peel the skin back, but Mimon picked up the base of my cock with her hand for some reason.

  「Mnuu……」

  And the next moment, Mimon took my cock into her mouth.

  「Ouhh!」

  I unintentionally moaned out in this unexpected blowjob development.

  Her tongue touched the tip of my cock as if she was scouting the area, then she narrowed her lips and pushed the foreskin of my cock back splendidly for me.

  What refined movements. I’m sure she had developed those techniques with her late husband.

  「Nice. Do it slowly just like that. 」

  「Nnn…*Slurpp*…Nnnn…Ahmuuu…*Slurrp*…! *Suck*, *Suck*…Nnnn! *Slurppp! ….*Slurpp*! Haaah, mm, Ahmm! 」

  Despite the gloomy aura she gives off, Mimon was really good at giving a blowjob.

  Due to her caressing technique that uses whole head movements to rub the tip of my cock with the insides of her mouth, I felt myself run up the staircase of pleasure in an instant.

  Even though she normally acts gracefully, the fact that she could suck like such a whore made me so excited.

  I softly placed my hand on her head as she continued the intense back and forth sucking movements.

  「Ahh…Amazing, Mimon. It feels really good……」

  Perhaps it was due to me saying that, her movements slowed down a bit.

  「Is a young cock that delicious?」

  Her movements froze and looked up at me with her cute round eyes.

  I silently moved my hand to the back of her head and pulled her head towards me as if I was telling her to keep going.

  「*Slurpp*…*Suckk*…*Suck*, Nnnn…*Slurp*…Mmm…*Slurp*…*Slurp*!」

  「Uggh…! This is too good……!」

  Mimon was using the tip of her tongue to quickly lick the sensitive spot that she had discovered about me.

  As her sticky tongue went all over my cock as I felt the urge to cum. It felt like she was telling me to cum faster, faster, faster.

  I wanted to just shoot my load on one hand, but on the other hand, I also wanted to keep on enjoying this pleasure.

  Although I was writhing in agony as I tried not to cum from her blowjob, I changed my body position and brought my face closer to her crotch. A stuffy smell then pierced my nostrils.

  After my hand reached her private area, I inserted my middle finger into her vagina. The love juice that was in there acted as lube and guided my finger deep inside.

  「Ahh?!」

  When I pulled my middle finger back out, love juice dripped down from it and created a tremendous female scent.

  Since she stopped sucking, I caressed her head to tell her to keep on going. Then she immediately took my cock back into her mouth.

  I adjusted my body position little by little as I continued to stimulate her private area with my hand. 

  If there were somebody peeping at us on the roof, they would probably see that Mimon and I were starting to get into a 69 position.

  As I endured her intense blowjob, I had finally reached the position with Mimon’s pussy right in front of me like how I wanted.

  「Hohh…This is an amazing smell…」

  I became lightheaded after I took a big sniff with my nose. Having the scent of a female who was overflowing with lust caressing my nostrils made me want to cum.

  I was drawn to her private area like I was fascinated by that scent. Then, I stuck my tongue out.

  「…Huh?! Hiiihh?!」

  Due to the room being dim and her fluttering pubes covering her vagina, I couldn’t tell where her clitoris was. So, I decided to just try giving it a lick.

  Mimon moved her body as if she was trying to get away when I ran my tongue all over there, but I held onto her body firmly so she could not move.

  「Nnnaaaaaah! Ahhhh?! W-what are you d-?! Ah ♡  Uahh?! President, Y-you mustn’t! Hiihh!」

  I was searching for her hidden clitoris with my tongue.

  I swished some saliva out of my mouth and applied it on her vagina, further stimulating her.

  Since her blowjob had completely stopped in the middle, I lightly moved my hips to silently urge her to keep on licking my cock. 

  「Ahmn」

  I felt my cock being enveloped in her mouth again. I couldn’t see it, but it seems that she was back at it.

  I also decided to dive my face into her private area and work my tongue there.

  I somehow endured the tongue technique that she used to try to make me cum.

  She must know that the best way to stop my licking attacks was to make me cum.

  An intense 69 battle was unfolding between us. And after a long battle, it was my victory.

  Mimon’s sucking became weak and her breathing became rough.

  Her vagina that was overflowing with love juice was screaming out as it waited for a male genital to be inserted. My cock was also at its limit.

  I got up and hugged Mimon’s limp, trembling body as I adjusted our position to the missionary position.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 71: Savoring the Widowed Mother Employee Who Was Remaining Faithful to Her Late Husband (2/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When I thought that it was about time to start putting it in and changed my body’s positioning, the bed screamed out in creaking sounds.

  The sounds were quite loud, maybe it’s because the bed is pretty old.

  I know that Mimon gave birth to four kids…but how the heck did she and her late husband have sex on this bed?

  Not only could we hear the bed creaking in this room, I think people from nearby rooms would be able to kind of hear it as well. I feel like it would have been hard for Mimon and her late husband to have private love time after they had her first child.

  Well, whatever. I don’t really care about something like that.

   「It looks like you’re ready to take it in there」

  In order for us to do it in the missionary position, I grabbed Mimon, who was lying face-up, by her legs. Then, I spread her open without her really resisting me. Her pubes were so drenched with love juice that you could almost see strings on her pubes.

  When I stared at her, she had a fake smile that seemed like it was put on for appearance’s sake. However, her rough breathing was leaking out from the crack of that smile due to her being sexually excited.

  「Hahh……haa…Ah, ahhh…! Haa…*Fuu*…」

  It seems that the female instincts in her had been overstimulated because we had gone down on each other for a while. Mimon was looking at me with a blank look in her purple-colored eyes.

  Although I felt a bit creeped out by her fake smile and her gaze that was wandering here and there, I decided to make my next move.

  I grabbed my cock that could explode anytime now and gently pressed it on her pussy that kept on slightly opening and closing.

  「I’m going to put it in slowly」

  I lowered my hips just a tiny bit and pushed the tip of my cock in her.

  *Squeeze*, *Squeeze*, *Squeeze*, her moist pussy that was slowly heating up strongly tightened on the tip of my cock as if it was whispering to it to tell it to come in further.

  「Ahnnnn…! *Fuu*, *fuuu*… Ah, ahhhh…! Ahhhhh…!  Hahh……!」

  Without losing my momentum, I steadily proceeded into the depths of Mimon’s vagina as if I was inspecting the shape of her vagina.

  Since her vaginal walls were repeatedly contracting, the stimulation was extremely pleasant.

  「I’m going in all the way」

  When I shoved my cock deep inside her with all the power I had in my hips, Mimon screamed out in a high pitch voice that sounded like it was mixed with happiness and sorrow as she pushed her hips up and arched her back.

  「AHHHhhhhHHHHHHhhh!!」

  She threw her hands over her head like she was about to pitch a baseball and grabbed onto the bed sheets tightly. Then, she continued to scream out with her mouth wide open and her tongue sticking out. 

  Perhaps it’s because she was clinging onto her consciousness while she fell into pleasure; she looked just a little weird as she kept that forced smile on her face. 

  She still had a sleeveless undergarment on, but I had purposely left that there. I rolled that no sleeve underwear up just enough so that her bare tits were showing.  

  「They look so good hanging out like that」

  I put my hands on those breasts that were hanging to the sides due to gravity and enjoyed their soft feel..

  These lumps of softness that fit nicely in my hands were filled with a sense of maturity.

  Her round, dark red nipples that stand out even in the dimness were sitting up on her sloppy mounds as if they were insisting on being sucked.

  「*Chummuu*…」

  「MMnhhhh?!」

  I decided to have fun with both her upper body and lower body at the same time.

  As my tongue ran all over the nipple that’s in my mouth, I continued to thrust her violently.

  「Unnn…Ahhh…AHHH…President…Noo, nothing is going to come out even if you suck on it like that…MmmUu!」

 「…*Puahh*. What? I’ll make things come out of them again soon」

  I slammed my hips into her with a big swing.

  Then, I pulled my cock back out to the entrance of her vagina before I shoved it back into the deepest part of her in one go again.

  「Ahh! Ahhhh ♡ Ahhh!  Ahhh! Ahhh! Mnnnn!」

  Love juice started to get blown out from her vagina due to the force of my thrusts, darkening the rag-like bedsheet.

  As the bed creaked in a rhythm, Mimon’s moaning that sounded like she was in the middle of pain and pleasure echoed loudly in the room.

  「Nnnnm Mmnnn! Ahhhh! Ahhhhn! Nooo! Ahh! Ahhh! Stoppp! Q-quickly…Please finish quickly! I don’t like this! Ahhhhh…T-this isn’t right…! Haa」

  Veins could be seen on her hands that were tightly gripping onto the bed sheet. The neat bed was getting messy since she was pulling on the bed sheet so hard it was like she’s trying to tear it off.

  I gradually slowed down my hips’ movements and came in close contact with her skin.

  I actually wanted to whisper into her ear, but since I couldn’t reach there due to me not being tall enough in this position, I simply opened my mouth on the spot. 

  「There’s no need to be so impatient, we can just take it slow and have a fun time」

  *Mmmhh*! , she screamed out in a high pitched voice like a virgin when I poked at her womb with a crushing force.

  Playing with the body of a grown woman and making her moan out like a virgin was giving me an indescribable sense of superiority. 

  But on the other hand, I really didn’t like how she was trying to keep a smile on her face even though she was getting messed up by the pleasure. I feel like I’m having sex with a woman who was wearing a mask.

  I wanted to enjoy her as she makes a wild expression with moans that come from the bottom of her heart.

  「Stop forcing yourself to smile」

  I said as I condemned her with a sudden thrust.

  Then, Mimon unexpectedly looked surprised and replied to me while she panted.

  She told me this and that as her reason, but since she already spoiled my fun I didn’t accept any of that and just told her to stop smiling like that.

  「I want you to show me the real you. Only for me to see」

  I gently stroked her cheek, then I started to move my hips intensely to destroy that fake smile on her face.

  The bed was making earsplitting creaks as our sex stage shook violently.

  「Annn! Haah ♡ Noo, president! Ah, we can’t! Haaah!  Hahh…! Haah! 」

  「Good, Mimon. You’re beautiful. This look you’re showing now is the best…!」

  「Stop, please stop……! Uuuuu! Ah ♡ Ah♡ Hahh, Ahhh, ahhhh…! S-stop please…Quickly…! Please just finish quickly…!」

  Mimon moaned with her real expression after her fake smile collapsed. I gave her great praise as I caressed her clitoris with my finger. 

  After she made those piercing, high pitched moans, her hands were grabbing everywhere on the bed as she breathed heavily.

  「You’re going to remember the shape of my cock. Forget about your ex-husband’s thing」

  「Nooooo! Hiih ♡ Ahhhh! Mm, faster! Fasterrrr! Ahhh! President, fasterrrr! Fasterr ♡ AHhhhHhhhHHH!」

  The bed looked like it was going to break from Mimon’s movements that were even more intense than the way I was moving my hips.

  To think a woman who is such a graceful lady on the outside could be this wild in bed. That is surprising.  

  「Only my cock will be entering you from now on. Remember it thoroughly…! Your pussy is already for my use exclusively」

  「Ahhhhh! Nooo! Ah ♡ Ahh! Ahhhh! Dear! Dearrrr! A-Ahhh! Dearrr! Noooo!!」

  I hugged Mimon with all my strength as she arched her back and screamed out continuously. Then, I raised my thrusting speed to the max limit.

  「I’m going to give you tons of my children now! Guhhh…! I-I’m cumming! Get pregnant! Get pregnant with my child! 」

  「AHHHHhhh!!!  AHh ♡ AHHHHHHH!! 」

  *Spurrtt! * *Spurttt!, my semen splattered inside her. 

  Her vagina continued to contract rapidly as my seeds flowed into it, urging me to keep on ejaculating.

  *Spurt*, *Spurttt*, *Spurtt*, the rest of my remaining semen continued to come out as if it was attracted to her body.

  Her delicate vaginal walls that were gently snuggling with my cock were giving off the warmth of a female who was used to taking in a male’s cock with a rhythm that’s matching my ejaculation.

  「Haa…Ah, ahhhh…Mimon… That was great…」

  「*Fuuu*…*Fuuuu*…♡」

  As Mimon looked up while breathing heavily, I couldn’t kiss her even though I wanted to since I couldn’t reach her.

  In front of my lonely mouth was her breasts that were rising up and down with her breathing.

  「Ahmmnn *chuu*」

  After I gobbled her nipple up, Mimon’s body trembled for only a moment, but that was all.

  As my cheek touched her sweaty skin, they stuck together due to both of our sweat.  I felt a sense of peacefulness and closed my eyes as I sucked on her nipple.

  Perhaps it was done subconsciously, Mimon gently put her hand on the back of my head and caressed me like a baby. Her warmth and kindness were both transmitted to me from the palm of that hand.

  As I became enveloped by her satisfying motherly love, my consciousness drifted into slumber.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 72: Views on Sex 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Due to the feeling of satisfaction and tiredness I felt after I gave Mimon a thick load, and the sense of security from being enveloped in her breasts, it seems that I fell asleep for just a bit.

  Then when I woke up and pulled my completely withered cock out of her, Mimon cleaned it for me with her mouth without saying anything.

  Thanks to that, my cock became lively again and I gave her another load in her vagina.

  But because I was thrusting my hips too hard, semen splashed out everywhere and I ended up really dirtying the bed.

  I felt bad for Mimon who has to clean the bed afterwards, so while I was taking a break after I finished shooting my load, I contacted Tesh and had him get a cleaning crew here.

  That is why I decided to have a talk with Mimon in another room until the cleaning is done.

  「President…If I got pregnant…will you really look after us…?」

  Mimon said with a tone that sounded like she had gathered her resolve while we were enjoying some tea together.

  「I’ve told you many times already, didn’t I? I will support you financially even if you can’t work because you’re pregnant. And if your children are willing to work seriously, I could hire them in the innovation association as well. However, I’ll fire them if they mess around though」

  「In the association…! That would be so nice」

  Mimon let out a deep breath. It seems that she’s finally relieved.

  Working in the city of Nyuneri is the same as everywhere else, it’s basically all about connections. No one will hire you if you just go to a company or a workshop and say “Hire me”. In most cases, most people will only hire their relatives, people they know, or people who have trustworthy people vouching for them.

  When I think about that, our innovation association slightly deviated from the norm since we used employment tests to hire our workers. But thanks to that, we were able to pick up many capable individuals who were talented but had no jobs, so it ended up working out. Well, we picked up many disappointing people as well because of that but more than two-thirds of them will be fired along the way.

  Mimon could read and write, of course, but she could also do mathematical calculations and she has a very serious work attitude.

  In this continent where there are fewer people who worked as hard as people from Japan in my past life, someone like Mimon is extremely rare. If it’s her kids, it’s possible that they would have personalities similar to hers, so I don’t mind hiring them.

  I did not make that decision just because I have my eyes on her body.

  「Sheesh, trust me a little more」

  After I said that, Mimon responded with only a bitter smile.

  I closed our distance and hugged her, then I lightly kissed her on her lips.

  「You’re already my woman. Don’t worry」

  「……Okay」

  I gently rubbed her lower ab area. My seeds are in there. I rubbed her there with the thought of “Get pregnant~ Get pregnant~” in my mind.  

  I can’t help wanting to impregnate her when I see the sad look on her face.

  「Still, you were pretty crazy earlier. I didn’t think you could moan like that」

  It was a little surprising to hear Mimon scream out like an animal like that during sex since she’s the quiet, graceful lady type.

  That contrast from how she normally acts really made an impression on me.

  「Where did you and your late husband have sex? If your moans are that loud, you guys couldn’t have done that stuff in this house, right? That would be a little too stimulating for your children if they heard you」

  I came up with a topic with the intention of having some idle talk with her as I hugged her.

  Then, her shoulders trembled and she shook her head.

  「It’s different…」

  I stroked her hair in silence as she continued.

  「Me and my husband…we never did it for as long as when you and I do it, president……」

  「Hm?」

  Even though she looked somewhat uneasy and sounded like she didn’t really want to talk about it, Mimon told me many things as if she was making excuses for moaning like that.

  After hearing some of her explanations, I kind of understood what she was getting at, and the reason why she was smiling during sex.

  「…Is that how it is for all commoners?」

  「My mother taught me that way and every woman that I know says the same things」

  Let’s try to sum up what she said in my head.

  How commoner women view sex is completely different than the way I view it.

  To them, sexual intercourse is an act for the male’s enjoyment, and it seems to be very shameful for a woman to feel good on her end. A good wife is one that would smile at the guy during sex and silently obey the male and make him cum quickly.

  「That’s so boring」

  That’s just like having a meat hole for masturbation. What fun is there in that?

  But now I understand how they made 4 children in this cramped up house.

  Lick the cock, put it in, cum. Since their sex ends in those three steps, they just have to mate quickly in the small time frames that their kids aren’t around. It’s like how wild animals mate.

  「So what you’re saying is this was your first time taking your time to have sex?」

  「Yes」

  Mimon answered in a shaky voice with an expression that was filled with shame. She was moaning loudly as she drowned in pleasure today. From her view, that is nothing but lewd.

  However, to me, it was very satisfying. The most important thing about sex is to have both people feel good.

  「There’s no need to feel ashamed. I was happy that we were able to feel good together, Mimon」

  I embraced her strongly and whispered into her ear.

  「You like it that way too, right?」

  Her face turned even redder as she looked down even more. I can tell that she was slightly tightening up her fists that were on her knees.

  She did not reply, but it was clear that it was a yes.

  「I’ll call you to the villa next time. I’m going to make love to you all night so look forward to it」

  After she gave a small nod, I saw a natural smile on Mimon’s face.

  It seems that she’s going to forget about her late husband’s cock soon.

  By the time I returned to the castle, the sky was dyed in the color between evening and night.

  Since mother is going to be back from the royal capital in a few days, the servants looked like they were just a little busier than usual.

  I have some business to do in Nambonan city, but I’m going to leave after my mother returns. It seems that a servant who accompanied mother to the royal capital will be coming with me to Nambonan city this time. My condolences to that person for having to continuously go on business trips.

  I did not bring any servants with me last time since I went to Nambonan as a military personnel. But because I’m going as the mayor this time, I have to at least bring a couple of people with me.

  For the trip this time, it will be Tesh and one of the high-class maid servants that is coming back with my mother from the royal capital.

  

  People of this continent can’t just move to whatever city they like and live there like the people of Japan from my past life, so most commoners would spend their entire life in the same city they are born in unless they are caught up in a war.

  There are very few transportation methods in this continent as well, so something like leaving their hometown city that their livelihood depended on and going to a different city is like a once-in-a-lifetime event. 

  Moving to an unknown land is something that the people avoided more than I had thought.

  High-class servants refers to people who were hired as servants because they are either the descendents of a family of knights or because of some sort of blood relationship.

  They live and work in the castle of Nyuneri but they weren’t just citizens from the city of Nyuneri because they come here from all over our territory. They are the ones who serve the house of Qualdense and accompany us on trips.

  On the other hand, low-class servants are all local citizens who were hired as servants based on their connections, abilities, looks, and lineage.

  The low-class servants working at the castle of Nyuneri are all commoners from the city of Nyuneri, and the low-class servants working at other castles of other cities in our territory are all commoners from those cities. 

  Low-class servants do not have to go on trips. It’s more accurate to say that the low-class servants here are working for the castle of Nyuneri rather than the house of Qualdense.

  Since someone like Minith is the classic type of low-class servant, she doesn’t have to go to the royal capital or the city of Nambonan. She will stay here in the castle of Nyuneri.

  Tesh appeared out of nowhere without making a sound.

  「Young master. Your bath has been prepared」

  「Understood. I’ll be getting in at once」

  Although I wiped my body with a wet cloth, I was still feeling sticky for some reason.

  I got ready quickly and headed to the bath.

  The person who had been washing my body for me in the bath at the castle of Nyuneri has always been an old lady who was over 50 years old, but it was a different person today.

  When I asked what happened to her, it seems that the old lady had hurt her back and she said that it was about time she retired.

  That old lady is really good at washing me, so I’m a bit sad that she’ll no longer be here.

  「About who will be in charge of the bath from now on…Is there someone you would like to request?」

  In fact, a young maid was in charge of washing me initially.

  However, since I was a virgin at that time, I was too embarrassed to be washed by a young girl, so I gave that job to an old lady instead.

  「Let me think about it」

  「Understood」

  I’m not embarrassed anymore since I’m no longer a virgin.

  I could probably proudly show off my erect cock.

  While I thought about who should get the job, my whole body was washed for me.

Chapter 73: In the Bedroom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When I opened a window after I finished dinner and returned to my room, I felt just a slight chill from the autumn night breeze as the days became a lot cooler.

  After I wrote for a while at the desk in my room, Fanny came into the room while she was dressed in her autumn pajamas. The white one-piece pajamas made with silk really suited her well. 

  「Big Brother」

  Ever since Fanny found out that mother is coming back from the royal capital, she has been in a good mood constantly. Her smile that is in the process of changing from a girl’s to a woman’s has the charm of both sides, so I was unintentionally captivated by it.

  I had a servant prepare a chair for Fanny, then I decided to read books to her and talk to her like usual as we sat side by side at the desk. 

  「I wonder if mother is around here right now?」

  Fanny said as she pointed at the map of the continent in a book that just happened to be open. She was like this when grandfather was coming back too. When Fanny can’t wait for somebody to return, she likes to look at a map and think about where they are.

  Maybe she had been looking at a map when I was in Nambonan city as well. I stroked her hair as I imagined the scene of her doing that.

  「Let’s see…」

  There are many different types of maps that show each territory and each country’s borders, but there is only one type of map that covers the entire continent of Elluo. That type of map was created by the Synod with the enormous help from the bravest adventurers of the time during the Synod’s golden age, a time when they had full authority.

  It’s an extremely rare map that included the detailed landscape of the northern part of the continent that was covered by a field, the so-called great land of fog that even those adventurers would hesitate to enter.

  I pointed at the royal capital of the Levios kingdom that’s located on the eastern part of the continent.

  「Here is the royal capital, right?」

  「Yes」

  Then I moved my finger left and immediately pointed at the big river that was to the west of it. There are 7 large rivers on this continent, and this river is one of them.

  Judging from the content of mom’s letter and the date it arrived, I can assume that mother has already crossed that river. 

   「I’m sure that she has already crossed this big river」

  It would be nice if she could just go in a straight line back to our territory, but it’s not that simple.

  Since it would create trouble if she goes through the territory of nobles who aren’t friendly to our family, as long as it’s not an emergency, she will only go through areas owned by nobles who we have a good relationship with.

  Because of that, she is on a bit of a detour.

  「She said in the letter that she will be returning from this path…」

  I moved my finger in a zigzag as I went further west on the map.

  Then, I stopped moving my finger before another large river like before.

  「I think she would be around somewhere here right now」

  「Wow…! Then she’s almost back already」

  Once she gets past that big river, she’ll already be back in our territory.

  Fanny’s voice livened up as she smiled brightly. She seems really happy.

  「I hope that the water of that river isn’t rising so she could cross there though」

  「They can’t cross if the water rises?」

  「If the water rises to the point that it’ll flood, it’ll be dangerous even for big ships」

  Unlike the large river near the royal capital, the river near our territory gets its water from Mount Erekthion.

  There are 5 large rivers that have Mount Erekthion as their water source, and the secret to supplying that amount of water lies at the bottom of the mountain. 

  The vast field that covered the foot of the mountain seems to be always in the harsh environment of violent rainstorms.

  I don’t quite understand the phenomenon of rain being created from nothing, but that’s what a field is.

  In any case, the massive amount of rainwater created by the fog of that field is something that’s necessary for the existence of those rivers.

  The rivers often flooded when the rain got too heavy, but it wasn’t all bad because thanks to that, fertile soil is carried from upstream, producing a rich land that’s good for crops. It’s like the blessing of the Nile river of Earth in my past life. 

  「If the current looks strong, she’ll probably go a bit south and cross the river at a spot where the river is narrower. Since she will be in the Silopea family’s territory if she does that, I wonder if she’ll be a little late」

  I moved my finger a bit lower on the map and pointed at a spot where the width of the river is narrower, then I slid my finger left to motion the crossing of the river.

  The area my finger landed on after that is the territory under Earl Silopea. That’s where my cousin Plume lives.

  If mother is going through their territory, she will probably spend a night there at their castle. That’s because Plume is my mother’s niece.

  「I wonder if Plume-oneesama is doing well. Instead of just exchanging letters with her, I want to see her in person」

  「Yeah. I wish she’d come visit us sometime」 

  「Yes. I have lots I want to talk to Plume-oneesama about」

  Plume had lived in the castle of Nyuneri for about a year in the past before, so Fanny had grown quite attached to her.

  I gently pulled Fanny’s head to my chest and hugged her since she looked a bit lonely, and then I placed my chin on her head.

  「Big brother, are you going to Nambonan again? I will be so lonely」

  Fanny pressed the back of her head strongly on my chest. The sweet scent of soap drifted from her glossy hair.

  「Don’t worry, I’m not going to stay there as long as I did last time. Probably」

  「Mm. Brother, please come back soon, okay?」

  Fanny looked up at me with her clear blue eyes.

  I feel like her thin, delicate pink lips were drawing me in.

  「Yeah. I’ll come back right away after I finish what I need to do there. Now…it’s about time for bed. What do you want to do, Fanny?」

  I asked her if she wants to sleep in my room or go back to her own room.

  「Hehe, big brother」

  Fanny did not answer my question and just rubbed her head on me.

  It seems that she wants me to carry her to the bed.

  「You’re still such a child, Fanny. Alright」

  After I returned the books back to the drawer of the desk, I put my one hand around her back, one hand behind her knees and carried her princess style. 

  Since the servants quickly pulled the blanket on the bed to make some space for us, I gently let Fanny down there and then I lay down next to her as well.

  「Young master, young lady, since it’s cold tonight, we have prepared a new blanket for you. Please let us know if you get too hot」

  「Okay」

  As we went deeper into autumn, our number of blankets increased. 

  The two servants worked together and put another blanket over me and Fanny. Are there feathers inside? The blanket is big and fluffy.

  I confirmed that the servant who was tasked with being the first one to take turns watching over us when we sleep was sitting down on a chair next to the bed.

  「Good night, Fanny」

  「Yes. Good night, big brother」

  As I stroked Fanny’s head, I turned off the illumination spell.

  The only light left that shined in the room was the moonlight, and only the sounds of breathing gently echoed in the silent room.

  After some time, I began to hear Fanny’s cute breathing coming from next to me after she fell asleep.

  I turned and glanced at her face as she clung onto me in her sleep.

  「Mmm……」

  When I gently touched her cheek, I felt a soft squishiness.

  I poked her cheek a few times and made sure that she was completely asleep.

  Since I always touch her cheeks, the servant who was watching us from next to the bed didn’t have any special reactions.

  I quietly moved my other hand under the blanket.

  Thanks to the fluffy blanket, the servant did not notice my hand moving under there.

  I gently moved to put that hand around Fanny’s waist, but she continued to be sound asleep. There was no reaction at all. 

  I stopped moving the hand that I was touching her cheek with and pretended to fall asleep myself.

  Then, I moved my hand that was on her waist a bit down and touched her butt. I’m not groping her though. So that in the unlikely event that she wakes up, I can just say that my hand slipped there.

  「Zzzz……」

  While constantly checking to see if Fanny was still asleep, I continued to touch her butt.

  How do I put this? I feel like a molester. It feels so exciting.

  Secretly touching her small, elastic, and healthy butt had a nice spicy thrill to it. It’s an amazing feeling.

  For the next little while, I enjoyed the feel of my beloved little sister’s butt.

  Since I’m afraid of things becoming weird if I touch her too much, I shook off the feeling of wanting to keep going and took my hand off her butt. 

    「*Fuu……*」

  With both of my hands out of the blanket, I played with her cheeks that are okay to touch as I fell asleep.

  The next morning, Fanny’s face was right in front of mine when I opened my eyes.

  I instinctively felt like giving her a wake-up kiss, but I unintentionally made eye contact with the servant next to my bed.

  「Mnn……」

  I looked at Fanny’s face that was young yet had a nice set of features.

  When I was thinking that her hair and her long blue eyelashes that were the same as mine were beautiful, she woke up as if she responded to my gaze. 

  「Mmm…big brother」

  「Good morning, Fanny」

  「…Yes. Good morning…」

  With a still sleepy expression on her face, she looked at me with a pair of clear blue eyes.

  As I stroked her bed hair, her beautiful eyes closed again.

  「Fanny. It’s morning already」

  「Mmmm…I’m still sleepy…? Hm…?」

  Suddenly, Fanny opened her eyes again and quickly put her hand in the blanket.

  Her sleeping face gradually changed into a face of worry.

  「Fanny?」

  「Big brother…for some reason…something feels wrong?」

  I did touch her butt, but I didn’t do anything like sticking my hand into her underwear.

  Naturally, I didn’t ejaculate or anything either, so there’s no way she would have semen on her butt or something like that.

  「Young lady. What seems to be the problem?」

  The servant noticed something wrong about Fanny and approached us.

  I became worried too, so I decided to flip the blanket over with the intention of getting up.

  「Is this…?」

  「Kyaaa!」

  When I started to pull the blanket off, I saw both my body and Fanny’s.

  My pajamas were the same as when I went to bed last night, but there was something clearly different about Fanny’s. The crotch area of her pajamas was dyed in a blackish-red color. It’s probably dried blood.

  It was really standing out because her pajamas were white and the blood’s blackish red.

  「Ahhh…! B-brother…! Please don’t look…! Ahh… No…!」

  After the servant saw Fanny covering her face with her hands, the servant panicked and looked under the blanket.

  Then he probably got the gist of what happened, so he went to call a female servant over.

  「Young master, I’m very sorry, but please go to another room. Young lady seems to be not feeling well…」

  It’s not very often that I get kicked out of my own bedroom.  

  I was a bit hesitant on leaving Fanny while she was crying with her shoulders shaking, but since she told me to not look at her right now, it’s probably better if I’m not here. 

  「Okay. I’ll leave」

  I don’t think she wants people to see her blood-stained clothes, so I carefully got out of the bed while lifting the blanket as little as possible.

  After the servant guided me out of the room, a female servant that exclusively looks after Fanny entered my room together with the head maid.

  Since the other servants who took turns watching us sleep had to also leave the room, they guided me to another room.

  「*Haaahhh…*」

  I calmed down after I took a sip of the tea that I had the servants make me.

  My heart was still beating a bit fast after seeing her blood-stained clothes first thing in the morning right after I woke up.

  After some time, the head maid came to explain Fanny’s body condition to me.

  Basically, Fanny had her first period.

  She had already been taught about her first period and how menstruation works before, but it seems that she was surprised because it happened all of a sudden.

  She has regained her composure now after she had some alone time with her personal maid.

  And apparently, Fanny had received quite a shock because I saw the blood of her first period.

  The head maid bowed down to me and earnestly asked me to be careful about how I conduct myself to not upset Fanny any more than that.

  I have no intention of hurting Fanny either. I’ll watch what I say and how I act.

  But still, Fanny’s body is now able to bear children huh…

  Will we still sleep together? And will I still be satisfied with just touching her butt?

  I feel like it would be safer for us to not sleep together when I have pent up urges.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 74: Daily life in the Association
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If it was in my previous life in Japan, we might have cooked some red rice to celebrate, but unfortunately, there is no such tradition in this region. That includes the territory that we, the Qualdense, own. 

  So without any special celebration for Fanny’s first step towards adulthood, the usual everyday activities continued in the castle of Nyuneri.

  「Young masterr ♡  Ahh…*Chuu* ♡」

  Naturally, my normal daily activities include injecting my love into Minith and filling her with it.

  The bed that welcomed Fanny’s first period had its sheets replaced by new ones, and this time it wasn’t blood, but it was semen that scattered all over it instead.

  After our two rounds of battle ended, I had Minith use her mouth to clean my cute penis that had completely shrunk in size.

  「Mmm. *Chhuuu*… ♡  *Puah*… *Chuuuchuu*…! *Chuu* ♡」

  Her lips parted from my cock with a *Mmbok* sound.

  Minith’s skills in bed have been steadily rising.

  My still young body was very sensitive. Although I was becoming somewhat used to having sex with her, she is “leveling up” at a rate faster than that, so I end up cumming quickly every time.

  After Minith drank a cup of the scented water from the water pitcher, she snuggled up next to where I’m lying down on the bed. 

  「Oh right, there’s something I would like to ask you」

  「How may I help you? 」

  I decided to ask Minith what her views on sex are as a commoner female as I stroked her brown colored hair.

  According to Mimon, the common female believes that “sex is an act to satisfy the man. The most important thing is to smile and do what they are told.”

  When I told Minith that I heard that by chance and asked her about it, Minith nodded in response.

  「Yes. That was also how my mother taught me. I think it might be the norm for the women living in the castle town」

  「Is that so?」

  「It’s just that us maids were taught techniques to make guys happy from the head maid. Because of that, we…we might be more proactive compared to other women」

  Minith said with a slightly embarrassed look.

  Indeed, during our first time, Minith gave me a blowjob before I even asked, and she was doing things like moaning out in a cute voice to stimulate me. It does feel like that’s different from the views of the women in the castle town.

  Lately, Minith has been moaning so intensely that I think the faces of people down the hall were turning red. If her mother saw her like that, she might get treated as a bad, lewd daughter.

  「Don’t look so embarrassed. What do you think makes me the happiest?」

  「Eh? Hmm……going left and right with my tongue on the backside of it…」

  「Wait a second, that’s not what I meant」

  I do like her attacking like that, but that’s not what I was asking.

  「What makes me the happiest is when it’s not just me, but when both of us feel good. That’s why…there’s no need for you to be the only one trying so hard. Let’s feel good together, okay?」

  「…Wilk ♡」

  *Smooch*, she kissed me on my cheek. It seems that the switch had flipped from sex mode to sweet mode.

  I hugged Minith’s head and caressed her ab area where I shot my seeds into. Do your best, my seeds. 

  *Chuu*, *chu*, *chuu*, *chuu*, *chuu*, while I repeatedly kissed my beloved Minith’s neck like a baby who is asking for a tit, I bathed in the afterglow of our lovemaking.

  When I entered the bath later, the usual old woman who usually washed me was there.

  After she thoroughly washed my body, she bowed deeply to me and officially told me that she wants to retire soon.

  I could easily heal something like back pain with my recovery magic, but she told me that she had been thinking about retiring for a while now and she wants to use this injury as the chance to do.

  Since I also don’t want to force somebody to stay if they don’t want to, I just compliantly accepted her request and got out of the bath.

  「Who do you think should take on the task of washing me from now on, Tesh?」

  I casually asked Tesh, who had been waiting at the entrance of the bathhouse. 

  「Since there are many people who want to take on the job, I think it’s best if you pick out a person you like, young master. If you want, I can gather all of those people who wish to do the job together」

  Then when I asked him for their names, he started with the names of the maids I knew, followed by a bunch of names that I wasn’t too familiar with.

  To name the female servants first…Tesh really gets it.

  By the way, even though he named some male servants as well, those servants don’t have that kind of interest, they just want the pay. They were definitely not aiming for my asshole.

  「I think I want to see all of them at least once first. Make the arrangements for it」

  「As you wish, young master」

  Until I come to a decision of who’s going to take on the job, the current old bath lady will have to work for just a bit longer.

  For the next few days, my peaceful everyday life continued.

  I planted my seeds in Minith in the morning, and then Mimon in my office at the innovation association in the afternoon. Every day was truly productive.

  Unfortunately, Fanny didn’t come to my room to play at night anymore. She is probably feeling conscious about her period.

  Therefore, I ended up sleeping through the lonely autumn nights by myself.

  Mother is still not back in the city of Nyuneri yet.

  Fanny was noticeably disappointed that my predictions were wrong.

  「Well then, please excuse me」

  「Mmhm」

  The middle-aged manager left my office after he finished reading his report to me. Since I’ve been coming to the association every day lately, the managers have been taking that opportunity to present things to me and ask for my decision.

  It seems that the work that had accumulated from my trip to Nambonan last time was getting dug up every day. 

  In the last few days, I would have sex with Mimon when she brings me tea.

  But today’s schedule had already been decided.

  「President, your tea is ready」

  「Good work」

  Mimon entered my room after she brewed me some tea.

  When I beckoned her over with my hand, she placed the tray that had a cup of tea on it down on a nearby desk and approached me. 

  I put my hand around her hips and pulled her to me with all my strength, then I kissed her and sucked on her tongue.

  「*Chuu*…*Chuuu*…*Hahhhh*…*Chuuchuu*…*President*……」

  「*Hahh*, *haa*……Mimon. *Chuu*」

  Normally I would have pushed her down on the sofa right there.

  「President…today…」

  「Yeahh. That’s right」

  Maybe it’s because I’ve been having sex with her every day, Mimon’s female instincts that had been sleeping since her husband passed away have been gradually waking up.

  Her voice gets louder every time we do it, and she resisted less as well. Even the kiss we had just now…At first, only I would be doing the sucking, but now she sucks on my tongue back.

  Mimon still talks about her husband, but it’s clear that her body is craving for a guy like me.

  She’s been worrying about doing it in the association as she became more sensitive every day. She thought it was embarrassing to be heard by her co-workers, but at Mimon’s house, there’s her mother and daughter.

  After I found out about her struggle, I wanted to give her the last push here and I invited her to the mansion.

  「So, is today alright with you?」

  「Yes…I have told my mother that I’m going to stay out overnight today」

  When I see her looking down timidly like that, it makes me want to attack her right here.

  But I’m going to do my best to endure it. The fun time is going to be tonight.

  I told her to leave my office as I felt heartbroken.

  Since I had nothing to do until the association closes for the day, I decided to wander around in the company building.

  My crotch area was already getting hard, so if I stayed in my office I feel like I would have started jerking off.

  Since I heard a familiar voice when I walked by the break room, I quietly got closer to it.

  「Mimon, Mimon」

  「Ah, Eve. What’s the matter?」

  「Please look at this. Look, I made it just like how you taught it. Did I do it right?」

  「Oh my~ that’s good. You’re skilled, Eve」

  When I snuck a peek inside the break room, I saw Mimon and Eve having a fun talk together.

  Eve was showing Mimon a tote bag that was made with linen or something. They seemed very happy somehow.

  The “Give Eve the cold treatment order” that I issued out at the association and the villa has been temporarily canceled some days ago since Eve voluntarily slept with me.

  She is now properly addressed by her name, treated as a normal employee, and she could talk to other employees as well.

  That’s why I have been receiving reports that Eve had started talking to other female employees. Mimon was also one of them.

  Apparently, Mimon had been worried about Eve the whole time since Eve always looked lonely in the association. For that reason, Mimon has been approaching her proactively as soon as the cold treatment order was lifted.

  Somehow, Eve reminds me of a child who is being spoiled by her mother.

  Eve’s hair is honey-colored and gives off a feeling of elegance. And due to a pleasant diet and her using the bath every day, her hair is smooth and glossy.

  On the other hand, Mimon’s hair is like banana or yellow paprika or lemon colored. Even though she is a meek person, her hair color is very flashy.

  Since both of them have similar hair color, if someone looks at them from behind, they could easily be mistaken as a mother and daughter.

  As I secretly stared at that scene that put a smile on my face, Eve waved her hand and walked out of the break room.

  Eve finished organizing the documents in the reference room and is now writing endless copies of documents. Since I want her to make manuscripts of the documents in the Nyuneri castle eventually, I want her to get good at writing soon.

  In order to give her practice writing the letters, I had her keep a daily diary too. I bought her the same kind of diary I’m using.

  Before, when I had snuck in Eve’s room to read her diary in my spare time, I saw things like what she had fun with and what made her happy on those days written in detail.

  I noticed that she tried really hard to focus only on the positives and write about them since she was having a rough time.

  Since she was only writing down things that she was happy about, I wondered what she would write if I kissed her, so I tried giving Eve the biggest deep kiss when she came home one day.

  The next day, when I peeked into her diary again, nothing about the kiss was written in there. Apparently, my kiss wasn’t something that made her happy. Then I became curious about what would happen if we had sex.

  However, maybe it’s because of how bad I really want to get someone pregnant right now, rather than Eve who is going to be off her period soon, my attention was on Mimon, who is in the middle of the “unsafe days” as they called it on Earth in my past life.

  After work ended at the innovation association, I returned to the villa together with Eve.

  Mimon plans to come to the villa at night after she goes home to get ready first.

  Eve normally has maids of the villa accompany her to work and back. She’s a slave but she gets to be escorted.

  As an elf, she’s like a bag full of kiris gold coins. One could become rich instantly just by kidnapping her.

  Since she can’t use magic due to the magic seal that has been placed on her, she should be relatively easy to kidnap. Also, it’s not completely impossible that she won’t run away by herself, so escorting her prevents that as well.

  I think Eve already knows that she has no way to survive if she runs away from Nyuneri, but it’s just in case.

  The time walking from the association to the villa is a valuable chance to talk with Eve. I am a little excited.

  「Are you reading the books I lent you?」

  「Yes. They are very interesting」

  「Ohh? Which one do you find the most interesting?」

  Even though she was shaking here and there, Eve told me which book she found the most interesting.

  In the past few days, not only was I able to talk to Eve more easily, we seemed to be able to talk about more things compared to before as well.

  When we walk side by side like this, it kind of looks like a date between a young couple.

  Since I couldn’t have fun with Mimon this afternoon, my crotch area instinctively became stiff.

  I feel like pulling Eve to an alleyway to forcefully thrust her and shoot my load in her.

  「…Master?」

  「Ahh, it’s nothing. What were you saying?」

  I was brought back to reality from her voice while I was having fantasies about raping her.

  「I was talking about sometimes there are weird letters in your memos」

  「Weird letters?」

  「Ah…Sorry, I apologize! Not weird letters. Umm, I mean, letters that I have never seen before…」

  Did she think she had put me in a bad mood? Eve apologized like she was about to prostrate on the ground.

  Isn’t she a bit too afraid of me?

  I accepted her apology and then I thought about ways to make her remember those letters. Since she basically just moves her hands in practice right now, it’s probably a good idea to give her some mental exercise.

  After we returned to the villa, I gave Eve a task. She looked like she really didn’t like it, but she did not refuse.

  As I looked forward to Mimon’s arrival, I proceeded to walk to the bath.

 With my cock already hard, I felt like it would be difficult to take off my pants.

Chapter 75: Map of the Continent (1)

This is sudden but here is a map of the continent of Elluo.

I’ve only named the places that often came up in the story so far.

I’ll add more onto the map as the number of places increases in the story.

Chapter 76: Savoring the Tipsy Widowed Mother Employee (½)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  After I finished eating dinner, I was asleep on my bed in my room.

  I wanted to take a short nap, but by the time I came to, the sky had already turned completely dark.

  After Tesh shook me and woke me up, he lowered his head.

  「Young master, I’m sorry to disturb your sleep. Lady Mimon has arrived」

  「Mnnn…」

  I only wanted to take a nap, but it seems that because I had completely fallen into a deep sleep, I feel sluggish.  

  I made the biggest yawn I could as I listened to Tesh. 

  「Lady Mimon has finished taking a bath, what would you like to do?」

  「I’m good, so call her in. Have a shadow on standby for my command as well」

  「Understood」

  There’s no way I’m going to call her here and then tell her to leave because I’m sleepy.

  Even if I really want to sleep, I’ll probably have her accompany me to sleep together. Since Fanny didn’t come to my bedroom lately, I haven’t had any chance to sleep while having skin contact.

  After Tesh left for a little while, the door was opened silently and a black shadow came in. The one wearing the black costume is Eve.

  I intend to have her appreciate my sex scenes from close up today as well.

  A bit after the black-clothed Eve entered the room, the door was knocked on. Judging from the slow rhythm of the knock, I could clearly tell that it was Mimon. 

  I placed the partially consumed grape juice I had in my hand onto the table.

  「Come in」

  After I gave her permission to enter the room, Mimon whispered “Please excuse me” in a quiet voice and entered the room.

  「Ohh?」

  Mimon, who was timidly walking up, was wearing pajamas similar to a bathrobe or nightgown. For some reason, I felt like she would look good with a brandy glass in her hand.

  Her semi-dry, yellow-colored hair that was damp from her bath was slowly dripping down to her chest.

  Maybe it’s due to the fact that she’s been in the bath until a moment ago, there was fresh steam coming from her body.

  「President…Um, please don’t stare at me too much…It’s my first time dressing like this…」

  Mimon said bashfully as she gently placed her hand on her face that became as red as a tomato because of the bath she took.

  This is nice indeed. I understood with my instincts that an adult woman who is flushed after a bath is something that makes me extremely excited.

  This glamorous appearance is so attractive that it made me think that this is why middle-aged men bring women to hot springs to have an affair.

  「Come here」

  I beckoned Mimon over to the sofa I’m sitting on with my hand.

  After Mimon walked over here while blushing, I put my hand on her hips and guided her to sit down beside me.

  「Mimon, you’re really beautiful. Let me take a better look at you」

  「Ahh…No way…President, I’m already so old…」

  「Come on, don’t say that. You’re beautiful. I’m happy that you came today」

  *Chuu*, when I kissed her, she welcomed my tongue just like that without any resistance.

  「Mnmm…*Kiss*…*kiss*……」

  「Mmmchuu…*Fuaa*. I’m not going to let you sleep tonight, okay?」

  That was a line I always wanted to try saying once in my life. Since I couldn’t use it in my past life, I decided to finish that achievement quickly in this life.

  I already let the association know beforehand that Mimon will be taking a day off tomorrow, so she can stay up really late. That’s why we can do it all night.

  「President. Before that, please let me thank you one more time. Really, thank you for what you did for my son」

  Mimon moved back a bit and bowed to me.

  Yesterday, her eldest son was hired by the innovation association through our connection. I secretly watched him work, and he was working earnestly. I saw the goodness of his mother in him.

  「Don’t mind it. If your other kids will work seriously too, I could hire them as well」

  「Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much…」

  Mimon bowed her head down deeply as she held her hands together in front of her chest.

  Since her bathrobe-like pajamas were loose around the chest area, I could see her cleavage from the opening.

  Due to Mimon’s household not having a man supporting the family, not only were they tight on money until she was hired by our association, if things kept going the way they were going, they would have not been able to pay the taxes and even their citizenship would have been in peril. 

  Now, she and her eldest son have both become employees of the association which pays decently, so their lives have become a lot easier. 

  「While we’re at it, I want to know more about you, Mimon. Let’s talk for a bit」

  I picked up the goblet with grape juice that I left on the table in front of the sofa.

  Since I’m still 12 years old, I try not to drink alcohol for the sake of healthy growth.

  「What do you drink, Mimon? What kind of alcohol do you like?」

  I casually tried recommending alcohol. It’s a secret that I’m drinking 100% pure-squeezed grape juice.

  After I named out a few types of alcohol, Mimon said that she wanted some wine. Since it’s natural for girls to drink alcohol as well, she didn’t feel particularly reserved.

  「Shadow. Bring her some wine」

  When I announced that, Eve, who was in the black costume, moved with only rustling sounds of clothes.

  She exited the room while tottering like she was having trouble walking.

  「President, just now… what was…?」

  「That was something like a servant. You don’t need to worry about it. That person is a girl, and she will never tell people about us. Rest assured」

  It’s a secret that her real identity is Eve.

  「I understand」

  As I enjoyed lightly touching Mimon’s body, Eve came back in after she struggled to open the door.

  She placed the decanter she was holding in her left hand and the goblet in her right hand on the table and returned to her standby spot with satisfaction.

  Since Mimon looked like she was going to pour the liquor herself, I signaled for Eve to pour it for her instead.

  「…Isn’t this…expensive?」

  「Don’t worry about it. Here, cheers」

  A metallic sound was made when our goblets touched.

  Mimon looked like she was concerned about the value of the wine for a second, but she immediately stopped thinking about it and emptied her glass. She looks like she can drink.

  「*Haahh*……It’s delicious」

  「Is that so? You can drink as much as you want tonight」

  Mimon smiled and tilted her goblet at Eve who was wearing the black costume.

  As expected, even Eve understood what that meant and quickly filled Mimon’s goblet with wine.

  Mimon thanked Eve briefly and looked at her goblet with a cheerful look.

  「It’s been a long time since I had wine…Although things became a bit easier after I was hired by the association, I worked so hard to make that money, so…」

  As Mimon said that, she brought the goblet to her lips, and then with a sound from her throat, she chugged the cup of wine down in one go.

  The way women drink around here is quite similar to how men drink. Since she was chugging so wildly, she was giving an image that’s completely different from her normally pure and reserved self. She’s a lot like Anna from Nambonan city right now.

  I put my hand on her shoulder and listened to her talk as she started spilling her heart out.

  *Clang*, *clang*, *clang*. Every time Mimon put her goblet on the desk, the wine in the decanter decreased at a frightening rate.

  Since it looked like it was going to be emptied out real soon, I quickly asked Eve to get more wine.

  「Ever since he died…I have been having a really hard time…」

  I drank my grape juice while touching her slightly heated skin.

  Mimon calmly uttered about what kind of trouble she had after her husband passed away. Perhaps it’s because the alcohol is assisting her too, she was more talkative than usual.

  「You’ve worked hard all this time. Let me compliment you on that. You’re a great mother, Mimon」

  「Do you really mean it…?」

  I ran my fingers through her moist hair and touched her slightly sweaty cheek.

  Mimon started to tear up like a little girl. Her purple eyes that reflected the light of the flickering candles were as beautiful as amethysts.

  When I got closer to her because I wanted to take a closer look at those eyes, her eyelids closed.

  「MMnn……」

  As I enjoyed her lips that tasted like wine, I ran my hand on the chest area of her gown and touched her female curves.

  I savored the mind-numbing sensation and loudly sucked on her lips.

  「*Kiss*…*kiss*…Puahh…Ahmmuu…*Kiss*…」

  The moment Mimon started to proactively move her tongue, I ended the kiss and separated my mouth from hers.

  A bridge of saliva formed and dripped on her knees.

  「There’s no need to force yourself to try so hard anymore. You can rely on me when things get tough. I’ll protect you」

  「……President……」

  I feel like I say the same thing to her every time I sleep with her, but I think it’s important that I keep on doing this kind of thing.

  When I asked for her tongue again, our tongues intertwined as if her tongue was crawling all over mine.

  It was just like she was depending on me.

  After we slowly parted our faces from each other, she tried to use her hand to cover up her reddened face. Then, she picked up her goblet from the table and chugged the rest of her cup down.

  「If you say such kind things to me, I…I might get the wrong idea…」

  The way she was giving me sidelong glances was erotic, and the flames of the candles were illuminating her cleavage that was wide open, displaying her sexually promiscuous figure.

Chapter 77: Savoring the Tipsy Widowed Mother Employee (2/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Although the decanter has been emptied three times, Mimon did not get drunk.

  Other than her becoming more talkative and her skin turning red, everything else was pretty much the same.

  Since many people around here can drink a lot, Mimon probably has that kind of genetic make-up too.  

  「*Kiss*…Mm…*Kiss*……」

  I wonder how many times we have repeatedly kissed whenever there is a pause in our conversation.

  At first, we were kissing once every few minutes, but now we’re doing it every minute or so.

  As I took in her wet tongue that was soaked in alcohol, I felt like I was going to get drunk.

  「*Pant*…Jeez, what’s so good about someone like me, president…? You could find a much younger girl if you wanted to, right? I had outlived my husband…and our age difference is as wide as parent and child…」

  Mimon’s chest area of her pajamas was wide open, her breasts up to her nipples were completely in my view.

  The top half of her body was already pretty much naked. Her round, puffed up nipples looked delicious.

  I have been holding off on body contact for a long time, but I’m almost at my limit. I want to have fun with her on the bed.

  「What’s so good about you, you ask?」

  I pressed my index finger on her round nipple and kissed her again.

  She had probably become accustomed to my tongue, so I was gently accepted by her tongue.

「*Suck*…*Pant*, Haven’t I been telling you that there are many good things about you? Besides…」

  I stood up on the spot and showed Mimon the part of my lower body that was erect.

  Due to my greatly inflated meat pole, the pants of my pajamas were stretched out like a tent.

  「You can already tell right away how attracted I am by you when you look at this, right?」

  Mimon’s gaze was wandering everywhere as she tried to avoid looking at my crotch.

  I sat back down on the sofa and put my hand on her lap. Then, like a caterpillar, I crawled towards the area between her legs with my fingers.

  Inside her bathrobe-like pajamas, her private area was completely soaked due to my continuous caressing.

  「Ahhh…President……」

  「See, your body seems to have taken a liking to me too, no? Even with that age difference we have」

  *Kuchu*, *Kuchu*, as my fingers’ movements made those sounds, Mimon’s body twisted as if she didn’t like it.

  Then, I took my fingers out and showed them to her. I slowly moved my index and middle finger that were stuck together like a scissor. 

  The sticky love juice formed a transparent bridge between those fingers.

  「That…That’s not……」

  「There’s no point in even lying. I know that you actually started to like me. Now, why don’t you give me an honest answer over there?」

  I said that and looked over at the bed. Mimon was surprised for a second, and then she stared at the bed and gulped.

  I stood up from the sofa first and lent her a hand. We headed to the bed as we held hands.

  From a third-person point of view, this scene probably only looks like a mother walking her son to bed while holding hands with him. But since we’re going to the bed to have sex, it was quite immoral.

  「Ah, president」

  「Mimon……」

  I pushed her over on the bed and kissed her on the lips as I hung over her.

  The watery kissing sounds and our heavy breathing echoed in the room.

  「*Haahh*, *haaa*, *haaah*…President……」

  The smell of alcohol from the wine she drank tickled my nostrils.

  After I got rid of the sash by her waist that tied her bathrobe-like pajamas together, the front of her pajamas easily opened up.

  I put my hand on her exposed raw breast and enjoyed its softness. 

  「Please finish it quickly……」

  For these last few days, every time I slept with Mimon, she told me to finish quickly.

  Since I also wanted to feel good fast, I would put it in her after enjoying her body to an extent and cum in the blink of an eye due to her wonderful vagina.

  However, I have no intention of finishing quickly tonight.

  「Nope, I’m not going to. I’m thinking of taking my time to get to know you tonight」

  「That’s…We can’t, that’s…」

  「Why not?」

  Mimon did not answer.

  While I enjoyed her body that had been stripped fully naked, I got naked as well.

  My cock that flew out was so erect that it seemed like it was going to sink into my abs. 

  Then, Mimon sat up and put her hand on the base of my penis.

  Her mindset to suck my cock without me even telling her to is wonderful, but I will refrain from having her do that this time.

  「It’s fine. Let’s take it slow today」

  I lay down next to her as if I’m snuggling up to her, and then I indulged in some light kisses with her.

  When I slipped my hands into her private area and gently rubbed her there repeatedly, I could tell clearly that her juice has been gradually flowing out.

  「Mimon, how do you like this?」

  「AHhhhh…Hurry, please finish quickly…end it quickly…」

  I ignored her wishes and continued to stimulate her vagina moderately. Instead of going fast, I decided to increase my caressing at her other areas such as her butt, her breasts, her back, her feet, and her hair.

  As I toyed with her to my heart’s content, she started rubbing her thighs together and her entire body started to shake.

  「*Haah*……*haa*…*haaa*…Oh no…Ah, president…please, finish quickly…if you don’t, I’ll…」

  While she was looking right at me with pleading eyes, I silently refused her with a smile on my face.

  I massaged her big ass so strongly that it would stimulate her up to her anus.

  「AHhhnn ♡ Ah, ahhhh…noo…Please, president…」

  Since Mimon’s face came close to mine, I kissed her as we hugged each other tightly.

  She sandwiched my thigh with both of her legs and she moved her hips like she was grinding her crotch on me.

  「…So? Which feels better? The sex you had with your late husband or the sex you have with me? Which do you like more?」

  「…AHHhhhhh…stop please…Ahhh…AHhhh, ah…」

  I could feel a large amount of Mimon’s sticky love juice smearing on my thigh.

  It’s slimy and it feels good. This means that there’s no way she’s not feeling it.

  「Tell me honestly」

  Until this point, I have been avoiding direct stimulation to her clitoris. I have just been swirling my fingers around there as if I was teasing her.

  I judged that it’s time to attack now and began to caress her clitoris with my fingers.

  「AHhhhhhhh ♡ AHH ♡ AHHHhhh ♡ President, president, AHHHHH ♡ THERE, RIGHT THEREEEE…」

  She closed her legs so strongly that I thought she was going to crush my thigh.

  After seeing that reaction of hers, I paused the caressing of her clitoris for a second and asked her again,

  「Tell me, who makes you feel better? Me or your late husband?」

  「*Haahh*, *haaahhh*, I don’t want to say it… AHH ♡ I don’t want to say it…please, forgive me, please, hurry, put it in quickly and end it…!」

  「I can’t do anything if you don’t tell me who makes you feel better」

  I repeated the same stimulation for her many times to get her to answer.

  Despite the cool autumn night, Mimon continued to sweat profusely from her forehead.

  I don’t know how many times I have asked her already but I continued to ask her the same question while she gasped for air.

  「Me and your late husband, who makes you feel better?」

  「*Haaaah*, *haa*. Ahhhh! It’s you. Sex with you feels better ♡ Ahhhh! Pleaasee. Put it in me ♡」

  With those words, my cock that had softened a little bit instantly became the hardest it could get.

  I quickly changed my position and assumed the missionary position.

  「Mimon, I’m putting it in!」

  「AHHHHHHHHH, HURRY ♡ HURRY!」

  When I began putting it in her drenched vagina, my cock reached the deepest part of her vagina without any resistance.

  「AHHHHHHHH! A-AHHHH ♡ Mmm! *Kiss* ♡ *Kiss* ♡ *Kiss* ♡」

  Stimulated by her moans of ecstasy, I pressed my lips on hers. She then put her arms around the back of my head.

  As I started moving my hips, she spread her legs wide and lifted her hips up slightly.

  「AHHH ♡ AHHHH! AHH! President! Deeper! Deeperrr ♡ Please fuckk me harder! Ahhh ♡ Ahh!」

  Perhaps it’s because her locked up desires were unleashed all at once, lustful requests were rapidly coming out of Mimon’s mouth.

  In order to give her what she wants, I thrusted my hips hard and delivered my cock deep inside of her.  

  「Ah ♡ Ahh ♡ Mmm ♡ Ah! Ah, more! More, deeper! Deeper ♡ Deeperr! 」

  After she started moving her hips like she was going to jump up, Mimon’s appearance with saliva running down her mouth was the definition of lust.  

  Was the excitement of having tipsy sex getting to her? She continued to moan out unintelligibly.

  Every time I pushed my cock to the deepest part, she screamed out in a lewd voice that made me feel good.

  「Ah, ughh, Mi-Mimon! Ahh, I-I’m cumming!」

  Since I could not withstand the way she was using her hips as well, my pleasure went up to the sky in an instant.  

  「I’m going to cum in your deepest place…! Take it all in!」

  「AHHHHHHHhhhHHHHHHhhhH ♡」

  *Spurrt* Spurt* *Spurrt*! Like that, the semen that was waiting for a long time was released with a tremendous force.

  I hugged Mimon’s body as hard as I could to go just a bit deeper. I sucked on her lips as my tongue entangled with her trembling tongue.

  Maybe because she was further stimulated by that, Mimon’s body started to move violently as she pulled onto the bedsheet. 

「MMMMMNNMMMMMM ♡」

  When that painful sounding moan ended, she let go of the bedsheet as if she lost all her power.  

  Her vagina continued to squeeze the remaining semen out of my cock as if it didn’t care about that.

*Drip*, *drip*, *drip*, I could feel my semen dripping inside her.

  「You’re already mine…」

  I didn’t really expect an answer. If anything, I think it just slipped out naturally because of the excitement I felt from “marking” her insides with my cum.  

  「………Yes sir……」

  As a man, her unexpected answer was plenty enough to satisfy my pride.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 78: Mother’s Return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  After Mimon’s strength suddenly gave out, I held her in my arms and fell asleep.

  By the time I came to my senses, birds were chirping and the morning sunlight was coming through the gaps of the half-opened curtains as blades of light.

  As I moved my body, I felt the solidified juices from last night pulling on my skin.

  I looked next to me and saw the fully naked Mimon there sleeping soundly. As I put my face close to hers with the thought of giving her a wake-up kiss in my mind, a terrible stench of alcohol drifted to me so I just left her alone.

  While I was playing with her exposed, defenseless breasts, a voice came from the door’s direction to inform me that the bath was ready.

  Having servants who act without me saying anything is a wonderful thing.

  I told Mimon, who was looking at me with an absentminded look after she opened her eyes at some point, that I’m going to take a bath and got up from the bed. It seems that she will be sleeping for a bit longer.

  Oh, that reminds me. When I glanced at Eve who was on standby as a shadow in the corner of the room, she was asleep while sitting on the floor hugging her knees.

  She probably stayed up too late since I was interacting with Mimon’s body for a long time last night.

  I got close to her quietly and rolled up the black veil that covered her face, then I gave her a good kiss. I took the chance to grope her breasts while I was at it as well.

  Mimon’s soft and mellow breasts are nice, but Eve’s breasts that are full of elasticity and maxed out on youthfulness are also good.

  「Mm……」

  Did I fondle them a little too much? Eve’s face frowned in her sleep.

  I returned her veil back to the way it was and left the room.

  After I had breakfast together with Mimon, I sent someone to escort her home.

  Now then, what should I do today? As I pondered about that, my door was knocked on.

  「Young master. We were informed that Madam will be back at the castle this evening. What would you like us to do?」

  A scout on horseback who had a letter to notify us about mother’s arrival came to the castle of Nyuneri last night.

  According to that letter, it seems that mother had stopped by her family- Earl Evenapis’s home, and the home of Earl Silopea.

  The Silopea family’s territory is south of our territory, and further down south is the territory of the Evenapis family. Our territory is not that close to the Evenapis’ territory but she probably took a detour there since it’s not that far away either.

  Since the house of Qualdense, the house of Silopea, and the house of Evenapis have a good relationship because we’re related by blood, she was able to travel in a straight line without any worries.

  「If mother is coming back, we’ll need to be ready as well. Let’s return to the castle」

  「Understood」

  As a noble, I can’t just lightly greet my mother with “Welcome home, mother~!” when she comes home after so long. We have to make reasonable preparations.

  I decided to return to the castle as soon as possible.

  It was some time before the evening when mother returned. Going by how I felt, I felt like it was around 3 pm, my afternoon snack time.

The way Fanny was walking around back and forth restlessly mixing in with our busy servants was funny. She is probably really happy to see mother.

  I wonder if about 2 hours in Earth terms from my past life had passed since mother arrived at the castle. I was called to the dining hall after everything was ready. 

  Father, mother, me, and Fanny were all having a slightly early dinner. If grandfather was here, the entire Qualdense family would be gathered together, but unfortunately, he is currently building a castle in the westernmost part of our territory.

  「Wilk. You have grown more manly during the period I haven’t seen you」

  Mother looked at me with a warm and snug smile.

  Plumpy abundant breasts, blue hair in the color of the spring sky was hanging down like it was protecting those breasts, and eyes of that same blue color.

  She is in her mid-30s, yet I don’t feel like her beauty has faded.

  「You think so?」

  It would be more accurate to say that the reason my face became slightly red was not that I was blushing from getting complimented by my mother, but rather because I felt flattered as a man when I got complimented by a beauty like her.

   Mother is the image of an older Fanny. Honestly, she has enough charm to get me hard.

  What a blissful time it was in my infant days that I got to suck on this beauty’s tits. Even now I still feel like I want to suck on them.

  I seriously wondered if she would let me do it still if I acted like a cute baby.

  「Yes. I think your face has become quite dignified. I read in the letters that like my deceased brother-in-law, Gardakul, you have grown up with lots of love. I am very pleased」

  I almost spat my drink out.

  I never thought that I would be told in the middle of a family dinner like this that she was happy about her son’s sex life.

  Fanny looked back and forth at me and our mother’s face, seemingly confused about what we’re talking about.

  「Melly, Fanny is here as well, you know?」

  「Oh my, oh my」

  Father pointed out to mother like he also shared the same thoughts as me.

  Mother made a slightly embarrassed expression and then laughed it off.

  Fanny looked a little perplexed since she noticed that she was the only one who couldn’t keep up with the conversation.

  「Oh right, Wilk, come to my room later. I want to talk about something with just the two of us」

  「Mother, I’m coming first, right?」

  「Yes, that’s right. I’ll talk with you first Fanny, and then I will talk to Wilk after」

  Mother looked at Fanny, and then me. And after that, she looked at father in the end.

  It seems that not only with me and Fanny, she also wants to talk to father alone as well. I’m sure she wants to have a talk with him with their bodies too.

  I secretly prayed that they won’t make a child who is going to fight me to be the heir of the Qualdense family.

  After dinner ended, one of my mother’s servants came to get me during the middle of my bath and guided me to a room.

  Inside mother’s room which I haven’t entered in a long time, there was only me, mother, and her servant. For some reason, my heart is racing just a tiny bit.

  When mother told me to sit down by the table, her servant made us some tea as expected.

  As I sipped on the tea, I started the conversation safely with words like “Welcome home” .

  「…Seriously, times are tough in the royal capital right now」

  Along with some sighs, mother talked about the royal capital.

  Since she spent most of this year there, she mixed in complaints of not being able to spend time with us and how tired she was as she spoke.

  「I was told that you won’t be going to the capital anymore for the rest of this year. Fanny was so happy when she heard that, you know?」

  「Oh? What about you, Wilk? Are you not happy to hear that?」

  「There’s no way I wouldn’t be happy. I’m really glad that you came back, mother」

  The royal capital is already in a state of unrest, then there’s also the suspicious activities of the Synod that were mentioned in the letter she sent us not too long ago. Because of that, things seem to be quite tense in the capital.

  Since mother was too worn out from that stuff, she decided to come home to rest as well as to provide her family with the information along the way.

  「I’m glad that I was able to make it back to Nyuneri so quickly…but still, it looks like it’ll be hard to find a proper wife for you in the current situation. You’re already 12, right? You have to quickly find a wonderful lady」

  「I would like to ask for your patience on this matter, mother」

  When I said that, my mother looked a little surprised, then her expression softened up immediately after and started smiling.

  The way her expression kept changing was so like Fanny, it really made me feel that they are mother and daughter.  

  「Oh my? Do you really not have an interest in marriage? Oh that won’t do. You have to properly develop an interest in a noble lady, okay? Your “studies” are for the sake of your future wife」

  I didn’t think that we would be having a sex talk here. What an unexpected landmine. 

  「And you heard what I said, right? I said that you are similar to my deceased brother-in-law Gardakul. Lukes is glad about that as well. He admires Gardakul from the bottom of his heart…」

  My father, Lukes, seems to have really gotten along well with his brother Gardakul.

  「I have never really met brother-in-law Gardakul, but I heard that he was a kind person…」

  「Is he?」

  Regarding my uncle, I only know that he was a manwhore. People around me don’t really talk about him too much.

  I heard that in the past, when some knights were talking about my deceased uncle and reminiscing about him, my grandfather overheard them by chance just suddenly got up and led our army to attack the territories of the empire’s nobles.

  Since then, I haven’t really heard anybody talking about uncle. 

  「…I think you know this as well, Wilk, but Lukes and I…we had a hard time making a child. I always wondered to myself if I was unable to give birth and worried…For a noble lady, the most pitiful thing is to adopt kids after marrying」  

  As a noblewoman, giving birth to a child is their most important job and their greatest pride.

  The number one desire in a wife of noble descent is to connect the two families together by giving birth to a child and leaving descendants. If they can’t do that and have to resort to adoption, the noblewoman’s confidence will be deeply hurt. It’s a disgrace to the level that would make them want to bite off their tongue and die.

  My mother gave birth to me in her mid-20s. For a noble, that’s later than normal.

  To note, it’s not rare for nobles to adopt children.

  Especially for families of knights, due to their frequent adoptions, there are many households of knights that have thin blood connections between their family members. It’s because they value letting the name of their house live on rather than their blood. Of course, if it’s possible, they would leave behind their blood too.

  Of course, there are many cases of big noble families who aren’t families of knights adopting too. If I were to give an example from the people I know, Viscount Galliana, who had taken care of me in Nambonan city, is not blood-related with his son, Deanrish. Deanrish was adopted.

  For nobles nowadays, adopting children to extend their family’s name has become very common. It became so common that there is a shortage of adoption candidates now.

  「Right when I was feeling troubled over that, Lukes said something really kind to me. Afterward, I found out that it was something that his brother often said to his women」

  “It’s okay to not give birth so quickly”. To my mother who was suffering from the pressure of having to give birth, she was overjoyed when father told her that again and again.

  And she was thankful to father’s brother who had taught father that way of thinking.

  With some of that pressure taken off her, mother fell deeper in love with father and she successfully became pregnant after that.

  「…And for you to grow up with a nature similar to brother-in-law Gardakul, I feel like it’s fate and I’m very glad. Moreover, that nature is something you can be proud about as a noble as well」

  This is kind of a serious talk, but it’s kind of strange because in short, she’s happy that I’m boning a lot of commoners.

  Mother glanced at me who was a little perplexed, then she started to talk to me about uncle for the next while, and I learned about how the villa became a sex house.

  It appears that some of the female servants who work at the villa and the castle were originally my uncle’s concubines. Even after my uncle passed away, they continued to work for us because they wanted to assist our family.

  The old lady who had been washing me in the bath was also one of my uncle’s women. That’s a surprise.

  Perhaps the reason why the females have been looking at me with a heartwarming look in their eyes is that they saw my deceased uncle in me.

  After my mother asked for more tea, our topic of conversation changed again back to the royal capital.

  「…I think that there’s going to be a big social event in the spring at the royal capital for sure. You have already started preparing a new set of clothes, right? I should have already sent a message about that」

  「Yes. I contacted a clothing company some time ago. I think it will be ready before spring」

  When it comes to making clothes that nobles wear at social events, it can take up to months.

  If I approached it like buying a suit in Japan, I wouldn’t make it in time at all.

  「Still, a big social gathering in spring, huh? Just what is that about?」

  Mother put the teacup down gently as if she didn’t want to make a sound.

  「I heard that the Grand Duke’s daughter, Princess Olusshian, is going to visit the royal capital in spring next year. Since they need to publicize that the disturbance in the Levios kingdom has calmed, all the nobles of the country are going to be gathered there」

  「That sounds like it’s going to be a big event」

  「Yeah. Wilk, do you know? The Grand Duke’s daughter is still 12 years old. You might have a chance to dance with her at the party. She might invite you to have tea with her as well」

  「I heard from rumors and read in some document that she’s young, but I didn’t think that we’d be the same age」

  「Yes, she’s the same age as you. However, you have to be careful with her. Despite her being adopted, she still belongs to Duke Milendollva…no, Grand Duke Milendollva, the head of the eastern nobles, I should say」

  Mother looked at me with a serious look. We, the Qualdense family who are located at the kingdom’s westernmost parts, have a bad relationship with the nobles of the east.

  Since the house of Silopea and my mother’s family, the Evenapis, also have a bad relationship with nobles from the east, they could be called our common enemy.

  「Yes, mother」

  「I only heard this from a rumor in the royal capital but it seems that Lady Olusshian is a very beautiful young girl…Be careful, okay?」

  「Of course, mother」

  I do know that the word on the street is that the daughter of the grand duke is a beautiful young girl, but I didn’t think that information about how nobles look would be reliable when it comes from commoners.

  However, if the information is coming from my mother who is active in the royal capital’s social circle, it’s probably quite trustworthy. My interest in this girl is suddenly going up.

  Since I didn’t even have sex once today, I got hard imagining what the grand duke’s daughter would look like.

  「If you get tempted by other women, Plume, who is going to be there with you, is going to get angry, you know?」

  「I will be careful」

  That reminded me of something. I didn’t talk to Plume about my attire for the social gathering this time and just decided on the color and the design myself.

  I did send her a letter as a follow-up, but I wonder if she’s mad at me.

  Since my mother went through their territory on her way home, she probably knows what mood she’s in.

  I politely asked her about Plume.

  「Plume was pleased with your concerns. Ehehe」

  When I look at her bright smile, I could tell that she was telling the truth.

  As I thought, “follow-up calls” are important.

  When I put my hand on my chest in relief, my mother slightly lowered her tone,

  「Let me ask you one thing. If you had Plume as your wife, what would you think about it? I need you to answer this honestly, okay? It’s a very important issue. I would like you to not think about things like our territory’s problems and tell me how you would feel as a man」

  Mother said with a kind of serious look on her face. Come to think of it, father asked me about what kind of women I like not too long ago. I wonder if mother is also curious about that so she’s asking me in a roundabout way.

  While marriage between nobles always has something to do with politics, this seems like a love talk between us. I decided to answer her honestly.

  「Plume is a very beautiful woman, I would be glad as a man. We get along as well」

  My mother’s eyes were scanning me as if she was trying to find out what my real feelings were.

  「I see. I see……」

  She smiled from the bottom of her heart.

  「*Sighh*, when I think about my adorable niece, my worries never end. Wilk, thank you for answering honestly. I’m really glad that you have lots of experience with love」

  「Huhh……I see…」

  I don’t know what was on my mother’s mind, but I don’t think she’s going to choose Plume as my wife.

  Because in Plume’s situation, they need the man to marry into their family to take on their family name.

  After we talked for a while, I decided to return to my room after I had three cups of tea.

As I left mother’s room, I looked back and saw her fixing her hair with her mirror. She’s probably going to have a good time with father now.

  Even though thanks to her, I didn’t have sex with anybody for the entire day.

  Since Fanny doesn’t come to my room because she’s in the middle of her period, it looks like I’m going to spend this autumn night longing for a woman’s body. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 79: Whistleblowing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When I woke up in the morning, the great Mt.Erekthion of my lower body was standing tall.

  I’ve been having such powerful morning erections ever since I returned to the city of Nyuneri. It’s at a level beyond the range of a natural morning physiological phenomenon.

  I never thought that one day of no sex would make it this hard.

  Ever since I experienced having sex, I feel like my cock had been growing remarkably.

  If possible, I want to make some good love to Minith, who had arrived at the castle, with my super stiff meat stick, but I obviously can’t be having sex on the very next day after my mother’s arrival before we have breakfast. 

  The maids who were helping me change kept on taking glances at my bulge.

  It was adorable how they were worrying about how to get my stiff cock into my pants.

  At the breakfast table, mother’s face was brimming with energy.

  Father looks worn out somehow. I’m sure that it’s because he was making tons of love to mother. 

  In the end, Fanny did not come to my bedroom last night. It’s probably because she was still on her period. When I take a closer look at her, she looks a bit anemic.

  Our breakfast is a buffet-style breakfast where we sit there and ask to be served whatever we like, so I recommended some dishes that seem to have tons of iron in them to Fanny.

  「Can you tell me your schedule today, Wilk? You’re going to leave for Nambonan soon, right?」

  「Yes, I plan to leave as soon as all the preparation have been made」

  Now that mother has already come back, I will finally be leaving for the city of Nambonan.

  If everything is good in the castle, I plan to head to the association and quickly instruct them on what to do during my absence. 

  「Big brother, how long is that going to take?」

  「I think everything will be ready by the end of today. That’s why I should be leaving the day after tomorrow」

  「I see…」

  Fanny went quiet after her voice faded.

  「Fanny, Wilk won’t be able to leave with peace of mind if you look at him like that, you know? Wilk, you’re going to be back before the year ends, right?」 

  「That’s what I have in mind. I will return after I finish my business there」

  「You hear that, Fanny?」

  「Yes, mother」

  After I was served my after-meal tea, I discussed my trip to Nambonan with my parents.

  Fanny said that she feels bad for grandfather who was all alone building the castle by himself and asked me to take a letter to him.

  It was at that moment, the door of the dining room was opened in a hurry.

  「I apologize deeply for interrupting your meal. A messenger from the headquarters of the military base had come. It appears to be urgent」

  A servant who was short of breath came through the door and entered the dining room after a quick bow.

  「From the military?」

  It was father who asked in return.

  The gentle tone of voice that he had been using until now changed to a voice that had the dignity of the head of a family in an instant.

  「Yes. The messenger is waiting in the castle for you」

  Since it’s a confidential message coming from the military, the details of the message will not be told to servants.

  If father wants to know about it, the fastest way would be to go see the messenger directly.

  「I will go see him immediately. Bring me to him. ……and Wilk, you come as well」

  「Yes father」

  After Father and I came out of the dining room, we went down the hallway with our servant guiding us.

  When we approached the room that the messenger was waiting for us in, another servant who was on standby outside the room swiftly opened the door.

  The soldier who was standing inside the room waiting for us wasn’t wearing the armor of an ordinary soldier, but administrative clothes that are easy to move in.

  Judging from that, I can conclude that he’s the assistant of a commander-class officer.

  Since it’s not normal to send someone of that position as a mere messenger, we could tell that it was an urgent matter.

  After the soldier gave us a military fashion salute, he told us that he’s a vice-captain that deals with administrative affairs.

  Father and I sat on the chairs nearby right away and quickly asked him to brief us on what’s going on.

  「We received information that the Synod church inside the city is planning on some large scale sabotage」  

  The vice-captain messenger gave us the conclusion first.

  Since we sent the servant who guided us here away, there was only me, father, and the vice-captain in this room, but it felt like the room was cramped.

  「Continue」

  Father said in a heavy and serious voice.

  「Yes sir. It happened this morning. A priest from the city came to the military base and told us about the Synod Church’s plan」

  「And that priest is?」

  「We confirmed her identity and we are keeping her in custody right now. She definitely belonged to the Synod church of the city」

  The vice-captain took a small deep breath before he continues,

  「According to that priest, the Synod Church is planning to launch an indiscriminate attack on everyone in Nyuneri. If they realize that their plan has been exposed, they might put it into action quicker. I think this situation calls for immediate action」

  If the Synod church is planning to launch terrorist attacks in the city, we’ll need to take action as soon as possible. 

  Father sighed without trying to hide his irritation.

  「I will go to the headquarters. Get the escorts ready」

  On the evening of the same day, I arrived at the military base’s headquarters building with more guards surrounding me than usual.

  「Young master. Here we are」

  「Yeahh」

  Guided by the soldiers of the headquarters, I entered a room with desks and chairs lined up. The room felt like a room that’s normally used for conferences or something.

  In the center of the room, there was a priest sitting on a chair with both her hands and feet bound by chains. I remember her. 

  She is the busty priest from the Synod Church of Nyuneri, Cynthia.

  I was supposed to accuse her of a false charge in the future to violate her.

  She is wearing the same nun outfit that she was wearing when I saw her the other time, but this time her veil is off and her hair is exposed.

  Her long hair that is long enough to reach her hips is light pink like sakura petals, and her bright red eyes closely resemble cherries.

  「It’s possible that her telling us those things is a part of the Synod Church’s plan. For that reason, we strictly constrained her」

  A soldier said that to me without me even asking. He probably noticed that I was staring at her. From his crisp way of speaking and explaining, I would guess that he’s a soldier who deals with administrative work.

  Certainly, it’s quite possible that they are putting up an act to send us a whistleblower to divert our attention so that they could attack the Nyuneri castle.

  But even if that’s the case, our defenses at the castle have already been solidified since this morning.

  This morning, after we heard from the messenger, I directly ordered the security of the castle to enter a state of high alert.

  I actually wanted to go with father to the headquarters, but I was ordered to remain in the castle to solidify our defenses.  

  If I went to the headquarters with him, the only people left in the castle with magic powers would be mother, Fanny, and a few guards. My father was not comfortable with that so he told me to remain in the castle.

  Once Father and the vice-captain confirmed the situation at the headquarters, he immediately got the army together.

  The swiftly mobilized force of the Qualdense army rushed into the castle town in a blink of an eye and completely surrounded the area of the Synod Church. They got into a formation that not even a mouse could escape.   

  After they confirmed that there are no magic users inside the church, father returned to the castle and passed the baton to me. He seemed like he wanted to wrap things up quickly since he’s busy with some other things.

  By the time I came to the area the army surrounded in place of my father, the commanding officer had already taken control of the church.

  I was told that there was not much resistance from the Synod church as they all surrendered very quickly. We still have the area surrounded to not let anyone escape, but the situation has at least calmed down.

  With that, everything is good and everyone lived happily ever after…would be nice, but things don’t work like that.  

  Therefore, I came to the headquarters to get more intel out of the priest who did the whistleblowing.

  「Now then, let’s have you tell me everything you know in detail. But before that…」

  Her hands and feet that have been chained down since probably this morning were dyed in a painful color that makes me feel bad whenever I look at them.

  As the soldier said, her action could be a diversionary tactic, but if she told us what she did in good faith, this would be a bit cruel.

  「Oi. Take her chains off. She can’t escape this room so easily」

  「But she can use magic…Could I please ask you to at least wait until some more soldiers with magic power come back?」

  Since destroying a building and escaping is not hard for people who could use magic, the soldier’s concern is not unreasonable.

  「Hm? But we can just put a magic seal on her」

  「If there’s a plan of a large scale attack of terrorism like she says, soldiers with magic power are important to our forces. If we use our magic power to put a seal on her then we won’t be able to fight. Because of that, we would only be able to put the smallest seal on her. We will have no idea when that seal would break」

  Magic is something that can be activated by releasing the magic power inside one’s body.

  A magic seal prevents one’s magic power from being released. Since a person’s magic power won’t release if they have a magic seal on them, they would naturally not be able to use magic.

  The method to apply a magic seal on somebody is simple. You just have to get close to the body of the person you want to put the seal on, and then forcefully inject your magic power into them.  

  When a large amount of someone else’s magic power enters their body, their body’s magic power will collide with that person’s and solidify like an invisible wall. Then, they will not be able to unleash any magic power.

  The more magic power you pour into someone, the longer they will have their magic powers sealed.

  In this situation where there might be battles coming up, we can’t afford to waste the unnecessary magic power that would be needed to apply a long duration magic seal on her. It is an appropriate judgment.

  「I see. I will do the magic seal on her then」

  I put a hand on Cynthia’s shoulder. As I felt a female’s softness, I felt my lower half area getting hard.

  Since I didn’t get to thrust my hips the entire day yesterday, I have quite a lot stored up in me. However, there’s no use in attacking her now. 

   I pulled myself together and faced her, and then I poured my magic power into her for a few seconds.

  「Ah?!」

  The amount of magic power commoners possess is nothing much really. If commoners with magic power are cats, nobles would be tigers and lions. The base amount of magic power they have is incomparable to us.

  Especially in my case, on top of me being born a noble, I have been doing magic power training growing up due to me knowing better as a reincarnated person, so I have an insane amount of magic power. I don’t think there’s anybody in this continent I can’t seal off, even if they are nobles.

  「…That was it, huh? As long as I don’t undo her seal, she probably will not be able to use any magic for at least a month」

  If she’s unlucky, she might not be able to break the seal for a few months.

  「I’m sorry to bother you for this」

  「I don’t mind. It’s alright now, right? Unchain her」

  「Yes sir」

  With clanking sounds, the pure black chains that were restraining the girl were removed. 

  I immediately used recovery magic and healed the bruises and lacerations on her skin. Since I plan on having some fun with her in the future, I don’t want her to have any unnecessary injuries. 

  「…Thank you for your generous concerns. May your kind soul receive Lechpotemp’s guidance」  

  Cynthia put her hands together and started to pray. I can feel how much she’s used to praying from the way she moved her hands in front of those huge breasts.

  The way she spoke of the spirit’s name was really like a Synod believer. The spirit Lechpotemp should be a spirit that appears before the weak who are injured or suffering and blesses them with good fortune.

  I raised and lowered my hands and said “Don’t worry about it” to make a good impression on her.

  「You’re Cynthia, a priest of the Synod church, right?」 

  「Yes」

  「There’s something I’d like to ask you again」

 

  「As you please. In the name of Whatenthsāma, I swear that I will not lie」

  I instinctively faltered a little from the pure look in her eyes.

  「…The church leader was not inside of the Synod church of the city. Of course, he was not in the convent either」

  According to the intel Cynthia had given us, the leader of the Synod church of the city was the one responsible for the terrorism plan.

  Even though we believed the intel she gave us this morning and launched a surprise attack at the church, we weren’t able to capture the church leader. The same goes for the other priests that went along with their leader’s terrorism plan.

  After we questioned some believers, we found out that the church leader and his priests were seen leaving the church in a hurry this morning.

  「If you know where the church leader is hiding or if you have an idea of where he could be, tell us」

  Cynthia’s red eyes shut slowly, and then they opened again right after.

  Was she nervous? She slowly took a deep breath. I felt like her abundant breasts were swaying.

  「I think the church leader probably…headed for the field south of Nyuneri」

  She said as she clenched her fists on her lap.

  「The field? Why would he go there?」

  「I don’t know. It’s just that the leader was always concerned about the field. Moreover, he has told the priests in the past that 『There is hope for the Synod church in the field』…」

  According to Cynthia, the church leader had always been close to adventurers who are exploring that field.

  She said that since the royal capital started giving adventurers preferential treatment, the number of adventurers in Nyuneri city has decreased quite a bit, but not a single adventurer that became friends with the church leader had left.

  And the other day, adventurers who were close to the leader came to the Synod church again. Since all of them possessed magic power as well, Cynthia was very shocked. Adventurers who possessed magic power were rare.

  As her story went on, I became a little concerned so I butted in.

  「Do you know the names of those adventurers?」

  「If I’m not remembering wrong, there was one boy, and two girls……It was Mergin, Diana, and Lupetta…」

  The day I went on a date with Minith, I ran into Lupetta at the church. It looks like the church leader had some business with her.

  No, Lupetta seemed like she was there because she was free that day, the one the leader had business with was Mergin or Diana.

  「Miss Diana was like a Synod believer…Ah!」

  While Cynthia was talking, her expression suddenly twitched in surprise and she stared at my face.

  On that day, Cynthia had taught me and Minith about spirits and fables. She probably just remembered my face.

  「And then? What happened?」

  「Ah, right……」

  After I urged her to go on, Cynthia started talking again.

  「And then, Diana and the church leader went into the room in the back to talk. I heard about this later, but it seems that Diana is going to enter the field of Nyuneri for a while. The church leader was happy about that」

  But a few days later, the leader started acting suspicious and he began to panic, she said.

  「The leader was visibly in a state of panic as if he received some kind of bad news. He would be spacing out even when I was talking to him…On the same day he started acting like that, Diana came and they entered the room in the back again」

  It seems that when Cynthia was wondering about what happened, she ran into the two as they came out of the room.

  「At that moment, they both looked pale…so I realized that something bad happened」

  Even after Diana left, the church leader was acting completely bizarre and he sneakily gathered the priests and went into the room.

   Cynthia felt that something was off, so she tried to use magic to eavesdrop on them even though she knew that she shouldn’t do that.

  「Although I was eavesdropping on them, since I have never done anything like that before, I couldn’t catch everything they said. However, I heard that the leader and the others were planning a large scale rebellion」

  Then she told me in detail about what she heard. But it was the same as what she had told the soldiers, there wasn’t really any new intel.

  If I were to summarize it, it was like “The plan seems to have been exposed! If this is true then this is seriously not good! We’re still in preparation but we have no choice but to start the acts of terrorism already!” …that kind of content. There weren’t any details.

  「Then at the end, the leader said “We will obliterate the pride of nobles and regain our faith that had been trampled by politics. In order to do that, we have to sacrifice all we have”…」

  Cynthia tried to convince the church leader to give up on the idea. She told him that she doesn’t know what he’s trying to do, but it’s not going to work.

  However, it did not work. Rather, she was being convinced to assist in the plan as a priest who possessed magic power.

  Cynthia did not give him her reply and thought about it.

  Since the Synod is being persecuted by the Levios kingdom, it’s inevitable they would be unhappy with the kingdom. However, she concluded that it’s unacceptable to drag unrelated citizens into that.

  Moreover, if the plan failed, not only the church leader, the devout priests and believers who had nothing to do with the plan will all be executed.

  As a result of having all kinds of worries, Cynthia gathered her courage and left the convent, then she came to the military base to be a whistleblower.

  I guess when Cynthia went to persuade the church leader is most likely when he made a plan to run away…

  Since the church leader was a commoner with no mana, there is no way that he could defeat Cynthia. Therefore, he could only run.

  「Hm. Some things still don’t make sense」

  「Please, please believe me…」

  「Even if I believe you, we don’t know where the leader went. Since the plan is also about an indiscriminate attack, I don’t get it」

  “I think he went to the field” doesn’t give us much of a clue at all.

  In the first place, the church leader who can’t even use magic can’t do much even if he wants to do any big scale indiscriminate attacks.

  「We should stay on alert in the city for a while as we continue the search inside of the church. We might find some information related to this plan」

  The soldier spoke as if he couldn’t stand seeing me and Cynthia who went silent.

  「Yeah…Priest Cynthia. I’m sorry but you will have to be detained here for a while. We can’t release you until the plan of the church leader becomes clear. Okay?」

  「I am fully aware」

  「If you’re cooperative, you will definitely not be treated badly by the soldiers here」

  「Thank you. As long as I can prove the innocence of the people other than the church leader and his priests, I will do anything to cooperate」

  Then I’ll have you cooperate with me a little on the bed- The moment I had that thought in my mind, a soldier came running in the room. Man, today is such a busy day.

  「Captain! So here you are!」

  「What’s the matter?」

  While taking deep breaths, that soldier spoke with a tense expression.

  「We caught two rock salt stealing adventurers at the outer city gate! A child adventurer named Lupetta is making a commotion about wanting to speak with you! The male adventurer is in very bad condition, and there are 8 babies who are also in a really weakened state! Captain, please give me your orders!」  

  「Lupetta?」

  The content of his story was unclear, but he seems to have been told to run here with just that message first.

  I think the male adventurer is probably Mergin. However, I don’t know who the 8 babies are and why Mergin and Lupetta were stealing rock salt.

  It’s been a little over a week since Lupetta left for the field. Something probably happened during this time I haven’t seen her in.

  There’s no way she got pregnant with 8 babies from having sex with me, so she started stealing the Nyuneri specialty rock salts because she needed money after she gave birth to them in just a week, and Mergin is all messed up from the stress of taking care of the 8 babies, right?

  The soldier who brought me the message waited for my reply as he kept his posture straight.

  I judged that I won’t be able to get any more useful information out of Cynthia even if I stay here, so I opened my mouth. 

「I will go to the outer city gate. Lead the way」

「Yes sir!」
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 80: Inside the Fog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  As the dry autumn wind caressed my skin, I advanced on a horse.

  I am on my way to the outer city gate under the pretense of tracking the church leader’s trails as he supposedly fled to the field. 

  If I just thoughtlessly went there to answer Lupetta’s call when she’s a commoner, my dignity as a noble would be lost.

  The outer city gate where Lupetta got caught refers to the city gate that’s at the outermost walls of the city of Nyuneri.  

  The outer walls which are designed like a worse copy of The Great Wall of China surrounds the entire city of Nyuneri. There are a total of 5 gates, one in east, south, west, north, and in the northwest where there is a lot of traffic.  

  Lupetta is at the southern one.

  Since the outer city gate is quite far from the military base, I am going there on horseback.

  As I turned to my right, I could see the setting sun painting the plains in a beautiful red. If I don’t get back quickly, the lands would be repainted the color of the night in no time.

  When I arrived at the outer city gate, a few soldiers from the rampart came up to me.

  I followed them on my horse as they guided me to the station of the gatekeepers.

  「Young master. Please be careful about the Synod church. We are outside of the city’s wide-area detection range」 

  「Yeahh」

  My escorts were not enthusiastic about me coming here. It was because of the possibility that an assassin is using the name of Lupetta as a trap.

  There is little danger to wander in the castle town. That is because there is a magic circle set up in the city that targets everyone in the entire city and detects people who have magic power.

  A support magic circle for wide-area detection has been active the entire time since this morning to prepare for any terrorist attacks from the Synod church. Suspicious people will be captured in real-time and immediately put under arrest/into custody.

  However, the range of that wide-area detection magic only covers the entire city area, not the entirety of the city of Nyuneri.

  The “entire city area” is mainly the area of the Nyuneri castle and the castle town. The zones outside of those areas are not within the detection range.

 

  After the soldier of the station opened the door, one of my escorts went inside first.

  Another one of my escorts stretched his arm out in front of my chest like a railroad crossing bar to stop me from walking. They were probably worried about a possible ambush by an enemy, but it’s such a pain in the ass.

  3 of my escorts walked in front of me to lead the way, and there were multiple guards behind me and on my sides. I truly am a noble’s son.

  We walked down a hallway that smelled a bit dusty and entered a small room.

  「Mr.Captain!」

  When my escorts saw Lupetta quickly rushing over to me, they immediately put their hands on the swords that are hanging on their waists. 

  This isn’t good, I thought. Without speaking, I quickly put my palm out towards Lupetta to indicate her to stop.

  Maybe Lupetta came to realize the current situation from that, so she stopped moving with a startled expression on her face and quickly kneeled with her fingers on the floor. 

  「It’s you, Lupetta」

  「Yes」

  I said Lupetta’s name to let the guards know that she isn’t an imposter. The guards have seen Lupetta several times before, but I did it just in case.

  After my escorts saw her obediently continuing to kneel, they took their hands off their swords. 

  「It looks like you have gotten arrested again…」

  In the middle of my sentence, Lupetta changed from the kneeling stance to sitting on her knees.

  As I took a better look at her, I saw that her body was completely dirty, probably due to the fact that she’s been in the field for about a week.

  「Mr.Captain! Please introduce a healer to me! Mergin…Mergin is going to die! So…!」

  「Huh?」

  When I looked at the corner of the room, Mergin was lying there on a bed.

  At first glance, I thought it was a corpse, but since his body was slightly moving from him breathing, I guess he’s still alive.

  His clothes were ripped everywhere, and I could see dried black and red blood underneath. The messed up flesh on his arm and his dark-colored feet and shoulders are indeed pitiful. It’s so grotesque that just from looking at it makes my skin crawl. 

  He’s in such a bad state that Lupetta has no choice but to ask me to get him a healer.

  If he were just an ordinary commoner, he would have probably died long ago. Since humans with magic power are much tougher than normal humans, he’s still alive in that kind of condition.

  Humans who can use healing/recovery magic are called healers, but there are not many commoners with magic power who can use healing magic.

  And since those rare healers are hired with high salaries and given preferential treatment by nobles and armies for their exclusive use, there are very few healers out there who would stay “free” to heal commoners.

  In the case of dedicated military healers, they would be busy when there’s a war but they would have free time when times are peaceful. Since it would be a waste of taxes to have those highly paid healers just doing nothing, many places have their military healing centers provide healing services to commoners. It does cost money everywhere though.

  Since healing magic is very popular, there are lots of people waiting in line on the days those healing centers are open. That is where connections with the army become important. If you have connections to the army, you can get to the front of the line.

  If you belong to the upper echelon of the army, you could also ask the healers to heal you even on days when the healing center is not open depending on the situation.  

  The reason Lupetta asked me is probably that she thinks I’m a big shot in the army.

  「Insolent little girl! You think he’s someone you can just talk to like that?! Know your place!」

  The soldiers at the gate complained about the way Lupetta spoke to me.

  Lupetta’s shoulders trembled, and then she prostrated herself with tears in her eyes and apologized.

  This isn’t the bedroom of the villa. This is a public place.

  I can’t listen to her with her attitude just now. That’s because of my position as a noble.

  If people see me talk on even terms with a commoner in public, it might hurt my reputation as the next heir.

  I want to have an easy, comfortable life in the future, so I absolutely want to inherit the position of the head of the family from my father.  

  「…I’ll forgive you this time. However, there won’t be a next」

  Good thing Lupetta immediately corrected her attitude and apologized to me. Thanks to that, it allowed me to take a position of “I’ll forgive her because I am generous”.

  If Lupetta made a fuss to fight back against the soldiers, she might have died before Mergin does. It’s important for a commoner to have that kind of attitude when dealing with a noble/lord.

  I like Lupetta, so I don’t want her to die in such a stupid way.

  I noticed that Lupetta can’t make up her mind about how to not be rude when speaking.

  Since the city of Nyuneri doesn’t just have healers for exclusive military use, but healers who sell their service to commoners as well, it’s not hard to introduce one to her.

  However, I can’t just give someone who was rude to me what they want even though she apologized. In the first place, she is a rock salt thief suspect, so I have to deal with that before we can even talk about the healers.

  For the time being, I decided to begin with a conversation.

  「That guy possesses magic power, right? A magic beast did that to him? He seems awfully injured」

  「No…That’s not it」

  「Then what were you guys attacked by?」

  I already had an idea in my mind while I was asking her that question. 

  Other than magic beasts, an existence that could harm a human who possesses magic power has to be another human who possesses magic power as well.

  But Lupetta answered me with something that exceeded my expectations.

  「…We were attacked by a noble of the Synod church in the field」

  I felt like the sound of people gulping echoed in the room. It was only natural since we have been searching for terrorists of the Synod church since this morning.

  When I looked over at my escorts, they told the soldiers of the gate to get out of the room as if they understood what I wanted to say.

  Important information about the Synod church’s plans might come out here, so we cannot let ordinary soldiers know about it.

  The room that I, Lupetta, and my escorts were in was engulfed in a tense atmosphere.

  「Lupetta. Tell me more about it. When were you attacked by the human from the Synod church? What do you mean by a noble of the Synod church? Was that person a high priest from St.Navenpos?」

  「I’ll tell you. So please, Mr.Captain. I beg you…! I’ll do anything. Please help Mergin, please help him……Mergin fought against the Synod church’s noble and became this injured…! You’re the only one I can rely on in Nyuneri…I don’t want Mergin to die…Please……! I beg you…!」

  Lupetta spilled several large drops of tears on the floor like a child as she begged.

  Rather than forcing answers out of her like this, it seems better to heal Mergin first. I started to think about an excuse to heal him.

「It seems that this guy had fought against the noble of the Synod church or whatever. We need to find out more information from him. He looks like he’s going to die soon, so give him some light treatment」

  「Yes sir!」

  It might have been a bit of a stretch, but I decided to classify Mergin as a person of interest to give him treatment.

  After I gave my orders, one of my escorts applied some light healing magic on him. Since healing magic uses a fair amount of magic power, I couldn’t order them to completely heal Mergin. Their magic power is there to protect me.

  Then, that escort called the soldiers of the gate outside of the room and ordered them to move Mergin to the military base. Since there are military healers at the base, he could get proper treatment there.

  「WAHHHHHhhhHHHh…Mergin, Mergin……! Mr.Captain…Thank you, thank you…」

  Lupetta thanked me, the escort who used healing magic, and the soldiers who were carrying Mergin on a stretcher with her hands on the floor.

  I don’t care whether Mergin lives or dies, but I think Lupetta would hate me if I abandoned him. Therefore, I won’t let him die since I want to have an enjoyable sex life with Lupetta.

  「That guy is going to be fine now. Take a seat and let’s continue our talk. Just what exactly happened inside the field?」

  I faced Lupetta after she regained her composure and sat down on the other side of the desk.

  She kept on telling me that they were attacked by a noble of the Synod church, but I don’t understand what happened before and after at all.

  「I need to know more. Start from after you guys entered the field」

  「Understood」

  Lupetta began to tell the story with a respectful tone.

  She entered the field with Mergin and 4 other adventurers who had recently joined their party as a party of 6. They were the same people who were arrested in Nyuneri some time ago.

  Lupetta and the others planned to wander in the field however they liked and if they came across any magic beasts, they would just beat the crap out of them.

  Since the army of Qualdense had been carrying out expeditions to hunt magic beasts in that field several times a year, there aren’t any magic beasts that are grown enough to leave the field.

  At the field of the royal capital, I heard that there are only immature scrub magic beasts left as a result of hunting because of the adventurer fever there, but in the field of Nyuneri, there are still magic beasts that would give commoners who don’t possess magic power a bit of a hard time.

  Lupetta said that they strolled around inside the field while they hunted magic beasts here and there as they continued their adventure smoothly without running into much trouble.

  The incident happened after they arrived at the area where rock salt could be harvested and went deeper into the field.

  There is a girl called Diana in their group of 6. She’s the source of Lupetta’s stress and she’s “that girl” who Lupetta often complained to me about on the bed at the villa.

  After they passed the rock salt area, Lupetta felt that Diana had been deceitfully controlling where they were going with her words.

  When she somehow became worried about that, Diana snuck out of their camp that night. They had a system where they take turns as night lookouts, and Diana seems to have left at a time when Lupetta and Mergin were supposed to be asleep.

  Their companions who were on watch sent Diana out like they had planned it ahead of time. Lupetta followed her secretly since she had been kind of suspicious about those four people’s actions after they entered the field. 

  Since their camping site was in an area that has huge boulders scattered everywhere, Diana remained cautious of her surroundings as she checked on some kind of note in her hand while she proceeded on a trackless path.

After Lupetta walked for a while, she found a cabin that was hidden between boulders.

  She was super surprised at the fact that there are man-made structures that deep into the field.

  But contrary to Lupetta’s reactions, Diana entered that small house with zero hesitation.

  Lupetta sneaked up to the cabin and tried to use magic to eavesdrop inside. Then, she heard the conversation that was going on inside there. Other than Diana, there seemed to be two men there.

  Diana said disturbing things one after another.

  The conversation between Diana and the men in the cabin used a lot of names of spirits as jargon so she could not quite understand the details. But there was one thing that Lupetta was sure that she heard.

  And that is the dangerous content that Diana and the 3 others will launch a surprise attack on her and Mergin and kill them. When Lupetta thought of being attacked by the four of them who she thought were her friends, her heartbeat rose.  

  Right when she thought of hearing more about their plan in detail, the cries of a baby suddenly came from inside the cabin. Then, several crying voices of babies echoed as if they were drawn in by the first one.

  Lupetta felt horribly spooked to find out that there are babies in the dangerous environment known as a field.

  After she became terrified of the babies’ cries, she fled the scene to tell Mergin about it.

  After she returned to their camp, Lupetta woke Mergin up from his sleep and explained the situation to him.

  Mergin did not believe what she was saying at first, but since he immediately noticed that something was off about Lupetta, he listened to her seriously.  

  The conclusion of their discussion was that a 4 vs 2 would be bad for them after all, so they decided to just lead the party to leave the field in a way that won’t blow their covers.

  So the next day, Mergin suggested to Diana and the others to go back to the city of Nyuneri.

  That was when Diana pulled her sword on Mergin without hesitation and attacked him. When Lupetta tried to protect Mergin, the remaining 3 adventurers turned their blades to her.

  However, since Mergin was ready for that, he flung Diana’s sword away. Then he brought Lupetta’s rough 1v3 battle to a 2v3.

  After Diana picked her sword that flew away back up, she rejoined the battle. In the end, the 2v4 battle Lupetta feared began in full swing.

  In terms of strength of the 6, Mergin was the strongest, then it’s Lupetta and Diana, then the remaining 3 is a step further down.

  Thanks to that, they were able to hold their ground even in a 2v4.

  It was when they really believed that they could make it through like that-

  There was a man slowly walking towards them as if he was taking a stroll in the dangerous field.

  He had no weapons in his hands and he was wearing the religious garment of the Synod church. Lupetta felt an unspeakable fear after she saw him.

  When that mysterious man saw that Diana and the others were at a disadvantage, he activated a spell from a spot far away that was hazy from the fog.

  By the time Lupetta noticed that a countless number of ice spears had suddenly appeared in the sky, the spears were released at them at lightning speed.

  Mergin, who then shielded Lupetta right away, ended up with his legs and shoulders pierced. Since he became immobilized with the spears of ice piercing him, he could not dodge the slashing attacks coming from the four adventurers and got hit by their blades.

  Lupetta was horrified. That was because she saw a glimpse of the man’s overwhelming amount of magic power when he activated that spell.

  If they were up against someone who possesses noble-class magic power, they were as good as dead, she thought. There’s no way they could win against noble-class spells.

  The mysterious man then released his magic power to intimidate them as if he was revealing the answer to her for her to see if she guessed right.

  Before the man’s extraordinary amount of magic power and his murderous intent, Lupetta dropped the sword and spear she was holding in her hands and just stood there.

  As she suppressed her body from shaking, she asked Diana.  

  Why are they attacking her? What was that cabin? Who is that man with the enormous amount of magic power? And what the hell are they planning and such…? Lupetta yelled in order to scare away her fear and keep her consciousness that felt like it was sinking into darkness.

  Diana was a bit surprised when she learned that she didn’t notice at all that Lupetta had followed her. Then, she immediately made an evil smile and opened her mouth. As if she was rehearsing a line out of a play, she said to her slowly, “You guys will be sacrificed along with those babies. Everything is to end the oppression of the foolish nobles who ignores the voices of the saints”.

  Lupetta was heartbroken as her shoulders sagged. Then just when she wondered if there was anything she could do, she unconsciously reached into her pockets and realized something. 

  In her pocket, there was the charm I gave her as a parting gift on the day she departed. She grabbed the charm as her last hope.

  「Did you use it?」

  「Mmhm…yeah, I used it」

  I made a charm like the ones I could buy at the Shinto shrines in Japan from my past life and gave it to Lupetta. I had put a manalal crystal inside that charm. Of the 3 manalal crystals I got from Nambonan city, one was turned into an arrow, and one was turned into a charm for Lupetta. 

  The manalal crystal I gave to her contained the super-noble-class magic power I would have in one of my spells. I had taught her how to activate the crystal before she left just in case.

  Even if she had taken the crystal and ran away with it, I would just call it even for all the sex she had with me. Moreover, the magic power that’s stored in there would disappear over time anyway.

  In order to make it through that situation, she took the manalal crystal out of the charm, released the magic power, and unleashed a spell at the mysterious man’s direction.

  The spell she used was a water spell. Lupetta said that she was always good with spells that created water from nothing. Under the extremely tense atmosphere, she seemed to have unconsciously cast the spell that she was most used to casting.

  Since the amount of magic power that was stored in the manalal crystal was so enormous, her spell was strengthened to an unimaginable degree.

  Caught completely off guard, the water spell quickly reached the mysterious man and the lower half of his body was completely blown off from the excessive force.

  Diana and the others probably didn’t expect that the mysterious man would lose, so they were all stunned. When Lupetta saw that opening, she took that chance and slashed them down.

  With her enemies neutralized for the time being, Lupetta decided to tend to Mergin. As she started to pull the ice spears out of Mergin, another man appeared. She was anxious as she did not know what to do if another enemy who could use magic appeared, but that man just screamed frantically and tried to run away.

  She was convinced that she would be able to win since the man was running from her, so she dashed up to him and slashed him from the back.

  She was relieved for good at that time, so she tried to treat Mergin with the simple treatment tools they brought, but it wasn’t enough.

  She wondered if there was anything else she could use to treat him, and then with Mergin on her back, she decided to head to the cabin she went to last night.

  She thought that there probably won’t be anyone else there at that time.

  The cabin had enough space for people to live in and there was plenty of food stored there. Fortunately, there were some treatment tools as well, so Lupetta decided to gladly make use of them.

  Although she applied basic first aid to Mergin, such amateur first aid would only be able to prolong his life for a bit, she could tell that Mergin would eventually die at that rate.

  She knew that she had to return to the city of Nyuneri as soon as she could to find a healer, but there was one more problem that she noticed.

  That was the babies in the cabin.

  According to what Diana said to her, there was a high chance that those babies were going to get killed too. Maybe Diana had other allies that were going to go to the cabin later. If that’s the case, she had no idea what would happen to them.

  Even if Diana’s other allies don’t show up, it’s obvious what would happen to the babies if they were just left there. Lupetta could not ignore them.

  She packed all those 8 babies into a big backpack and wore the backpack in front of her chest. And with Mergin on her back, she began to walk back to the city of Nyuneri in tottering steps.

  When she approached the rock salt area, there were carts parked around with the purpose of storing rock salt inside. Since there were several empty carts lined up next to each other, she concluded that the salt vendors were storing the carts there.

  After Lupetta saw that the babies were getting weaker and how there was no way she could fend off magic beast attacks with them in front of her chest and Mergin on her back, she decided to borrow a cart without permission.

  She put Mergin and the babies side by side in a cart and kept on going single-mindedly afterward.

  Then, when she saw the outer city gate of Nyuneri and thought that she was finally saved, she got arrested by the gate’s soldiers.

  The soldiers were suspicious about her because they did not recognize her face even though they often saw the faces of the rock salt collectors.

  Thus, Lupetta was treated as a rock salt thief and arrested.

  「I see. I got the gist of it now」

  「*Haahh*……」

  Lupetta sighed with a relieved look.

  「Young master, may I speak for a second?」

  「Alright」

  One of my escorts whispered to me while covering his mouth. He probably had something he wanted to check after he heard Lupetta’s story.

  After I gave him my permission, he looked at Lupetta.

  「The adventurer that attacked you guys, her name was Diana, right? Did you finish her off?」

  「I did not」

  According to Lupetta, she cut the leg tendons of Diana and the others with her sword, so they could not move anymore. They should be dead from the leeches that appear in the field by now.

  「The man in the religious garment that you said was a noble, you said he had as much magic power as a noble, right?」

  「Yes」

  「You said that the lower half of his body got blown off, but did you cut off his head?」

  「I did not」

  The mysterious man who took a hit of my magic power literally got the lower half of his body blown off. She said that he was having his last moments with just his upper body remaining. It was quite a gross scene.

  「That’s why I think he’s already dead…」

  Lupetta said that, but if that man really has noble-class magic power, her prediction would not be correct.

  When I turned to look at my guards, one of them opened his mouth.

  「Young master, if that man has as much magic power as this little girl says, it’s quite possible that he would still be alive. It would be best if we send the army in to make sure that he’s dead」

  「Yeah」

  「Huh…? But, everything below his stomach was gone…」

  Lupetta was confused, but that’s how it is. When you have as much magic power as a noble, you won’t die so easily. Upper body aside, if it’s just his lower body that was blown off, he could probably survive until he’s starved to death.

  Mergin, a commoner who looks like he has fatal injury, was still alive after more than a day on a cart. If it’s a noble, they would be able to last much longer. 

  Since the mysterious man obviously can’t move when he has no legs, he would probably be groaning at the same place. 

  「I want you to go with the army and guide them to the spot, Lupetta」

  Cynthia’s testimony also confirmed that Diana was connected to the church leader. I’m also concerned about the mysterious man’s real identity.

  Mergin and Lupetta who were attacked, the cabin in the field that people could live in, a mysterious man who possesses noble-class magic power, 8 babies, the plan of the church leader, and what the church leader and Diana were after. In the end, how are all those things connected? 

  Lupetta and my guards probably all noticed that I was in deep thought, so they refrained from talking and the room became quiet.

  「Hm?」

  「…Young master」

  *Donng*, *dongg*, I could hear the sounds of bells coming from the distance. The bell of the castle town that rings to tell time should make high pitched clanging noises.

  The bell sounds I could faintly hear right now is a low-pitch sound that is similar to the night bells I could hear in Japan from my past life.

  That bell sound could only mean one thing.

  「Young master, it’s the sound of the alarm bell」

  「Yeah, I can hear it」

  It was the alarm that warns people that a magic beast had appeared.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 81: Magic Beast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Throughout Earth’s history, the ruling class known as nobility existed around the world. 

  Just what the heck was their source of authority? After I was reincarnated as a noble’s heir, I often thought about the nobles of Earth from my past life. 

  Was it their individual leadership? The people’s faith they had backing them due to religions? The family history they have as rulers? There are probably many answers to that question.

  After living 12 years since I was reincarnated on the Elluo continent, I now think that their authority was very unstable.

  Nobles on Earth were the same as normal people if you strip them of their clothes. Just because they were nobles, it didn’t mean that they are another species that bleeds blue like horseshoe crabs. All humans were equal. Commoners and nobles were the same homosapiens.

  In the end, it seemed to me that their source of authority was the tautology of “they are great because they are”. When I think about the history of nobility being overthrown by the people, their authority was something that was easily destroyed with one wrong move.

  In the Elluo continent, the source of the nobles’ authority is very simple.

  Nobles are great because they are strong. It’s very easy to understand.

  We almost never get sick, we have a strong and resilient body, and we can freely control powerful magic.

  Those powers that could already label us as a different species compared to commoners are what makes nobles nobles.

  Throughout the history of the Elluo continent, there is also a history of battles between humans and magic beasts.

  Magic beasts which indiscriminately attack humans and bring disaster to the lands could also be called a type of natural calamity. In order to protect themselves from those natural calamities, people followed the humans who possessed strong magic power and came under their rule.

  In other words, battling with magic beasts and taking them down is both a noble’s duty and their pride.

  If there will ever be a time when the authority of nobles will waver, it would probably be when civilization is developed enough for commoners to repel full-grown magic beasts by themselves. At the very least, I don’t think that will happen in this era I’m alive in. Therefore, I can play with commoners in bed without worries.

  A noble must not run away from magic beasts.

  After a magic beast is born in a field, they live in a world where the strong devours the weak, and they grow up while they repeatedly fight to the death with other magic beasts. 

  They jump out of the fields when they are completely grown up, bringing disasters to humanity.

  A fully grown magic beast (mature magic beast) brings all kinds of catastrophes with them. Just from them walking around alone, the ground withers and rivers rot. They often spread unknown plagues and strange diseases, and if they are left alone, they will destroy the humans’ living environment in the blink of an eye.  

 

  How strong a mature magic beast is depends on the size of the field it grew up in. The larger the field is the longer it’ll take for a magic beast to grow up, and the more vicious it will be once matured. The field of Nyuneri is one of the larger fields in the Levios kingdom. A magic beast that has matured enough to leave that field will become a considerable threat. If it doesn’t get dealt with, the entire area around the city of Nyuneri will most likely receive devastating damage.

  「Young master, I have received a letter from the lord」

  「Good work」

  I accepted the letter from Tesh and placed it on the desk.

  When I was about to open the letter, Tesh continued to speak with a trembling voice, seemingly touched.

  「The lord was very pleased when he heard about the magic beast subjugation, young master. He said that you did the Qualdense family proud as the heir…」

  After I learned that a magic beast had appeared when I was at the outer city gate, I quickly returned to the military base.

  The sound of the alarm bell came from the front-line base that’s located in front of the field. There was enough time for me to rally the troops.

  By the time I arrived at the base, the soldiers there were all organized and ready to go on my command.

  A battle with a mature magic beast is also a battle against time. Because of that, I was granted the authority to act without consulting my father when it comes to magic beast subjugations. This is the same for grandfather or mother.  

  If we can’t defend the citizens of our territory from magic beasts, it would affect our dignity as nobles.

  Right after I led the army past the southern city gate, the mature magic beast showed up at the perfect timing. 

  If I am to give a comparison to its appearance, it was a turtle about the size of 2 common convenience stores from Japan in my past life stacked on top of each other.

  Mature magic beasts are generally pretty big, but their size is based on their types. That massive turtle was a mature magic beast that would belong in the small category if anything.

  When I looked at the ground, I saw that the magic beast’s tracks were dyed purple as the ground became contaminated.

  Judging from its tracks, it looked like the beast was heading straight north. It probably sensed that there were a lot of humans in that direction with its nose or something.

  I deployed the army and had them surround the magic beast. Then, I had the soldiers draw its attention with their ticklish arrows and spear attacks as I watched for the right timing to hit it hard with my magic. 

  After I struck it 2 times with everything I got, the massive magic beast was no longer moving and the subjugation was a success.

  Although there were a few soldiers with minor to serious injuries, there were luckily 0 casualties. It was unusual considering a mature magic beast of that size had appeared. I was told that there were many more injured people at the front-line base located in front of the field.

  Also, I don’t know if it’s because mature magic beasts hate the field they were born in, but once they come out of a field, they will never go back again. The soldiers of the front-line base seemed to have managed to escape death by evacuating into the field when they got injured.

 

  By the time we defeated the magic beast and everything was settled, it was really late at night. If I was in Japan in my past life, the sun would probably have come back up a long time ago.

  After I made sure that the magic beast was completely dead, I went to the villa at the castle town and just went to sleep there instead of returning to the castle.

  I was planning on getting a good night of rest but when I woke up, the sun had yet to rise. 

  It seems that staying up too late at night made me not able to sleep well instead. The excitement from battle might still be lingering on me.

  Since I was wide awake for some reason, I took a bath and had breakfast before I returned to my room to relax.

  I left the cleaning up of the magic beast subjugation to the commanding officers of the army, so I did not have anything to do anymore.

  「Hmm」

  As I read my father’s letter, I received lines filled with generous compliments from him. That’s because defeating mature magic beasts is the highest honor for a noble.

  I had informed him about the story Lupetta told me before I slept, and it seems that my father decided that it was an important matter. In the letter, he said that he had decided to send the army into the field. They planned to depart from the military base of Nyuneri at noon. They will also check to see if there are any other magic beasts there that are about to mature while they are there.

  Father also instructed me to make Lupetta go with the army. It’s a cheap price for her to pay considering how she’s not going to be punished for stealing the cart and how we healed Mergin for her.

  「Tesh. Go get Lupetta right away. It’s my father’s instruction」

  「Understood」

  After Tesh passed my word to a servant outside of the room, I heard the sound of running footsteps. My order is probably being carried out right away.

  I decided to write a letter back to my father. It’s so annoying to talk via letters for every little thing.

  Mature magic beasts can sometimes spread strange, incurable, or infectious diseases. There are some terrifying diseases that could infect even nobles.

  Since I fought a mature beast right before my eyes, it’s possible that I have caught one of those diseases. For that reason, I didn’t go back to the Nyuneri castle and decided to spend my night at the villa.

  If I was indeed infected, I could spread it to my parents and even Fanny. I have to avoid that at all costs. Even though I have a proven record of curing nasty, strange diseases with my powerful healing magic in the past, I did not want to take any chances. 

  That is why I could only talk to father via letters since I can’t directly talk to him in person.

  「*Haa*……」

  I wrote in the letter that I can’t go back to the castle for a while considering the possible incubation period, and I will just leave for Nambonan city like this.

  Since the only people who are busy due to the terrorism plan of the Synod church are the people in the army and everything else remained the same as usual, all the preparations I needed for departure were completed

  In father’s letter, he said that “I will reward you for subjugating the magic beast! You can ask me for anything!!”, so I wrote a request back to him just in case. 

  I wrote that if he decides to execute the Synod church’s priest Cynthia, I would like him to hold on that decision until I come back to the city of Nyuneri. After the Synod church’s plan comes to light, it’s possible that Cynthia will be executed as well due to the fact that she’s a priest of the Synod church. I told him that I would like to not see her dead when I come back from Nambonan city.

  I want to do it with her at least once before she’s executed.

  After I finished writing the letter, I handed it to Tesh. I decided to have my letter delivered to my father immediately because there are many important things in there that he needs to read.

  I will take my time to write other letters to mother and Fanny tonight.

  Since I remained in pretty much the same pose writing the letter the whole time, I tried to move around a bit. That was when I realized that a part of my lower half was bulging. 

  My cock is hard because I have morning wood. I didn’t sleep with anyone yesterday or the day before yesterday. I have been abstinent for 2 days. 

  An agonizing lust had been brewing in my heart.

  Then, my door was knocked on and a servant came in.

  「Young master. Lady Lupetta has arrived, what would you like to do?」

  「That was quick」

  「It’s because I was told that the matter is urgent」

  The figure of Lupetta being woken up by a servant at the inn surface in my head.

  Since the army departs at noon, I told my father in the letter that I would bring Lupetta to the military base in time by then.

  It’s still early right now so there is tons of time until then.

  Come to think of it, yesterday Lupetta said that “She’ll do anything”. She’s the one who said it, so I’ll have her do just that.

  Since I didn’t have anything to do anymore, it was perfect.

  「Okay. Bring her in」

  「Understood」

  After I said that, the servant left the room. Tesh also left to prepare the bath.

  As I remained alone in the room, I decided to do my morning calisthenics exercises while I waited for Lupetta.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  *Kon*, the door was knocked on lightly just once while I was doing my waist twisting exercise.

  When I gave my permission to enter, I saw Lupetta standing there.

  「What’s wrong? Come on in」

  「Um……」

  As if she was surprised by how pumped up I sounded, Lupetta took a step back by the opened door.

  After I told her to come in again, *totototo*, Lupetta quickly came inside.

  「Mr.Captain?」

  「What?」

  Lupetta is staring at my face without blinking.

  It happens that I was born with a handsome face in this world, so I don’t dislike it. It’s something that I want to show off more and more.

  「Mr.Captain, um…you’re the son of the Qualdense family?」

  It’s not true right…? Is what Lupetta’s face was saying.

  I don’t know who she heard it from, but if anything, I want to ask her how she did not realize it until now.

  「You didn’t know? Yeah, I am」

  「Whatt……?!」

  Lupetta’s silver-colored eyes opened wide in astonishment.

  However, I have no intention of having such a boring conversation with her forever. I moved my fingers to tell her to come sit near me, but Lupetta isn’t seeing what I’m doing because she was distracted by the shock.

  「M-Mr.Captain…y-you’re the lord’s…son…?」

  「I said yes just now didn’t I?」

  「B-but…people call you captain」

  Since Lupetta is a freelance adventurer who was originally from a village and not a city, she might not really know that people could have multiple titles. 

  I explained to her that since I’m the lord’s son, I would also have a position in the army, so I’m serving as a commander as well.

 After I finished my explanation, her pale face stiffened and she got on her knees in a fluent movement. 

  Not only that, but she also went into a prostrating position before she opened her mouth with her shoulders trembling.

  「I’ve been so rude this whole time…please forgive me for my rudeness…」

  I feel bad seeing Lupetta being humble like that, but the way her hands were shivering was so adorable. She had the cuteness of a small animal.

  When I asked her about it again, it seems that she did indeed think that I was a commoner soldier who possessed magic power.

  She told me that when she described my appearance to the people at the outer city gate yesterday, they responded to her like “That’s the son of the Qualdense family, you know?!”

  「I’m glad that you got them to contact me by doing that」

  「I-I showed them this…」

  What Lupetta took out from her bag was the manalal crystal that I lent her.

  “I got it from Mr.Captain”. After she told the soldiers of the outer city gate that as showed the crystal to them, it seems that they thought that it was an expensive gem and they should contact me just in case.

  「I see. Well, whatever. …I am the heir of the Qualdense family. Qualdense Wilk」

  When I introduced myself in a manner that was as dignified as possible, Lupetta put her face down as she stayed prostrated. 

  By the way, in the Levios Kingdom and the Jinkaen Empire, there is a custom to give your family name first before your personal name. Furthermore, commoners cannot give themselves family names in both the kingdom and the empire.  

  「I would be troubled if you act so scared of me after all this time. You can just call me Mr.Captain like how you always have…when we’re on the bed that is」

  Lupetta raised her face timidly, and then she slowly opened her mouth.

  「…Mr.Captain」

  「There you go. Good girl」

  I smiled at her and patted the bed to tell her to take a seat there.

  Since it was an action I did every time I slept with her before she went into the field, she understood what I wanted her to do right away.

  She moved closer to me like a cautious cat and stopped right in front of me as I remained seated on the bed.

  「Hm? What’s wrong? Take a seat 」

  「Um, Mr.Captain…Erm, I’m dirty today…」

  Lupetta made a pose like she was hugging herself and refused to sit on the bed.

  She said that since she was too tired when she finally got back from the field yesterday, she did not take a bath.

  Because of that, right now she has a week plus of dirt accumulated on her.

  Although we’re in autumn, Lupetta was fairly sweaty from roaming around in the field. However, she has at least changed her clothes before coming here though. 

  「I don’t mind. Come on」

  After I grabbed her wrist and pulled her up towards the bed, Lupetta sat down on the bed reluctantly.

  「Lupetta」

  As I hugged her, the scent of sweat drifted to my nose.

  I pressed my nose on her and took a sniff of her scent.

  「Ah…Mr.Captain…No…I stink, stop it」

  「No you don’t…you smell good」

  The scent is a little strong, but I like it. The arousing fragrance of the concentrated scent of a female is mixed in her body odor.

  My cock got hard quickly when I was stimulated by the scent.

  I continued to take in that rich scent while she kept twisting her body like she was trying to get away.

  It wasn’t just her body scent, the ashamed expression she had on her face as she disliked being smelled by me was making me more excited than anything else.

  「Even though you were always that dirty until recently, you care about that now?」

  「Because after I experienced being clean once, the scent became noticeable…」

  When I first met Lupetta, she was a shame of a girl who did not care about grooming herself to the degree where it would make me sigh. 

  Her skin would be so dirty that I could tell that she almost never wiped herself, and I would smell a strong odor if I got close to her.

  Due to her taking a bath at the villa every time we slept together, she might have awakened to the nice things about being clean. It’s also possible that her female instincts were stimulated by how I kept telling her she was pretty. 

  Since I like clean girls anyway, I like that change of hers.

  「Mr.Captain, please. Let me take a bath first……」

  That shy way of speaking was very adorable, so I decided to allow her to take a bath.

  The bath is being prepared by Tesh right now. Since I just took one this morning, it probably wouldn’t take that long to prepare.

  I instructed the servant who is on standby outside of the room to let me know when the bath is ready.

  Until the bath is ready, I will talk to her to pass time.

  「Oh yeah, is Mergin doing alright?」

  「Y-yes!」

  Lupetta who had suddenly brightened up started thanking me again for yesterday.

  The corners of her eyes became wet as she looked at me while she sat on the bed.

  Mergin, who was like a worn-out rag, seemed to have recovered quite a bit thanks to the healers who were working at the military base.

  Lupetta said that after I left to subjugate the magic beast, she walked to the military base on her own to see him.

  If Mergin’s injuries were only from a day or two ago, there probably won’t be any negative aftereffects after he’s properly healed up. He was in luck.

  「Mr.Captain…Thank you, thank you so much…! I…I didn’t have anyone I could rely on…」

  While spilling teardrops that are like BB gun pellets, Lupetta continued to thank me.

  I put my hand on her back and gently stroked her. Then, her switch got flipped and she put her face down on the bed and began to sob.

  As I snuggled up to her and waited for her to calm down, I whispered to her,

  「Lupetta. You said it yesterday, right? You said that you would do anything」

  I would like to take my time to have a good talk with her as well, but I want to talk to her directly with my libido more since I haven’t had sex in 2 days.

  「……Yeah」

  I put my hand around her shoulder and pulled her towards me.

  The distance between our faces narrowed to just a fist length apart, and then I put my hand on the back of her head. 

  「Eh, ah…No……!」

  Was she afraid that I was going to kiss her? Lupetta shut her mouth tightly.

  After I saw that, I changed my target to her unprotected forehead and kissed her there.

*Chuu*, I deliberately kissed her while making a loud sound.

  「I want to kiss, Lupetta」

  I intentionally threw her a straight ball and told her what I want her to do.

  Lupetta could not break free no matter what since I’m hugging her, so she could only look away.

  「Noo……Mr.Captain, we had a promise, didn’t we…?」

  「Yes. That’s why I didn’t kiss your lips just now, did I?  But yesterday, you said you would do anything. Were you lying? Did you lie so that I would help Mergin?」

  「I-I wasn’t lying…but…」

  I put my fingers on her chin as she tried to look away and turned her face towards me. Those eyes of hers were full of uncertainty.

  「If that wasn’t a lie, then you’re going to do anything for me, right?」

  「……Alright……」

  「I’ll make you feel good too」

  Ehehe, with a fearless smile, I brushed my thumb across Lupetta’s lower lip like the letter 一.

  If it was in my past life, this overly sexual look would be sexual harassment, but in this life, it is just the smile of a cool and handsome young man. The difference because of appearance is such a cruel thing.

  「…I understand…but, wait, for just a little bit…」

  If she told me to wait because she’s going to be kissing Mergin from now on or something like that, I’m going to be mad.

  「Until after I clean myself in the bath…My mouth stinks too…」

  Lupetta’s cheeks were just slightly flushed as she tried to break free from my hug, but I put my hands around her waist to keep her here.

  I silently stroked her shoulder, her breasts, and her inner thighs. Without directly touching her skin, I slowly caressed her through the ordinary fiber of her two-piece outfit.

  My superb, hard cock is bulging to the point that it looks like it was going to rip through my pants and burst out. 

  Right when I was about to just push her over like this and start fucking her, a voice that informed me that the bath is ready came from the other side of the door.

  Saved by that voice, Lupetta used that chance to get away from me and quickly walked out of the room.

  I, who was left alone in the room, was left with a battle against an unsatisfied feeling.

  Since Lupetta was slightly dirty all over her body, the people who are in charge of the bath will be taking their time to wash her. She’ll probably be in there for a while.

  I felt like I would start masturbating if I just remained in the room, so I decided to take a walk around the villa.

  「Ah. Master…」

  「Oh. It’s you, Eve」

  Eve was walking down the hallway while carrying some stuff. She was probably on her way to work at the innovation association.

  Even though I call it “work”, since she’s only going to practice her writing, it wouldn’t affect anything even if she were to take a day off.

  I decided to have Eve work as a shadow this time as well.

  To my surprise, she did not look disgusted when I gave her that order. If anything, she looked relieved when she nodded.

  While feeling puzzled by her attitude, I returned to the room.

  *Kon*, the door was knocked on when I had just gone ahead and stripped myself fully naked after becoming impatient as I waited for Lupetta.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 83: Savoring the Female Adventurer Who Has a Swaying Heart (⅔)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  After Lupetta came into the room, she was surprised when she saw me waiting there for her fully naked.

  Since that look of surprise on her face was funny, I thrusted my hips to flaunt my erect cock to her.

  「Eekkkk…!」

  Lupetta covered her face with both of her hands like she was going to blow her nose and froze on the spot.

  Even though my cock is something that had already gone inside of her many times, she still has a cold attitude towards it.

  I sat on the bed and made a gesture with my hand to tell her to close the door.

  「Now, let’s enjoy our first secret date in a while」

  When I took a look at her appearance, she was wearing a thin undergarment that’s like a camisole and a dress combined. The color of the fabric is a calm black, making Lupetta give off the feeling of a composed adult female. Well, other than her breasts and height that is.

  After I told her to sit without intentionally specifying where, she sat down on the bed next to me at the distance of about one of her buttcheeks away. I’ll praise her well for sitting next to me without me telling her.  

  「Good girl」

  「Nn……」

  I put my hand on the back of hers and guided her hand to my crotch.

  「Ahh」

  I took her other hand as well and made her hold my cock with both of her hands.

  My cock was stimulated by the feeling of being wrapped by her hands, and the tip of it bulged greatly like it’s going to explode.

  Transparent precum overflowed from my slightly trembling cock as if it was screaming out to tell me “Hurry and put it in her”.

  「I wanted to see you, Lupetta, and then it became like this」

  「…Wow, it’s so hard…What is this…? Noo…is this pee…?」

  Lupetta saw the springwater-like juice that was streaming out of the tip and spilled out words of astonishment.

  「It’s harder than usual…」

  She said in fascination as she pressed the middle of my cock with her thumbs and middle fingers to check for its firmness.

  That way of using her fingers felt just a bit too pleasant, causing even more precum to come out.

  「You remember about my thing, huh? I’m flattered」

  For the few days before she went into the field, the afternoons could be pretty much called our sex time as I had sex with her almost every afternoon. She has probably memorized how my cock feels in that short period of time. Her body was steadily being dyed in the color of my existence.

  I stroked along her vibrant, dark-blue hair, and then I blew on her ear.

  Since I was constantly having sex all those days when I slept with Lupetta, I have never been this pent-up.

  This time, my cock is packed with a large amount of sex urges from not having sex for 2 days. The swelling and hardness of it are both on a different level. 

  「Didn’t you miss this while you were in the field?」

  「…I did not. Not really」

  「If that’s the case, I’m going to make you miss this from now on, okay?」

  With that, I put one hand around Lupetta’s back and my other hand on her chin.

  Her face stiffened a little. She was probably cautious about being kissed.

  Since I want to have an enjoyable kiss with her after waiting so long for this, I thought I should start talking to her so she could relax.

  I let go of her chin and put that hand into her undergarment. As I began touching her skin in a subtle manner, I opened my mouth.

  「Don’t be so tense. Lupetta, do you hate me?」

  「I-I don’t know」

  Although we’re in a relationship where she’s forced to have a physical relationship with me, I had a feeling that Lupetta doesn’t hate me that much.

  From her point of view, I’m her benefactor who has saved the life of the guy she likes twice. My likability must have already gone up by this point.

  Other than ejaculating inside her vagina, I have never forced her to do anything extreme in bed. Rather, I have been treating her gently.

  Even when we talk, it doesn’t feel like she hates me. If anything, I feel like Eve hates me much more.

  Lupetta’s body type is a complete “loli”, but since she has been experiencing life as she grew up to be the adult she is, she seems to have a fair understanding about the unreasonableness and trade-offs of the world. 

  She might know deep inside that her offering her body to me in return was something unavoidable.

  「No. You have to say it. Do you hate me? Or do you like me?」

  「…No…I don’t want to..say it」

  「I like you, Lupetta. I like you enough that I want you to be mine」

  Well, her virginity was already mine though.

  「I…I like Mergin…the most…」

  It can’t be helped that I would hear her talking about her unrequited love here, but the “I like Mergin the most” line caught my attention.

  That statement was probably true. However, from the wording of that, I could feel that her heart was swaying.

  「I see. You like Mergin the most, right? But there’s no limit on how many people you can like, right? So Lupetta, do you like me or do you hate me? Which is it?」

  「……Uuuu」

  As a part of my Lupetta training plan, I had been teaching her that she can’t lie to me on the bed whenever we slept together.

  And we are exactly on the bed here, so she is not allowed to lie to dodge my question.

  「Why do you not want to say it? Of course, if you hate me, you can just tell me you hate me. I won’t get mad…Just don’t lie to me」

  「Uu…I-I don’t hate you…」

  Lupetta spoke very hesitantly. However, she would score a 0 on a test if she answers the question of choosing like or hate with “It’s not hate”.

  While I rubbed her butt with the hand that went under her undergarment like I was playing around with her, I asked the same question again.

  「Lupetta. You can only answer with like or hate」

  「Ah…uu……」

  「Do you hate me?」

  「…I don’t…」

  I put my hand around her shoulder and rotated her around, then I hugged her from behind and stroked her head.

  「If you don’t hate me, then what? What is your answer here?」

  I softly whispered into her ear as I stroked her beautiful, firm leg.

  With the back of her head pressing on my chest, Lupetta muttered quietly,

  「……Uu……Ah……I-I might…like you…」

  Although I was squirming in excitement inside when Lupetta said that with her face red up to her ears, I pretended to be calm and continued to caress her lower body.

  Of course, my attack with words continued as well.

  「”Might” won’t do. Let me hear you one more time」

  「Uuu……」

  I used one of my hands to lock hands with her, and then as I looked at her at point-blank range from over her shoulder, we stared at each other.

  「……I-I like you」

  「Mm? I couldn’t hear you clearly. Say it one more time」

  I smiled and waited for her response again.

  When I used my fingers of the hand that I slipped into her crotch area to tease the area that’s just a bit away from her private region, Lupetta began wriggling her inner thighs.

  I repeatedly asked her the same question until she told me that she likes me so many times that it became repetitive.

  Her upper body, especially her chest area, was a non-erogenous zone that just feels ticklish to her if I touch her there, but her lower body is sensitive and she really feels it there.

  By simply making her tell me she likes me over and over as I teased her with my hand, I readied her to take in my cock.

  Even when her breathing became rough and erotic, I continued to make her talk.

  「…*Pant*, *pant*…Mm…*pant*…*pant*…I-I like…NOoooO, I told you already…ahh, ahhhh…ahhh…that spot-」

  「You like? I don’t know who exactly you mean by that. Tell me clearly. Who do you like?」

  「*Pant, *pant, *pant*…Mr.Captain…I like you…Uuuuu, ah, ahh, ahhh」

  「Is that the truth?」

  I repeatedly kissed her neck many times, and then I nibbled on her ear. When I slipped my fingers into her buttcrack, Lupetta’s back trembled greatly.

  「Ahhh…♡ Y-yes…Nnn, *pant*…B-but, I like Mergin more…ah, noo ♡」

  I went around from her butt and extended my fingers to her clitoris. Then, I began gently rubbing it.

  I continued to do that while feeling her shoulders twitch and her uneasy breathing.

  「Mr.Captain…Mnn ♡ …Please, stop teasing…noo…no more…Ahhhhh…ah, please, please stop, haa, ahhh ♡ More…Mnn, noo, more…」

  She looked at me with her big, moist, round eyes.

  That look made me want to tease her even more, but it appears that my body could no longer wait to have some kind of connection with her.

  「I’m glad that you told me that you like me. I really like you too, Lupetta」

  I rotated Lupetta, who I have been hugging from behind, and pushed her down onto the bed with her face up.

  After I leaned forward and covered her from above, I opened my mouth while I stared at her face as I moved closer to it.

  「I’m going to take all your first times」

  「Uu…」

  I put a hand on her chin and lifted it up.

  Perhaps tears had been accumulating in the corners of her eyes without me realizing it, so they began to drip down due to gravity.  

  「Lupetta, close your eyes. I’ll do it gently」

  I made Lupetta close her eyes as I played the role of a reliable man.

  Her tightly shut lips were a lot less tight compared to when I thought about kissing her earlier.

  I looked at those cute, light pink colored lips and brought my face closer to them.

  「……Mn」

  *Chuu*, our lips softly touched.

  There was a slight warm feeling and a springy sensation of flesh.

  Her head moved slightly to the side like she was trying to escape, but I held onto her face with my hand to prevent that and firmly pressed my lips on hers.

  「Mmn……Mn, mnn……」

  Perhaps it’s because I continued to kiss her forcefully, she was gradually strengthening her lips to keep them shut.

  I moved my tongue up and down rapidly like a snake, and I tickled the border between her upper lips and bottom lips, making a sound as I sucked on them entirely.

  「MMMnnnnnnnnn-!」

  As Lupetta continued to make sounds out of her throat with her mouth closed, I decided to put an end to our first kiss.

  *Chuu*, I took my lips off of hers, but I waited for her to open her eyes without moving my face away. 

  I stared at her eyes that she slowly opened and then I gently rubbed her cheek.

  「That was our first kiss」

  「Ahh…Mergin…Mer-gin…」

  「Lupetta. Tell me you like me one more time」

  Even though I made her say that so much that it could be repulsive for her, Lupetta responded with a deadpan expression.

  「Mr.Captain, I like you…」

  「Good girl」

  I brought my face closer to hers again and kissed her. 

  *Chu*, *chu*, *chu*, as if I was bouncing off her lips this time, I enjoyed that sensation of elasticity as I kissed her.

  I repeatedly gave her the bird peck kisses, and then I sucked on her lips as hard as I could in the end.

  *Slurp*, *slurp*, *slurp*, with such watery sounds, I enjoyed the Lupetta’s taste.

  「Mm…*Puah*. Haaa…Lupetta…That was our second kiss, you know?」

  I counted it out loud to her to engrave our kiss into her memory.

  「Do you like me, Lupetta?」

  「…I like you」

  「Mmhm. I like you too, my adorable Lupetta」

  The third kiss. And then during our fourth kiss where I did the same things, Lupetta gradually became more used to kissing with me.

  Our skin touched and our lips joined while I continued to caress her clitoris as well. The longer it went on, the louder the moans that were leaking out of her lips became.

  On our 8th kiss, Lupetta finally allowed my tongue to invade her.

  「Ah…Mnnchuu…Mnn…*kiss* *slurp*, puahh, *pant*, *kiss*…*kiss*」

  「*Pant*…Lupetta. That’s good. More of that」

  「Ah……*kisskiss*, *kiss*. Puahh, *pant, *pant*……」

  I entangled her tongue with mine, and then when I intensified my caressing as my saliva flowed into her mouth, Lupetta gripped onto the bedsheet and squirmed around, messing up the neatly set bedsheet. 

  The sopping love juice that was dripping out of her wet the palm of my hand brilliantly. The female scent that was drifting from her crotch comfortably stimulated my nostrils.

  「That was our 9th kiss」

  「Mnn…I like, I like you, so…ah…ahhhhh ♡ Mm, *pant*, *pant*…Mnnn, *kiss*」

  I stroked Lupetta’s head like “good girl, good girl” with the hand that didn’t have her love juice on it, and then I gave her another steamy kiss.

  I can tell what her answer is just by looking at her even without asking her anymore.

  The way Lupetta continued to move her lower body restlessly looked like she’s actually asking for sex.

  「*Kiss*…*kiss*. *kiss*, *slurp*…Mnn *kiss* ♡ *Pant*, *pant*, *kisskiss*…*kiss*, *slurp*, Mnnn, Nnaaaa, *pant* ♡」

  After her steamy eyes became teary from the sexual stimulation, I took my face away.

  Since I have been casually taking Lupetta’s undergarment off as I kissed and caressed her, Lupetta was almost completely naked.

  When I showed Lupetta my bulging, gleamy, wet cock that looked like it was going to ejaculate, she looked at it with a look of ecstasy.

  「*Pant*, *pant*, *pant*…Mr.Captain…S-stop teasing me already…no more…please…」

  Lupetta looked at me with a bewitching look as her body fidgeted like she was holding in her piss.

  That sad and painful expression on her face had enough destructive power to destroy my reasoning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 84: Savoring the Female Adventurer Who Has a Swaying Heart (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Did she understand that foreplay was over? Lupetta’s expression loosened up just a little. I placed my hand on her cheek and we shared a light kiss.

  「*Chuu*…♡」

  「Lupetta. I’m going to make you feel good again, okay?」

  I dropped kisses on her lips, her neck, the crease of her collarbone, her breasts, her stomach, and her completely wet pussy.

  As I moved to her lower body, I felt hints of expectations mixed in her moans.

  「Ah, ahhhhh. Nnn ♡ Mr-Mr.Captain…Mnn, *pant*, *pant*. *Pant*」

  Lupetta is an adult woman regardless of what her body looks like, so her pubes have been properly growing as well. Since it’s not like she’s having sex with her beloved Mergin, she has not been shaving them.

  Due to the love juice that overflowed, her pubes got wet and some parts of them bundled up and hardened.

  「It looks like I can just put it in no problem as it is」

  「Eh……」

  When I spoke to her after I had just kissed her hips, she leaked out a disappointed voice.

  As I lifted up my face and looked at her, I saw her looking at me imploringly.

  「Lupetta」

  I moved up to her ear and whispered in it with a low voice. 

  My fingers crawled into her pussy that had turned into a swamp, and they continued to tease her to not let her excitement level drop.

  「*Pant*, *pant*…Mr.Captain, uuuuuu…ah ♡ Nnnn ♡ haa……」

  「Don’t worry, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Now, try to tell me what you want me to do. It’s okay to ask me to spoil you」

  How the women around here see sex is that sex is an act to please men, so it’s lewd for a woman to seek pleasure.

  They react honestly when they feel good during the intercourse, but even just that makes them quite embarrassed.

  I already know why Lupetta is being so fidgety while she’s looking at me.

  It’s because she likes having her pussy licked, or in other words, cunnilingus. Although her lower body is sensitive, I think she likes it mostly because it’s mentally stimulating for her.

  In the Elluo continent, men generally dominate women, so a man going down on a woman is something that’s very unlikely to happen.

  When I went down on Minith and the others, they were so satisfied that it was entertaining.

Having their privates licked by a man, who is their master on top of that, seems to really turn them on.

  Lupetta did not really want me to go down on her when we first slept together, but now she’s already a complete slave to it.

  「AHHHHhhhh, nooo, it’s embarrassing, *pant*, *pant*, no, ahh ♡ Please…Mnnn ♡」

  「I won’t know unless you tell me. Tell me, Lupetta. What do you want me to do?」

  “You want it here, right?” I slightly strengthened the stimulation of her clitoris with my fingers as if I was asking her that.

  Lupetta’s body shook all over in response like it was letting me take charge as it entrusted itself to me.

  「You can be honest when it’s just us. You can be honest and act spoiled in this room. Now, tell me. What do you want me to do?」

  「Mm, ahh, *pant*, Mr.Captain, I-I want you to do the thing you usually do ♡ *pant*, *pant*…」

  During the few days before she went into the field, I licked her vagina every time we slept together. The way she would scream out loudly in a high pitched voice as she surrendered her body to me was very enjoyable.

  This is obvious, but I have no desire to go down on her at all after I cum in her vagina. Since I don’t have a hobby of drinking semen,  if I’m going to go down on her, now is the only time. 

  「The thing I usually do?」

  「……Ah, Nn…D-don’t tease me…Ahhh ♡ Mmnnnn, noo, ahh ♡」

  「Where…and what do you want me to do?」

  「Ahhhhh, nooo, Ahhhhh ♡ Ahhh……♡」

  If I tease her too much, Lupetta might end up always cowering away from me.

  After exchanging a deep-kiss with her, I looked at her with a smile.

  「I got it. I’ll make you feel good」

  「Ah ♡ Un…」

  I changed Lupetta into a sit-up position, and then I dove my head between her legs that formed a triangular mountain.

  Her wet, glistening, beautiful pink-colored vagina was waiting for me in her swamp region.

  「Ahh ♡」

  I pushed my tongue out as far as I could and pressed it on her vagina. Then, slowly and gently, I moved my tongue going from the bottom of it to the top.

  「Mnn, NOOOooo, AHH, ahhhhhh, MnnnnOhhhhhh」

  I stimulated her with my fingers as well and attacked her like I was searching for her weak spots.

  Although I already have somewhat of a grasp on where her weak spots are, it’s not fun to just attack them right away.

  I avoided quite a bit of the areas that would make her feel good with my tongue because I want to make love to Lupetta while she moans out in frustration as she frets over me doing that.

  「Ahh, Uuuuu, no…Ah ♡ I-I’m going crazy ♡…Ah, ahhh, there, it feels good right there. Hiaaaa ♡」

  She’s probably really messing up the bedsheets judging from the sounds of fabric rubbing that I hear echoing in the room. She’s pulling on them to express how good she’s feeling.

  「*Lick*」

  「AHHHHHHHHHH ♡ AHHHHHHHhhh ♡ Ah, nn, AHHHH, I-I can’t think straighttt ♡ NoooooOOooo ♡ Mergin, Mergin! Ahhhhh…」

  When I stroked her clitoris with the tip of my tongue like I was tickling her, her hips tried to get away from it. I could hear her rough breathing and her cries.

  She’s a bad woman who calls the name of another guy in bed. I intensified my tongue’s and my fingers’ caressing and attacked her weak spots all at once.

  「Ah, AHnnnn ♡ N-NO, NOO, I-I’m TURNINGG WEIRDDD! N-NO MORE! STOP! I’M SCAREDD! AH, AHHHHHH♡」

  She pushed her hips up and tried harder to get away from my caressing.

  Maybe she was afraid of cumming, so she clinched onto my head with her thighs.

  I opened her legs up and pushed them up as it is, changing her pose into one that’s like a baby getting her diaper changed. It’s the pile driver sex position. 

  「AHHH, DON’T LOOK, NOO, IT’S EMBARRASSING!」

  「I will make you feel good with my thing as well」

  I placed my almost exploding cock on the opening of her exposed, defenseless vagina.

  「Ah…NOOo…UuuuuUUUUUUU」

  Although Lupetta had gotten quite used to my caressing, she’s still pretty hesitant about making babies with me. 

  Well, that may be the case, but it’s not like she can go against my will. She can only say no with her voice.

  「I’m putting it in, Lupetta」

  「……Mnnnaahhhh ♡」

  I paid no mind to her hiding her face with her hands and began putting it in.

  As if her vagina forgot about how to take a man inside, it squeezed on my cock tightly.

  「Ohhhhhh…This is nice. *pant*, *pant*, Lupetta」

  After I made sure that I was almost balls deep in her, I brought my face closer to hers.

  Lupetta’s eyes were closed as she endured our intercourse with an expression that was mixed with agony and a bit of joy.

  「*Kiss* ♡」

  The feeling of satisfaction filled my heart as both our upper body and lower body connected.

  The missionary position is nothing without kissing after all.

  「*Kiss*…Mnn…Mr…Captain…」

  「You’re doing great」

  I put my hand on her chin and kissed her again. Then, I don’t know if she did it unintentionally, but she opened her mouth wide and showed me her pink tongue. 

  The kisses we had just now was just kisses on the lips, so I wanted to deepen our relationship further with more tongue exchanges. Lupetta might have thought about the same thing too. She’s doing this consciously, isn’t she?

  「Lupetta」

  I extended my tongue out and our tongues intertwined as I pressed my lips on hers.

  *Kisskiss*, *Slurpslurp*, with such sounds, I devoured her lips as our saliva mixed together. 

  While I continued my lower body thrusting exercises in a relaxed manner so that I wouldn’t climax, I continued to kiss her as we felt each other’s breathing.

  「Mmnn*Kiss*……!」

  I stopped the kiss and we looked at each other again. With a feverish expression on her face, the corners of Lupetta’s eyes were filled with tears.

  「What’s wrong?」

  「D-don’t be so gentle…I don’t…like it…」

  Even though she really likes it when I’m gentle, she asked me not to be gentle to her.

  When I’m told that, I’m going to end up wanting to be gentle to her since I want to spite her.

  「I want to be gentle to you. You’re so cute, Lupetta」

  I whispered sweet words to her, kissed her, and whispered sweet words to her again.

  The love talk I said to her was a corny rotation of words like “you’re so cute”, “I like you”, “you’re so cute”, but because of the stimulation she’s feeling from my cock in her vagina, my fingers on her clitoris, and the sense of unity from our kiss, it robbed her of her ability to think.

  She moaned as she spilled out large drops of tears.

  「AHhhhhhhh ♡ *Pant* ♡ *pant*, *pant*, noouu…stop, don’t be so gentle…」

  「Don’t worry, Lupetta. Just relax」

  I hugged her tightly and gave her a hot kiss.

  I felt her vagina tremble with my cock. I am the same way, but it seems that she was close to cumming.

  「NONONONO-ahhhh, don’t-don’t be so gentle. Ah ♡ Ah ♡ Uaa ♡ Uuuahhh ♡ Don’t be so gentle, I’m going to fall in love. Noo, ahhhh ♡ MERGIN, MERGIN, MERGIN…I’M SCAREDDdd…AHHH ♡ NO, AH, RIGHT THERE ♡ Ahh, I’M GOING TO…FALL IN LOVE. NOOoo……」

  It seems that hearing her yell out another guy’s name while I’m fucking her aroused my desire to monopolize her.

  When I felt a feeling of anger or something, I felt my cock become the hardest it’s been today. 

  I pulled her butt towards me and I thrusted my cock as deep in her as I could.

  「Lupetta. It’s coming out! I’m going to cum inside you!」

  「AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!」

  *Spurt*! Spurt, spurtspurtspurtspurt!

  Seeds flew out like I was claiming her as mine.

  Beastlike emotions were born inside of my heart as her vagina got filled with my seeds, and those emotions turned into a roar,  

  「Lupetta! You are mine! Lupetta!」

  I wonder if it’s because I yelled such words out, my excitement that started to go down after I started cumming spiked up again.

  「AHHHHHHHHH ♡」

  *Spurt*! *Spurt*! *Spurttt*! 

  I climaxed again unexpectedly, and then I hugged her strongly to let her know that I don’t want to waste a single drop of my seeds. 

  Lupetta was unbearably adorable as she accepted my semen while she trembled in my chest.

  As I became drunk in my continuous ejaculation like I was taking a piss, I sucked on her mouth.

  It’s so comfortable that I want to fall asleep with the two of us becoming one like this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 85: The State of the City
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  From the length of the beams of light that were shining in through the curtain, I noticed that the sun had already risen to a position that’s between morning and noon. 

  Lupetta and I seemed to have fallen asleep for just a little bit with our genitals still connected as we clung together.

  Since I have to take Lupetta to the military base by noon, we can’t be having sex in bed all day.

I shook off my sleepiness and called out to Lupetta who was dozing off in my arms.

  「Lupetta」

  「……Mn」

  Sure enough, I have already claimed her lips so many times I could no longer keep count.

  *Chuu*, *chuu*, *chuu*, I urged her to wake up with those multiple kissing sounds. 

  「I know this is sudden, but I want you to go into the field later today」

  「…I thought I might get called for that. I’m ready to do so」

  Things ended inconclusively yesterday since a magic beast appeared in the middle of our talk, but I did tell her that I wanted her to go into the field together with the military.

  It seems that Lupetta had considered that the army might call her for that, so she took care of her equipment’s maintenance in advance before she went to bed last night.

  「So you already got ready, huh? Good girl」

  「Mnmn…*chuu*」

  I kissed her as a reward and patted her head.

  「Do I just follow you and your team in there, captain?」

  「No, I won’t be going into the field」

  「What…」

  The team that’s going into the field won’t be a team that I’ll be leading, so I told Lupetta that I would like her to be that unit’s navigator.

  While I was at it, I also took the opportunity to tell her that we won’t be seeing each other for some time because I’m leaving for Nambonan city tomorrow. That information is not confidential so it’s okay to let her know.

  「There’s going to be so many people I don’t know…」

  I think she’s the type who will isolate herself if she’s thrown in a group with an unspecified number of people she doesn’t know at all. Moreover, since it’s the army, there will only be men around, so it’s no wonder she’s worried. 

  However, Lupetta’s participation is needed as a person who had a deadly fight with the mystery man from the Synod Church.

  After I explained the importance of her field expedition to her, I gently hugged her.

  「Don’t worry, I will tell the guys in the army ahead of time to not do anything bad to you. Trust me」

  With her face buried in my chest, she opened her mouth to give me a short reply.

  「……Okay」

  Her small and frail back is so cute, it makes me want to go another round with her.

  Maybe she felt my cock getting hard, Lupetta looked up at me and said,

  「Mr.Captain. We have to get ready soon…A festival is going on right now so the streets are crowded」

  The villa is pretty much at the city’s center, located in a corner of the high-class residential street. To get to the military base that’s located outside of the castle town from here takes a bit of walking.

  「A festival? There’s something like that going on right now?」

  There are many festivals in a year, but I didn’t know there’s such an event happening today.

  How do I put it? It’s strange that Lupetta knows about it but I don’t when she’s not even from here.

  「Yeah」

  「Really…? What kind of festival is it?」

  Festivals in the city of Nyuneri usually start in the afternoon, evening, or at night.

  The city’s illumination magic circles would be fully activated on those nights, and sometimes the wealthy would donate and set up lighting equipment similar to paper lanterns, creating a fun atmosphere.

  It’s not that we don’t have any festivals that start from the morning, but the only ones that come to mind are the festivals to celebrate the beginning of a new year.

  「To celebrate the defeat of the magic beast」

  「Oh, that thing I took down, huh?」

  The appearance of a magic beast is a great threat to the public. Especially because it’s harvest season right now, the people living in the agriculture area were probably all going pale.

  Not only would a magic beast trample all the crops, depending on the situation, it could also pollute the soil and then nothing will grow for several years. 

  That low pitched alarm definitely brought fear into the city.

  「Eh? Ah, that’s right. Mr.Captain is a noble…」

  Lupetta nodded to herself convincingly as if she just remembered that I was a noble.

  It’s natural for nobles to fight magic beasts.

  「A festival to celebrate the successful subjugation, huh? I guess that’s a thing too」

  「The city is packed with people. That’s why we should…」

  「I see. Let’s go get ready to go then」

  With just one last deep kiss, I pulled out my cock that was in Lupetta.

  White cloudy body fluid spilled out, and the scene of the fluid glittering in the sunlight was truly refreshing.

  Lupetta and I went into the bathroom that’s divided to the women’s bath and the men’s bath, and then we returned to the bedroom.  

  As she sat on the sofa dressed and ready to go, she looked at me and said,

  「Mr.Captain. About the babies…are they okay?」

  「The ones you picked up in the field?」

  「Yeah」

  Lupetta had picked up 8 babies from the field.

  Due to a long time of shaking around in the mining carts, the leeches that were sucking on their blood here and there, and them not eating anything for more than a day, all 8 of them were in a really weakened state.

  「Right now, the army is looking after them. We haven’t decided what we’re going to do with them yet」

  「…What’s going to happen to them then?」

  There is an orphanage in the city of Nyuneri as well, but I can’t really say that it has a good environment.

  If the children are around 4 or 5 years old and expect to work, the orphanage will take them in. However, if they are just babies that’ll take up a lot of people’s time, they might possibly be denied. Even if the orphanage accepts the babies, they probably won’t be properly cared for. Developments like “I left them on the floor and then they died after they got stepped on!” are also highly possible.

  To young boys and girls, the orphanage is a labor camp with a cruel environment, but to infants, it’s a cradle to wait to die in. 

  The 8 babies Lupetta saved too, if they were ordinary babies, their short lives could soon come to an end in an orphanage. 

  「Don’t worry. Those babies will make it somehow. I can’t tell you any details but…」

  「Really? That’s great」

  Lupetta became relieved as she looked like she believed my words without any doubt.

  That trust made me happy and it made me want to kiss her. …Then I decided to do so.

  「Lupetta」

  「Mmm…」

  Surprisingly, all 8 of those babies possessed magic power.

  When the soldiers came to ask me what to do about them, I noticed them getting thinly caught in my magic detection.

  It’s unthinkable for 8 babies with magic power to be together in a normal circumstance.

  Anyway, if they are babies who possess magic power and don’t know how to think for themselves, many people will want to take them in. No matter what happens, they will be able to live a life with freedom, unlike average commoners.

  Since there’s a high possibility that those babies are related to the Synod church’s plan, they will be confiscated by the Qualdense family.

  I’m sure that right about now in the castle of Nyuneri, my father is in a good mood thinking about how he’s going to deploy them.

  Our lips parted and I met Lupetta’s eyes.

  「Come back here after you’re all set to leave. I’ll take you to the army」

  「…Okay」

  After making a small arrangement with her, Lupetta went back to the inn to get her luggage.

  I got on the horse that the villa servants prepared for me and exited the villa.

  Like Lupetta said, the festival seems to be causing a stir in the city of Nyuneri, so I judged that it would be better for me to ride a horse so I can open up a path through the citizens as well.

 

  After Lupetta prepared herself to enter the field, she was wearing clothes with long sleeves and long pants that seem easy to move in, with a cloak that’s like a hooded robe on top. The sword she had by her waist and the spear she was carrying on her shoulder really matched her clothes.

  The tip of her spear had a sack tied to it with a string. For some reason, it reminded me of couriers in the Edo period of Japan. 

  I explained to her that the military will bring food in there, so she’s only carrying the bare minimum amount of equipment she needs. 

  「Let’s go」

  「…Yes sir」

  I told her many times before we left to leave the bedroom attitude in the bedroom, so she did not reply to me in an overly familiar way. 

  Lupetta was walking directly behind me as my horse moved.

  When I entered the main street on a horse with dignity, the citizens were delighted.

  Knowing that the magic beast was subjugated is something for the citizens to be happy about, but I don’t know why they are taking a day off work.

  「Since the warning of the appearance of the magic beast came out, the city got into a state of emergency. Once a fight with a mature magic beast starts, the battle could last more than a day or two. The citizens were prepared to be on lockdown for the next several days」

  「The citizens had only found out that the magic beast had been subjugated this morning. No one woke up expecting to work this morning」

  When I tried asking my escorts about it, they replied to me like that.

  「I see」

  By the way, it seems that the citizens of the city were instructed to refrain from leaving their homes for a few days.

  However, the magic beast was defeated overnight. It’s inevitable that they would be excited and start celebrating in the morning.

 

  「Indeed, it’s because we defeated it on the same day」

  Normally, a mature magic beast is not something that can be defeated in a few hours. You have to have an army whittle its stamina down bit by bit and have nobles attack it with magic when they see any openings. It’s an endless cycle of repeating that before the beast could go down.

  For example, my grandmother had fought against a mature magic beast when she was still alive, but that subjugation seems to have lasted about 3 days.

  As a side note, after my grandmother defeated that magic beast, it seems she caught a weird illness that ate away at her spirit and died. I’m not quite sure about the incident because nobody told me about it in detail.

  Anyway, I have no choice but to quarantine myself from the castle of Nyuneri after I defeated the magic beast. I have used healing magic on my entire body many times so I don’t think I am infected, but it’s just in case.

  「Young masterrr!」

  「Kyaaaaaaa! *Squealing*」

  「Congratulations on your successful magic beast subjugation!」

  The closer we got to the center of the city, the louder the crowd’s cheers became.

  The fact that me, the feudal lord’s son, Qualdense Wilk had removed the threat of the magic beast that was approaching the city had already become widely known. 

  Now, since the management of fields is part of a feudal lord’s task, there seems to be still room for criticism like “It’s because the lord’s management of the field is lacking that a magic beast came out. He should be thinking of measures to prevent that from happening. This time the beast was subjugated so everything’s great, but what would happen next time if the magic beast gets into the city?”  

  In reality, no citizens would dare to say that to their lord, but it makes sense that they would have those thoughts.

  However, since the appearance of a mature magic beast is treated as a type of natural calamity since ancient times, being able to stop one is considered to be lucky to an extent.

  And from the citizens’ way of thinking, rather than focusing on the fact that a magic beast had come out of the field, their heads would prioritize thoughts like “The nobles defeated the magic beast! Woohoo! They are so strong! They are amazing! Nyuneri will be safe now!”.

  That’s why the citizens are cheering for me and welcoming me with open arms.

  There are so many citizens in the city square. It reminded me of a crowded train from Japan in my past life.  

  「Why are there so many people gathered here?」 

  「This morning, the dismantling of the magic beast had been completed and the magic stone was brought here. Since it’s being disclosed to the public as well, everyone gathered here to take a look at it. The magic stone of a mature magic beast is something that’s very rare」

  One of my escorts who is walking next to me followed up on my idle complaint.

  「Ohh? I want to take a look at that later」

 

  「It’s on display along with the magic stone that came from the mature magic beast that Lady Cassia defeated in the city of Evermill. It’s understandable that the citizens would be so excited」

  My grandmother Cassia had already passed away by the time I was born, but she was still really popular in the people’s hearts.

  She’s a lineal descendant of the Qualdense family, the feudal lord of two generations ago, she strengthened the influence of our family, she has achievements of subjugating mature magic beasts, and the “Fifth Region Princess” play is about her. There are many reasons for why she is popular.  

  「The former lord will also be pleased. If he finds out that Lady Cassia’s grandson has defeated a mature magic beast…I feel like he would rush back on a horse to Nyuneri all by himself」

「I think so too」

  To my surprise, my grandfather was the one who married into the Qualdense family.

Since my father was still young when grandmother passed away, my grandfather became the head of the family temporarily as grandmother’s spouse. He had quickly let my father inherit the family when my father became a proper noble and now he participates in wars for the family.

  If grandfather who has forever loved grandmother finds out about this incident, I feel like he’ll come back here just to praise me.

  Since the citizens filling up the plaza were all looking at me as I rode through on a horse, I lightly waved my hand at the crowd.

  Then thundering cheers rang out and the heat of the plaza rose at once. It feels great.

  「Since they’re throwing a festival like this, shall we bring some alcohol here later in my name?」

  To a feudal lord, being popular with the citizens isn’t that important, but it’s normal for people to want to be liked rather than disliked.

  After I consult my father, let’s try to send some gofers out. 

  When I brought Lupetta to the military base after going through the crowd, many soldiers with black shields on their backs were waiting there. It seems like they will be the expedition force into the field this time.

  I let the captain of that unit know clearly to not let anyone put their hands on her and entrusted Lupetta to him.

  Since Lupetta is cooperating with us willingly as a guest, the soldiers are carrying her stuff for her.

  The awkward look she had on her face with her hands emptied out was kind of cute. 

  Their destination is deep in the field, so they probably won’t be back anytime soon.

  I handed her the charm that was recharged with my magic power and saw her off.

Chapter 86: Babies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  After I saw Lupetta off, I heard a soldier calling for me right when I was about to leave. 

  Since I could recognize that guy’s face, he is probably someone in an executive position.

  「Young master. I would like to talk to you about those babies」

  「What about them?」

  Lupetta had picked up as many as 8 babies.

  They ranged from babies who could only roll around on the floor to babies who could crawl.

  It seems that the military had made full use of the soldiers’ personal connections and found some women who could breastfeed. The weakened babies’ conditions slightly improved after they got to drink some milk.

  Then when he tried to scout the gathered women to work as wet nurses, half of them refused.

  The women’s reason for refusing was simple, they said they didn’t want to come to the military base for work.

  And it seems that the remaining half of the women who were willing to work were also asking if they could work at a place other than the military base if possible.

  「Because this base is outside of the castle town and soldiers also gather here…」

  Since the military base where the babies are at right now is outside of the castle town, some people have to make quite a journey to get here. Moreover, this place is packed with soldiers. It’s not really a place women would want to get close to.

  「I see」

  It’ll probably take some time until we decide on what we’re going to do with the babies in the future, so we have to look after them for a while.

  They already don’t have a mother, so if they don’t have a wet nurse either, they’ll be heading straight for death from starvation. We’ll need to be considerate about the wet nurses’ work environment. Even though we are the ones recruiting, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll all just hop on board.

  From the army’s point of view as well, if we just leave the babies here, they’ll probably become a burden to the soldiers.  

  「Alright. If that’s the case, bring the babies to the villa. It’ll probably give the nannies an easier time going to work too」

  Since the villa is in the castle town, the wet nurses wouldn’t have to go all the way past the city gate for their part-time job, and the villa won’t be packed with soldiers either. Even if the wet nurses work overnight, it would be far more comfortable for them to stay there instead of here.

  The babies will also probably be happier being taken care of by the beautiful maids in the villa rather than the sweaty men of the army. I know I would be if it was me.

  「That would be very helpful. Would it be alright for me to ask you to deal with that matter?」

  「Yeahh, I’ll explain it to my father」

  I wrote everything regarding what I want to do with the babies down on paper, and then I entrusted it to a messenger.

  After that, I walked to the innovation association through the city that was in a festive mood and found out that only a few corporate slaves in managerial positions had come to work.

  I was thinking about making babies with Mimon in the afternoon, but sadly, it appears that she is taking today off.

  While I made the arrangements to serve alcohol in the city square and double-checked on what the people of the innovation association are going to do after I leave for Nambonan, the sun had begun to set. 

  When I walked down the hallways in the villa, I could hear the cries of babies coming from a distance.

  It looks like the babies were moved here right away.

  The servants of the villa now have the additional task of taking care of the babies, but they won’t need to take care of me after I leave tomorrow so I hope they can just put up with it for now.

  When I hear the term “wet nurse”, the first thing that comes to mind is Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu’s wet nurse, Lady Kasuga. 

  Since Lady Kasuga has the image of a big shot grandma in my head, a wet nurse and a grandma is pretty much the same thing to me. Perhaps it’s because of that, the existence of young wet nurses slipped my mind.

  But if I think about it again rationally, a wet nurse is someone who is expected to act as a tank of breastmilk. In other words, a woman who had recently given birth.

  So considering the age people give birth on the continent of Elluo, it’s very possible that young mothers had come to the villa for the job.

  「Hm」

  I’ll need to check those wet nurses out as they’ll be responsible for the babies. If they are young beautiful mommas then I want to check out how their milk tastes as well.

  As I went down the hallway following the cries of the babies, I caught a servant who was walking by and made him guide me to them. 

  「Welcome back, young master」

  A slightly spacious room had been nicely prepared for the babies to stay in.

  The servants who were on standby in the room greeted me respectfully as they saw me.

  「Good work on the swift response in this matter」

  I showed my appreciation for them as I looked around the room.

  The maids of the villa, the women who are working as part-time wet nurses, and Eve, were all taking care of the babies.

  For some reason, there weren’t only 8 babies, but about double that number.

  「Why are there so many babies here?」

  「That is because the nannies brought their babies here too」

  One of the maids who was taking care of the babies answered my question.

  I see, since these are women who could breastfeed after recently giving birth, it makes sense that they would also have babies of their own…

  They can’t just leave their babies in their homes when they have to breastfeed them too, so they brought them along.

  「I see」

  The several wet nurses seemed to have noticed that I was the “young master”, so they got on their knees and bowed on the floor. I waved my hand to the side to let them know that they can relax.

  Unfortunately, there wasn’t anyone amongst the part-time wet nurses who made me feel excited. Although they’re not actually too bad if I just look at their age; the youngest one feels like a high schooler and the oldest one seems like a university student.

  「Which ones are those 8 babies?」 

  「They’re over here. They have a red string tied around one of their legs.」

  I could tell which babies possess magic power right away, but the servants would only be able to tell them apart by their faces.

  It seems they have put a mark on them so that they would never mix them up.

  「Hmm. Speaking of which, how many of them are boys and how many of them are girls?」

  「Half and half. 4 of them are boys and 4 of them are girls」

  Like what the maid said, some of the babies did indeed have a red string tied around one of their legs. Their chubby legs were truly baby-like even with the strings tied around their legs like a rubber band.

  I checked out the female babies’ faces to see if any of them look like they would likely grow into beauties in the future, but unfortunately, I could not predict anything from looking at them.

  「Daaa~!」

  Then, *tap*, *tap*, *tap*, the biggest baby out of the 8 who had a red string around her leg crawled towards me steadily. I could see that this baby was much more mature compared to the others who were rolling around.  

  Since she crawled all the way to me, I tried poking her pudgy cheeks that were like a squirrel’s after it stuffed its mouth full, and then I tried holding her in my arms. It felt like I was holding onto a hot water bottle because of her high body temperature.

  Her big round eyes are adorable. This baby might grow up to be a beauty.

  「Daaaau~」

  I tried playing with the other 7 babies in turns as well, but I don’t know if it’s because they are sleepy or tired or in a bad mood, they didn’t really react to me much. 

  The most energetic one was the baby who came up to me in the beginning. She would react to anything I did, making me want to play with her.

  「This kid is the cutest one」

  While I was poking at her feet silently, I felt someone looking at me all of a sudden.

  Apparently, Eve was staring at me.

  「What is it?」

  Shocked by the fact that I noticed her gaze, Eve’s shoulders trembled and she looked down.

  There was a half-naked baby in front of her. She was probably in the middle of changing the baby’s diaper.  

  「N-nothing…」

  Since Eve said it was nothing, I tried to play with that baby again.

  When I lifted the baby up high in the air, *kyaa*, *kyaa*, she made sounds of joy.

  I didn’t marry or have kids in my past life, so I have never held a baby before.

  The maids next to me were watching me anxiously, but I don’t have a hobby of dropping babies on the floor so I wish they would just relax.

  As I thought, Eve was looking at me with a look of surprise again.

  「Come on Eve, what is it?」

  「Er, erm…Master, you really like babies, don’t you…?」

  It’s strange because when she says it like that, it feels like she’s calling me a weird freak.

  If I were to compare my taste in women to pitches that go through the strike zone in baseball, babies and children would be a wild pitch that’s so off to the level of hitting the backstop fence. I’m not a pervert who would put my hands on a baby.

  「What about you, Eve? You really like them too, don’t you? You seem to be quite used to taking care of them」

  Eve wrapped the towel-like cloth around a baby skillfully.  

  Then, she put the baby in her arms as if she was trying to calm her own shaken emotions down.

  「…I have been taking care of the neighbor’s babies back in my village as well」

  Due to the royal army’s great expedition to the north, the village Eve used to live in was destroyed in the process. Eve was captured along with her mother, and then her second life as a sex slave began.

  It might be natural for her to be used to taking care of babies since she’s initially a village girl.

  「……Ow! Hey, you can’t do that~ Big sister here is not your mama. Nothing is going to come out of my breasts~」

  It seems the baby in her arms grabbed Eve’s breast while being oblivious to what’s happening.

  The baby probably wanted to suck on her nicely developed breasts after it saw them. I understand where the baby’s coming from. 

  Seeing Eve caring for babies has an indescribable feeling of pleasantness to it.

  So she can smile like that, huh…   

  I felt an urge of wanting to get a good taste of Eve one more time before I leave for Nambonan.

  Let’s make tons of love to her on the bed tonight.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 87: Savoring the Slave Elf Girl Who Learned to Have A Sense Of Danger (⅓)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  What Eve put on after she got out of the bath today was a slip dress. 

  The texture of the white silk really matched her white skin.

  The small shoulder straps of her dress, her collarbones that stood out, and above all, the cleavage of her nicely developed breasts all made my heart beat faster.  

  Just sitting next to her made my cock shift into children making mode. 

  「Master, would you like another glass?」

  Eve reached for the decanter with grape juice inside after she noticed that my goblet was emptied.

  I instinctively followed her slender arm that was reaching forward with my eyes.

  When I think about how her art-like beauty belongs to me, blood just rushes to my head.

  「Sure, why not?」

  I pretended to be calm and tilted my glass to the side, then Eve came closer as she held the decanter with both of her hands. She closed the butt length distance between us and we became close enough to each other where our thighs could touch.

   Maybe it’s because she was focused on pouring the drink, she wasn’t on guard about her breasts so I could see her cleavage very clearly. 

  Those breasts that feel like they are at the peak of their growth period indeed look delicious. I want to quickly grab a hold of them.

  「So, how are you doing lately? Anything troubling you?」

  「No. Thanks to you, master, I’m living comfortably」

  「I heard you and Mimon are getting along really well at the innovation association, huh?」

  As I snacked on the assorted fruits from a plate, I placed a hand around Eve’s waist.

  It’s a thin waist that looks like it could easily break. I feel a desire to just grab onto her hips with both of my hands and start thrusting.

  「Yes. Mimon is nice and I really like her」

  Eve answered with a natural smile.

  Then, she started telling me about their interactions in the association without me even asking her as if she was totally fond of Mimon.

  Eve should have seen Mimon’s wild side when she was working as a shadow, but it seems that she still gets along well with her.

  「I see. I’m happy that my Mimon and my Eve are both getting along」

  When I put my hand on Eve’s chin, her face stiffened for a moment, but she closed her eyes right after that and became a maiden who was waiting for a kiss.

  I turned towards her light-colored lips and approached her face.

  「Eve……」

  「Nn, master……」

  I moved the hand I had around her waist to her back, then I pulled her to me with a little bit of force to enjoy a kiss with her.

  「Nnm…*kiss*…mnn*kiss*, *haa*, nnnmm*kiss*…Mnnm, *kiss*, *puahh*, *haa*, nn, master…」

  I released her mouth that I was sucking on and we locked eyes with each other at a distance where the tips of our noses were almost touching.

  Her green colored eyes were slightly watery. It’s probably because she was still rejecting me inside her heart. However, I’m not going to press her about it.

  「You’ve become a good girl. …I like the way you are today」

  「T-thank you」

  The reason Eve became docile all of a sudden was because of the strings I pulled behind the scenes.

  After I parted from her while she was playing with the babies in the babies’ room, I gave some instructions to a servant.

  Then when I called Eve to the bedroom after I ate dinner nonchalantly, she came with a smile on her face.

  Her smile would break at times, but she has been desperately trying to contain her disgust towards me.

  Eve is trying hard to get me to like her right now.

  「I thought you hated me though, Eve…」

  Was that too direct after all? She ended up freezing for a second. However, she denied my claim immediately after that,

  「That’s… not true…I’m very grateful…towards master…」

  Like that, Eve began thanking me. Everything she’s saying is within my expectations.

  As a slave, Eve is treated rather nicely.

  She’s given her own room in the castle and the villa, she wears nice clothes, there is no heavy labor imposed on her, and she also gets to eat until her stomach is full. Considering those living conditions alone, it’s a much better life than her village life.

  And since her master is only me, she only has to have sex with me.

  Since Elf slaves aren’t so cheap that they can be easily bought, I heard that it’s not rare for several men of a family to make a joint purchase together and share.

  Not having to serve several men is a very good situation for an elf slave.

  However, Eve herself didn’t quite understand that.

  It’s also possible that slavery did not exist in her village, so she did not know about slaves in the first place.

  The village she lived in was north of the kingdom. In other words, an undeveloped area that’s located in the great land of the fog.

  It’s too bad but since I never read any documents about the races that live in the great land of fog, I don’t know the details about her home.

  In any case, she lacked a sense of danger as a slave. 

  This morning, when I ordered her to work as a shadow when I have sex with Lupetta, Eve was relieved. 

  I’m sure that she was thinking something like “Ah, he’s not going to do me but someone else. Phew, I’m saved…”

  Even though a sex slave that isn’t having sex with anyone should go straight to a second-hand shop.

  The usefulness of a sex slave is in sex. Them being able to do tasks other than that is merely a bonus.

  I made Eve work as a shadow because I wanted her to be more self-aware as a sex slave.

  Basically, I wanted her to think “He’s not sleeping with me recently…and he’s sleeping with another woman today as well. At this rate, I’m going to be thrown away…”. However, that plan failed spectacularly.

  Me jumping the gun too quickly on taking her in so that I could lose my virginity when she had yet to be educated as a slave was completely my fault, so there’s no one I can even complain to.

  In Eve’s case, not only is she an elf, but she’s also a stunning beauty. She would be worth a lot even if she’s second-hand goods. In fact, Eve’s mother was worth a shockingly high amount even though she is a woman who had already given birth.

  Therefore, it’s highly likely that Eve will be bought by a joint purchase from multiple men next time. If that happens, she will probably be violated every day without rest.

  Since elves have a long lifespan, she will surely be passed on as an heirloom from her master to his son and grandsons, and she will be made to have sex until the day she dies.

  These are just my thoughts, but I think the chances are that she will not have a better life than she currently does after she leaves my hands.

  From her standpoint, she’s much more likely to be happy if she was to make an effort to appeal to me and make me want to sleep with her.

  People will probably grow fond of each other after they sleep with each other a few times. So if that happens, she would probably be cherished much more compared to now.

  Assuming that I will allow her to give birth, she would have a connection with me outside of sex and she will gain stability in her life.

  …Yup, I had a maid of the villa tell those things to Eve.

  To Eve, the old maid that always drops her off at the innovation association is also her teacher who teaches her manners. She was the perfect person to explain Eve’s current situation to her.

  As a result, Eve came to my bedroom to protect her current lifestyle.

  Seeing a simple village girl sell her body in order to survive makes me so excited.

  「…I’m very thankful to you, master. I don’t…hate you…」

  Ehehe, Eve did a fake laugh like that and leaned close to me.

  I think at times like this, pressing her breasts on me would be more effective, but she only touched me a little with her upper arm here.

  As I felt her calculation and her compromise on her disgust from that half-hearted way of leaning in, I started grinning without thinking.

  「I’m happy that you think of me like that」

  I hugged her and stole her lips. I built saliva up on my tongue and poured it into her.

  「Nnm…*suck*, *suck*, Mmmm! *suck*…*slrup*.Nnn…Uu, *kiss*, *pant*, aahh, *pant*, uu…」

  I sought her mouth over and over as if I was making up for all the times I didn’t sleep with her until now. 

  I would suck up all of her saliva and then pour it back to her. Our saliva was being mixed together in our mouths as we used our tongues.

  While I enjoyed the sensation of her breasts that were being pressed on me, I lightly caressed her back, her waist, and her butt.

  「Ah, mm…*kiss*, *haa*, M-mast…mm, nn…*kiss*…*suck*..*kiss*」

 

  Our tongues that were drunk with heat intertwined as a thin layer of sweat formed on our skin.

  It seems that hugging another young body makes things hotter than normal.

  「Eve. You’re adorable」

  「H-hyaaii…」

  I spun Eve who was enduring my continuous kisses around and hugged her from behind.

  With my chin on her shoulder, I have a good view of her cleavage. The view is superb from this angle. 

  Before I realized it, I slipped my index finger into that valley.

  「Hyaa!」

  My finger that was sandwiched between her breasts was enveloped by her soft, slightly sweaty flesh. I feel like the tip of my finger could ejaculate.

  「These are some really nice breasts. For them to have grown that big」

  「…Eeeek……」

  「Don’t worry, I’ll be gentle」

  It’s human nature to want to massage these breasts as hard as I can, but I’m still learning about them, and she says they really hurt when I rub them.

  Since she has taken an obedient attitude today, I want to be good to her as well.

  Let’s trace the curves of her breasts and enjoy their abundance with the palms of my hands. I look forward to seeing just how much those breasts have grown.

  「Uuu…Uuuu…guu……Mn……」

 

  When I touched her body gently like I’m tickling her instead of caressing, Eve leaked out a strange voice.

  Maybe it’s because she’s nervous, her body was very stiff. She might be scared to entrust her body to me.

  I want her to let out a voice that’s a bit cuter.

  「Relax」

  「G-got it…! I’m sorry!」

  From her response that sounded far from being relaxed, I wondered about what I should do.

  Since I’ve been violating her without thinking about her circumstances all this time until now, it’s not unreasonable for her to be on guard.

  It looks like I need to do this carefully.

  「You don’t have to apologize. Alright, let’s head to the bed already」

  I’m tired of this light flirting on the sofa. I want to head to the bed so I can put it in her at any time.

  「Ehh? Kyaa」

  I picked Eve up with a princess carry and moved from the sofa to the bed.

  After I let her down on her back, I immediately laid down next to her. I hugged her like a body pillow and repeatedly gave her many light kisses.

  「Mnn…*kiss*, *kiss*……」

  「Good girl. I’ll be gentle, Eve」

  Since we have moved to the bed, I really want to put my cock in her now. However, if I were to put it in her all of a sudden, she will probably only feel pain as well this time.

  Honestly, when I see her beautiful face, I feel a strong desire to cut out such troublesome stuff and just r*pe her and fill her vagina with cum.

  But I decided to seal the beast within me tonight and take things slowly to get a good taste of her.

  Even though her approaching me was done with her own interest in mind, since she went through the trouble to do all that, I want to teach her the good things about sex here.

  「Oh yeah, I want to hear your thoughts on your job as a shadow. Tell me what was in your mind when you saw the other women」

  Minith, Mimon, and Lupetta. What was on Eve’s mind when she saw those three girls getting fucked by me? I wanted to know.

  「Ehh……?」

  Eve mumbled with her face red up to her ears. From that reaction, I’m guessing she probably felt something other than disgust.

  It’s very fun to sexually harass an innocent girl like her. The desire of wanting to be a father that’s inside me was screaming out telling me to do it more.

  I waited for her response as I continued to touch her body.

  「…Everyone looked like they felt good…」

  「Ohh?」

  According to her, she was surprised that those three girls sounded like they were in ecstasy.

  It seems that she could not understand why those women looked so happy as they received that painful lewd act that she hated.

  I see. Now that she mentions it, I realized that every time I’ve slept with Eve I had only been thinking about feeling good myself.

  「I see, it’s only been painful for you every time, huh?」

  「Ahh……Um, sorry」

  Eve apologized for accidentally letting her true feelings spill out.

  But considering the fact that she’s the same age as me, her erogenous zones are also probably not that developed yet.

  It’s not right to compare her to Minith, Lupetta, and Mimon in the first place.

  「There’s no need for you to apologize」

  Yes, I will thoroughly develop her body from now on.

  I will change her from a girl to a woman. 

  Just from having that thought, I felt my desire to monopolize, control, and conquer her all gush up from my heart.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 88: Savoring the Slave Elf Girl Who Learned to Have A Sense Of Danger (⅔)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To Eve, sex is a pain-filled act that a man forces on a girl.

  That was the case when I took her virginity, and her mother was also gangr*ped by invaders. It’s natural that she would view sex like that.  

  R*ping Eve when she’s screaming out in tears is nice, but I want to get a taste of lovey-dovey sex with her too.

  In order to raise my likability that had hit rock bottom with her, I decided to violate her gently this time.

  「If it hurts, tell me right away」

  「……Okay」

  「I’ll stop immediately when you do, okay?」

  「Okay」

  If I were to really think about what’s best for Eve, I should be teaching her about the good things about sex after her body matures a bit more, but my lower half would not allow it.

  Since my mind is already set on sleeping with her today, it’s impossible to not go through with it now.

  「You’re really cute today Eve. I love it」

  I whispered into Eve’s ear while stroking the back of her head with love as I hugged her like a body pillow. 

  Her long ears that are unique to elves were wiggling in small movements.

  「How do you want it, Eve?」

  「Please, d-don’t make it hurt…」

  Her glistening green eyes that were reflecting the moonlight and those sweet words of hers almost sucked away all of my reasoning unexpectedly.

  「Sure. I’ll be a gentle master tonight」

  Her white slip dress was slightly messed up since she was lying there sideways, and extra glimpses of her youthful skin were showing like she was tempting me. 

  I wonder if this is because of the instincts I have as a male. Saliva was flooding in my mouth like I’m looking at dried plums or something.

  「Come here」

  「Yes master…Nnnn」

  I enjoyed the softness of her lips as we exchanged a light kiss with us lying next to each other.

  Eve did not move as I enjoyed the kiss one-sidedly. She looked like she was waiting for a storm to pass.  

  「Eve, stick your tongue out. Like this」

  After I said that, I stuck my tongue out like a child who was making a taunting face.

  She immediately imitated me and stuck her beautiful pink tongue out.

  「Eeeghh……」

  I gave her tongue one lick from the bottom to the top.

  Unlike when we’re kissing, the fact that I could actually see our tongues overlap increased my excitement.

  Eve shut her eyes tightly and endured the unpleasant feeling of having her tongue licked. However, it’s her turn next.

  「Now, it’s your turn」

  「…Kay」

  I stuck my tongue out as much as I could, and then I waved my tongue at her like I was telling her “come on, come on”

  「I’ll…lick…you now…master…」

  *Squish*, Eve’s small tongue touched the tip of my tongue, and then it started to move up.

  The soft trail that she drew with her tongue was quite ticklish.

  「Mm. Good. Now do it once more. Look at me properly this time」

  「Yes master……」

  Eve’s big eyes opened in front of me. Her eyelashes that were long enough to make me wonder if her face muscles will ache just from her blinking alone were beautiful. 

  I thought she would respond with a look of agony when I told her to look at me, but Eve was forcing herself to smile.

  「Nn…*lick*, fuee……Nnn, *lick*…*lick*…Master…mnnn,*lick*, hyaa…! *lick lick*……」

  Like a dog that was licking its owner’s face, Eve licked my tongue many times.

  While she was doing her best to follow my order, I continued to caress her immature body with my hand.

  She was probably only feeling tickled, but it’s funny how her tongue was trembling occasionally in response to my attacks.

  「Let’s kiss」

  「Hyaa……」

  After I enjoyed the way Eve used her tongue, I initiated a deep kiss with her.

  「*Kiss*…Nn, *suck*, Mnn, puaa, *kiss*, *suck! *Kisss*, *kiss*. *pant*, *pant*」

  「Puaah……*pant*, you taste delicious, Eve. You’re so cute」

  I stroked Eve’s hair as we looked at each other’s faces that were stained with our sticky saliva.

  Her darkened honey-colored hair was sticking to her sweat-covered skin and face erotically.

  「Ahh……I-I’m happy that you are pleased with me, m-master…」

  I stroked through her hair with my fingers like I was combing it, and then I pulled her body into close contact with mine to let her feel my heat.

  Her boobs pressed onto my chest and their shapes changed like they were freshly made mochi.

  「It’s about time we take this off」

  I put my hand on her firm butt and began lifting the hem of her slip dress up.

  What enveloped her cute butt appears to be a pair of white string panties. Those knots by her waist were arousing.

  「Ah……ahh……」

  「Here, lift your body up」

  Since Eve and I are lying down like two reclining buddha statues that are facing each other, her body was sitting on her dress. I was only be able to take her dress off to about the middle area of her back.

   I wrapped a hand around to her back and started to get a good feel of her flawlessly smooth skin with the palm of my hand.

  「*!!!* Eeek……!」

  When I played with the line of her spine, Eve felt tickled and arched her back a bit. I did not miss that moment when her breasts jiggled like jelly.

  「Now, raise your arms」

  I put my tickling play to an end and made Eve raise her arms. Then after I took her dress off and removed her string panties as well, she became fully naked.

  Eve crossed her arms and legs to cover her breasts and hide her private area.

  Since my bulging cock was getting in my way, making it hard for me to take off my pants, I stood up on the bed to fully strip my pajamas off.

  「Uu……」

  As the starlight shined on me through the window, my penis that was wet with pre-cum glittered seductively.

  Eve covered her mouth with her hands and averted her eyes as she remained lying down on the bed.

  「Try giving it a touch」

  I crouched down in front of Eve, and then I made her touch this thing that will be going inside her.

  My cock was trembling slightly, perhaps it’s because a large amount of blood had flowed there because Eve touched it with her hand.

  「Woahh…It’s hot……」

  「This thing is different from a baby boy’s, right? Try taking a closer look」

  Eve listened to my order obediently. She did things like checking for my cock’s elasticity by gripping its shaft with her fingers and poking at my balls. It felt kind of good.

  Since she is used to taking care of children, she might have seen a young boy’s penis before, but as I thought, she has never gotten a close look at an erect cock that is waiting to mate.  

  The act of showing an innocent girl my cock came with a strange pleasure. I ended up understanding just a little bit about how a trench coat flasher feels.

  「Now it’s your turn to let me take a good look at you」

  I lay back down on the bed with my cock still in her hands. What was in front of me as I lay there was not Eve’s face, but her crotch area instead.

  With us in the position of a pair of 69ing reclining buddha statues, I touched her inner thigh.

  「……Master, p-please…don’t look…it’s embarrassing…」

  She closed her legs tightly. Only a bit of her pubic hair was visible.

 

  「Eve, open your legs up」

  I moved my hips and thrusted my cock that was in front of her eyes to insist that she show it to me.

  Then I buried my face into her crotch as it slowly opened up, and our lovemaking with tongues and fingers began.

  「*…*……! Ahhh, haa…NoOO, *ku…*…!……」

  As I kissed her inner thighs over and over, I ran my tongue up to her pelvis area. I attacked those outer areas of her vagina slowly and carefully so that I will never come into contact with her vagina’s lips. 

  Since Eve would shut her legs right away if I’m careless, I had one of my hands on one of her legs and another hand holding her other leg open. 

  Perhaps it’s because she was enduring my caressing, her grip on my cock was getting stronger. The feeling was quite pleasant.

  「Mn……*Kiss*」

  After teasing her for some time, I aimed at her tightly shut vagina lips and kissed them gently.

  As I smelled the air that was somewhat damp but did not stink, I kissed her there repeatedly.

  「…!」

  She suddenly grabbed my cock tightly.

  When I put my tongue on her small clitoris that was covered by its hood near her vagina, she reacted with slow movements that did not look like she was in pain. The slight saltiness it had was delicious.  

  「…*ku*, *haaa*, *haaa*……*pant*……*pant*……*haaa*…!…*ku*……*pant*…*pant*…Haa, ahhhh, nooo……」

  Slowly, I took my time and got a good taste of her pussy, literally.

  If this scene was seen by someone outside, they would see a fully naked young boy and girl doing 69. That thought alone seems to have ignited a fire in me. If there were video cameras in this world I would be able to enjoy this scene later, but it’s a shame there aren’t any.

  Me getting pointlessly excited from imagining myself seeing this scene from a 3rd person point of view and the stimulation of lust from going down on her seem to have put me into a trance.

  By the time I realized it, I had messed with Eve with my tongue and fingers for quite some time.   

  「Ahhh……*sniff*, *haa*, uu, Uu, uuu…*sniff*…Uuuu. Uee…*sniff*……」

  I meant to attack her with as much saliva as possible so that it wouldn’t hurt her, but Eve was already on the verge of crying.

  She tightened the grip on my cock as the sound of her sniffing echoed in the room.

  「……Eve? Does it hurt?」

  「*Sniff*…Uu, *sniff*…It-it doesn’t hurt…Sh-shorry…*Sob*, Uuuu……」

  I stopped tonguing her lower body and reversed my body’s position to look at Eve face to face.

  Her face and ears were really red and she was in tears.

  「I told you that I would stop if you just tell me that it hurts, didn’t I?」

  However, Eve shook her head as she remained face down and denied my words.

  「It doesn’t hurt……」

  「Then why are you crying? Answer me honestly. I’ll be angry if you lie」

  Eve looked like she was trying to read my expression, and then she answered in a quiet voice.

  「Because, *sob*…it’s ticklish, it makes me itchy, and it feels…gross…It was making me feel weird…*sob*…*sniff*……」

  Rather than pain, I think she was feeling grossed out by a feeling that she does not know about. Since it’s her first time being caressed this gently, her body and mind were probably confused.

  「You have done well in answering me honestly. Let’s call it here for today then」

  「Really?」

  「Yes, really. The licking is over」

  I whispered after I hugged Eve like I was pacifying a crying child.

  Eve doesn’t seem like she feels any sexual excitement yet, but her body that had been getting caressed repeatedly had been getting ready to welcome a man in its own way.

  Her vagina is also really wet due to my saliva, so it shouldn’t be hard to get it in if I were to put it in her right now. 

  「……Master……?」

  「I’ll take good care of you, my Eve」

  When I hugged her strongly, Eve’s body stiffened as she probably sensed that the mood had changed. 

  She looked down, and then she looked up at me again.  

  The expression on her face was a forced smile that was really poorly done.

  When I pulled Eve in closer with my hand around her shoulder, she leaned on me without resisting.

  I placed my hand on her chin, then I thought about what kind of sex position I want to try while I kissed her.

  As I looked at her lying there next to me like a reclining Buddha, it made me want to put it in her while she sleeps and take my time to have my way with her.

  「Eve. You can go to sleep」

  With her limbs extending out, Eve was in a pose like a cat that was lying down.

  I wrapped around her and glued myself to her body from behind.

  「*Kiss*」

  「Nnn……」

  When I put my lips on Eve’s nape, I felt her back shudder.

  I tried to determine the location of her vagina’s entrance while I massaged her butt to loosen it up, but it was quite hard to find the insertion spot.

  This time, I am thinking about challenging the spooning position. “Those who have no ambition in bed are idiots”- I feel like that’s what the people who like sex would say in my past life.

  「Uuu……uuu……」

  Maybe she is scared of taking in my cock? Eve leaked out a shaky voice as she covered her face with her hands.

  I lifted her thigh up with my hand and determined the location of her vagina, and then I tried to touch her there just a little with the tip of my bulging cock. 

  Since I only gauged the location by where my hand is on her thigh, I am worried if my cock is really at her vagina’s entrance.  

  「Ah……」

  She probably thought that being touched by my cock means that it’s going to go into her, so she tucked her chin in like she was trying to endure the pain. 

  When I put my hand around where her heart would be, I could feel her heart thumping from her breast.

  「Eve. Don’t worry. Just tell me if it hurts」

  「O-okay……」

  Perhaps her ear was stimulated by my breath, Eve tucked her chin in further, and her body started to get really stiff.

  That reminds me, recently I have been wondering if her ears are her weak points.

  Eve’s elf ears are right in front of me when we’re in this position where I’m hugging her from behind. It’s a position that’s truly easy for me to attack in.

  「Ahhm」

  「HiiaaaAAAAAAh?!」

  When I gave her ear a nibble to see what would happen, Eve responded with a really big reaction to shake me off. It looks like she’s indeed quite weak there.

  Maybe it’s because of the intense stimulation from the ear nibbling that had run through her, her entire body relaxed when I released her ear. This is my chance. I quickly pushed my cock towards her vagina’s opening. 

  「I’m putting it in」

  Without waiting for her reply, I pushed my cock in just slightly until the tip was in.

  The inside of Eve’s vagina that is hot and squirming enveloped the tip of my cock as if it was telling me to hurry and give it my semen.

  「Mmn……」

  「Does it hurt?」

  My desire to just give in to my lust and start thrusting almost overflowed, but I managed to somehow keep myself under control and not move.

  「I’m…okay…」

  「I see. You can tell me at anytime if it hurts, okay?」

  I slowly pushed my hips forward and continued to go deeper a little at a time.

  「Nn. ……Mnn……*pant*……Mmn……ugghh, mnn…!……」

  As for Eve, it looks like her body was fairly ready for it after all since she doesn’t look like she is in that much pain.

  Until I reached the point where I couldn’t go in any deeper, Eve was leaking out a voice that was closer to groaning rather than moaning, but she didn’t sound like she was having that tough of a time either.

  Since we’re in this position and I can’t move my hips to my desires, slow sex might just be the suitable move here. By tightly sticking to her from behind, I felt fulfilled in my heart.

  「Eve, it’s all in」

  「O…kay…!, *pant*, *haa*…!…」

  Eve’s shoulders trembled as she inhaled and exhaled deeply.

  Once I stopped moving in the state where my cock is the deepest it can be, I could feel that her pussy was quickly contracting and expanding in response to the invasion of a foreign object.

  I feel like I want to just stay still and feel the shape of her vagina.

  「How is it, Eve? Do you feel me inside you?」

  「!…Y-yes. …Master’s thing is…amazing, ughh…! It’s…t-thick…and…in-intense…」

    I’m happy that her immature pussy welcomed my reproductive tool so I patted her on the head.

  「Good girl, Eve. We can just stay connected like this」

  Since I’m hugging her from behind, it’s a position that seems like it’ll work well for caressing.

  I licked her sweaty nape, and then I lightly applied pressure on her clitoris with my fingers as I enjoyed her reaction.

  「!……AH! Uu……!……*haa*, Master……Ah……!!……*Haa*, *haa*, *haaaa*……*pant*……」

  My cock that was being firmly held was squeezed tightly by her feverish vaginal walls.

  Eve was probably not aware of it, but to me, it was an attack that felt good enough to make me almost cum from that alone.

  「Eve. Relax a little more」

  Even though I told her that, it was probably a hard order for her to follow since she was enduring my cock inside of her.

  I caught her long elf ear with my lips and slowly ran my tongue on it.

  「*Hiiiiiii*! *Hiii*! S-STO-! AHHHhhhhhh, NO, NO, NOOoo!」

  Eve’s back arched and the back of her head collided with my collarbone area.

  Her breasts that shook greatly from that impact looked so delicious. It’s such a shame that I can’t suck on them from this position.

  Her pussy would get really tight when I lick her ear, and it would relax immediately when I stop. Those vaginal movements felt so good that it made my brain feel all fuzzy, putting me into a trance as my tongue danced with her ear.

  「Hyaaaa! NOOooo! N-NOoo! Ahh! Ahhh! M-master! Ah-ahhhhhh! Mnnnaaahh! *Hi, haaa*, *haaa*, Uuu ♡ Ahh, ahhh! Mnnnnuuuu!」

  Was the pleasure too strong? Eve grabbed my arm and began resisting.

  I could no longer afford to caress her with my fingers so I suppressed her struggles by hugging her.

  Since my cock seems like it will slip out if this struggle continues, I could only put a stop to my attacks on her ears. 

  「Ughh…! *Pant*, *pant*, *pant*……Uu……*Sob*……Ueeeehh……Mother……Uuuu……」

  Eve looked so erotic and adorable after she started to cry with my cock still inside her.

  I stuck my body that had become a little distanced from hers up against her again. I felt like we were able to bind to each other without leaving any space between us thanks to our sweat.

  「Eve. I’m sorry for being so mean to you」

  Even though I said that I was going to be gentle this time, I ended up making her shed many tears in the end.

  As the heir of a marquis, it would normally be unacceptable for me to apologize to a sex slave, but it’s a different story when we’re in the bedroom. I apologized to her honestly.

  「*Sob*…M-master……?」

  「I’m sorry, Eve. I said that I was going to be gentle, and yet it ended up a lie」

  Eve seemed really surprised when I apologized to her.

  Come to think of it, I don’t recall ever apologizing when I r*ped her either.

  In her mind, she might see me as an arrogant and snotty human being. Although from her point of view, that’s not exactly wrong.

  「I couldn’t control myself because I love you, Eve. Forgive me」

  Without doing any weird caressing, I whispered to her as I simply hugged her tightly.

  「………Okay……」

  The way she gave a small nod in response made her look so precious.

  “I want to make everything about this girl mine.” Such desire started to spring up inside me.

  Even though I’m not moving my hips, my desire to ejaculate was rapidly rising, and I felt my cock getting so hard that it was shocking even to me.

  「Eve……!」

  「……Y-yes?」

  With a sudden jerk, I pushed my hips like I was going to her deepest part with my cock.

  「I’m going to give you the baby essences now…! Accept them…!」

  「……Ehh?!」

  「I’ll turn you into a mother, so give birth to a cute baby for me…!」

  I became excited from my own line, and my semen began to surge out vigorously.

  「Ahh……Ahh………!」

  「You like babies, don’t you……? Eve……Ahh! Eve! It’s coming out! Ughhh……!」

  「Ah, AHHHHHhhhhhh……」

  There’s no doubt that Eve was thinking that resisting me or something like that is already not an option.

  She also knows that this is the right move for her. Accepting my semen, becoming pregnant, and then giving birth to a child would make her the happiest.

  That voice of hers that sounded like she had given up aroused me, letting me walk my last steps towards ejaculation.

  「Evee! I’m cumming! Take it all in! Ughhhh!!」

  「Ah………ahh………」

  *Spurt*! *Spurttt*, *spurrtt*! 

  My seeds blew out deeply towards Eve’s deepest and most precious place. 

  *Spurrtt*! *Spurrtt*! *Spurt*!

  As if that wasn’t enough, the leftover semen shot out bit by bit in addition, seeking for her eggs.

  *Drip*…*drip*……*drip*……

  Then, the rest of my body fluid started to drip out like it was piss to claim her as mine.  

  「Eve……Ahhh……Eve……」

  「………Mas…ter……」

  I called out to her as she continued to take in my semen and we kept on clinging to each other without severing our connection.

  Until the moment my consciousness sunk into the depths of darkness, I continued to seek Eve’s presence.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 90: Afterglow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I have been sucking on Eve’s tits while I immersed myself in the afterglow of our mating.

  She is obediently letting me do what I want as she remained in the position that dogs or cats would be in when they breastfeed. 

  My cock had already fallen out, but most of the semen did not spill out from her vagina. I was sure that I had let out a lot from how it felt.

  Since I did not hump her intensely, the semen might be just sticking to the inside of her vagina.

  Although I do love the sight of white liquid dripping out from a vagina because it’s lewd, it doesn’t seem like I’ll be able to witness it this time.

  「*Suck*……Eve, ahm. *suck*, *suck*……」

  「Mn……」

  I’m being considerate of Eve who has sensitive breasts, so I’m not going to do things like pulling them or sucking on them with all my strength.

  I’m only going to give her tits play-bites with my lips and gentle sucks while making sucking noises.

  These big lumps of warm and soft meat really put me at ease. I feel like even if I died like this I would have no regrets.

 

  「I wonder if we were able to make a child」

  「……I…don’t know……」

  I touched Eve’s snow-white stomach softly and thought about my seeds that had settled inside there. They are probably working hard searching for her eggs right now.

  「Mnnchuu, *suck*……Ahmm, *suck*……Nm」

  「Ah, master…n-nothing is going to come out even if you…」

  Eve’s udders are big enough to fill my palms, but the only thing that had come out so far when I sucked on them was her moans.

  But nevertheless, I was still drunk on the pleasure of sucking on them.

  Since the sex this time was done with just a little bit of consideration for her, it’s probably okay for me to act this spoiled.

  We have a scene of a boy who is still 12 years old sucking on the breasts of a girl of the same age. Oh, how immoral and wonderful this is.

  My withered cock seems like it was coming back alive from that thought alone, but maybe since me sucking on these symbols of motherhood calms me down, it settled with a half erection.  

  「Yeah you’re right, nothing will come out yet」

  「……Yeah」

  After I gave her nipple that was rolling on my tongue a kiss, I took my mouth off her nicely developed chest.

  As I felt a sense of satisfaction from seeing her chest dyed in my saliva, I moved my body to kiss her lips next.

  「Nnn……*slurp*, *kiss*, *kiss*, *pant*, *kiss*, *kisskiss*, *Puahh*, *haah*, *pant*……」

  「*Kiss*! ……Eve, I’m really happy today」

  I slowly exhaled while I touched Eve’s cheeks.

  Not only did I get to enjoy her body plenty, but I was also truly satisfied with the “play” I did tonight.

  Eve looks like she was already completely exhausted, so she has been leaving that bitter smile on her face as it is.

  I could feel that she had given up like she’s just going to let whatever happens happen.

  「Let’s go to sleep like this together」

  The bed didn’t really get that messed up today, so I decided to sleep here as it is.

  I snuggled up to Eve who remained lying down, and then I put the blanket on us.

  I held onto her hand under the blanket like how a couple would lewdly lock their fingers together.

  「You can take a day off work tomorrow」

  「……Okay. Thank you, master……」

  I decided to talk to Eve since my excitement has yet to go away.

  As I caressed her head, brushed her hair with my fingers, and gave her light kisses occasionally, I continued to talk about the same things in a trance.

  The topic shifted from the work she’s doing recently to the work at the innovation association, and then to the babies who she will be taking care of in the villa for some time.

  「For some time……? Are those babies going to end up going somewhere?」

  「Yeah. As soon as we decide on their caretakers, they’ll probably be sent off」

  「I…see…」

  Eve said in a very sad tone.

  She seems quite emotionally invested from interacting with them for only about half a day.

  「What? You really came to like those babies, huh?」

  「……Yeah」

  「Alright alright. ……Don’t worry, soon you’ll be able to have a baby too so you won’t be lonely」

  I rubbed her stomach and smiled at her.

  Since I have zero intention to use contraceptives, Eve will probably become pregnant eventually. She should not be lonely for long.

  「Um……」

  「What is it?」

  Eve opened her mouth with an uneasy expression on her face.

  「Um, my mother said that…it would be really bad if I got pregnant at my age」

  Perhaps she had already given up about not getting impregnated, she seems to be worrying about giving birth now.

  In the continent of Elluo, giving birth is a dangerous event that could cost your life.

  Since medical technology here is not developed like it was on Earth in my previous life, one breech delivery for an average citizen can very likely kill both the mother and the child. 

  Despite that, people still marry at a young age, so cases of people dying when giving birth are not uncommon at all.

  It’s not like I collected any data, but if there was a ranking list for the cause of death for the citizens of Nyuneri, I feel like deaths related to giving birth would be very high on the list for females.

  「There’s no need to worry」

  However, that only applies to normal citizens.

  If there’s a healer who’s a pregnancy/childbirth specialist helping you, the risk of dying from that is pretty much 0%.   

  When a rich person’s wife becomes pregnant, the person would save up their kiris gold coins to ask for a healer’s support. And if it’s a wife of a noble, personal healers would be mobilized.

  By the way, a person’s magic power supposedly becomes unstable during pregnancy.

  Since magic power is what gives a person the resilient life force that draws the line between people with magic power and normal people, without a healer, even if the woman is a noble, she could end up dead if unlucky. 

  For that reason, it’s essential to have excellent healers in order to keep your house’s lineage going.

  「We have good healers here, so there’s no way you will die」

  The house of Qualdense has many dedicated healers. Among them, there are healers who specialize in pregnancy and childbirth as well. 

  In order for our healers who specialize in pregnancy to not become rusty, they are usually sent out to the homes of knights who work for us in many cases. Since that allows the knights’ families to give birth regularly, it works out well for everybody.  

  And while this is obvious, as the hier of the house of Qualdense, childbirth events that are related to me will have the highest priority.  

  If my women were to give birth, our specialist healers will obviously be expected to be with them. And of course, “my women” includes Eve as well.

  I did not plant my seeds in this young girl who is in her growth period without thinking about anything.

  「……That’s how it is. That’s why you can rest assured, Eve」

  「I-I see……」

  Even though all elves possess magic power, I wonder if her village didn’t have anyone who could use healing magic.

  I tried to ask her about it, but she said she didn’t really know.

  「Don’t elves possess a lot of magic power? You should be able to use healing magic……」

  In the true scripture of Xessianism, it’s said that elves which are described as “A race that lives with spirits” is a race that possesses a large amount of magic power.

  If there wasn’t even a single elf who could use healing magic in her village, then I guess her village had nothing but small fries.

  Maybe that’s why it was destroyed by the kingdom’s expedition forces on the side.

   「Sorry…I don’t know the answer to that……」

  「No, it’s fine. …I asked because I don’t really know that much about elves. Tell me about yourself」

  There are very few documents out there that are about elves.

  Where do they live? What kind of life do they live? What is their culture like? Most of those questions are pretty much unanswered.

  Some say that a lot of them are living in the great land of fog, but even that is just a rumor with no proof in the end.

  In actuality, there are sighting reports of elves all over the continent.

  「Umm..」

  I told her to tell me about herself, but it seems like she was troubled over where to begin.

  It might have been better if I started with some small talk.

  「Alright, I want you to tell me about the things you liked about your village」

  「……Understood」

  And then, Eve started to tell me about what life was like in her village.

  The more she talked, the more her voice started to shake, and tears started to gradually come out of her green eyes.

  Until about 2 or 3 months ago, she was living peacefully in her hometown village with her family. She probably became sad from thinking about the things that she had lost as she talked about her memories.  

  I was listening to her silently, but I thought to myself that I screwed up.

  「Uuue…*Sobbb*…T-then, m-mother, she…*sniff*…Uuue, mother, and father…Uuuuue……」

  Even though I wanted this to be a happy conversation, she sobbed as tears continued to flow down.

  When I tried to gently caress her head, she went under the blanket and curled up.

  As I looked at the slightly trembling blanket, my feelings died down as well.

  「Eve, that’s enough. Just take a good rest」

  「……Okay……」

  After giving her permission to sleep, I cut off the illumination magic.  

  I thought about her in this room that had become pitch black.

  After a while, she probably thought that I fell asleep, so she started to wiggle around. 

  As I pretended to be asleep without going as far as making any sleeping sounds, Eve distanced herself a little from me, then she turned her back to me and went to sleep.

  It seems that I’m still unliked. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 91: Departure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When I woke up, Eve was sleeping at the edge of the bed. She looked like she would fall off if she rolled just one more time.

  The sight of her abundant breasts sticking out while she’s lightly snoring like a child is truly erotic.

  I will tell my servants that I’m up after I enjoy giving her two small licks as she sleeps.

  Since I’m leaving for Nambonan today, the number of servants seems to have increased. The atmosphere felt quite hectic around here.

  I called for the servants who are in charge of helping me change while I made sure to not wake Eve up, and then I headed to the dining room after I got dressed.

  In the middle of my meal, Tesh came and reported to me that preparations for departure had finished.  

  As he talked to me about today’s schedule, the door of the dining room was knocked on.

  「Good morning, young master」

  A maid came in and bowed after she said that.

  The way she was walking briskly in the new style of maid outfits that I came up with gave off a feeling of a capable female that was quite nice.

  This time, the team that is going to go to Nambonan with me to serve me is going to consist of Tesh and this woman named Odie.  

  Even though Odie doesn’t have the title, she’s practically the vice head maid. She has been on a business trip at a residence in the royal capital with mother until now.

  「It’s been a long time since I was under your care, Odie. I’ll be counting on you」

  「Yes sir. I will devote myself to meet your requests」

  Odie should be around 25 years old right now. The vibe of a capable “career woman” is so nice that I can’t get enough of it.

  Back when I was a baby, my favorite servant was Odie.

  She was still around Eve’s age at the time. Due to her serious personality, she was a young girl that always looked tense.

  I remember she was so cute the way she nervously interacted with me, the long-awaited son of the Qualdense family.

  But now she has the dignified aura of a veteran maid, and I can feel her confidence in her eyes as she looked at me.

  「I want to depart right away after I finish my after-meal tea. There’s no problem, right?」

  Tesh and Odie then both answered me in affirmation at the same time.

  Last time, I went to Nambonan city as a soldier, but this time, I’m going there to look around as the ruler.

  Therefore, I am going there leisurely and elegantly in a horse carriage instead of rushing there on horseback.

  Warhorses here have the same image as the ones from Earth in my past life, but the horses that pull carriages are a bit different.

  They are chubby, big-boned horses and huge horses with thick, hairy manes. These types of horses certainly did not exist on Earth. I know this because these horses are bigger than elephants.

  They are creatures that make me question if it’s even okay to call them horses still.

  「Odie, you’re coming to Nambonan with us after you just came back from the capital, huh? It must be tough to travel everywhere like this」

  「Thank you for your concern. However, I’m okay because I’m already used to it」

  Tesh is the one who is driving the carriage while Odie and I were swaying around inside the carriage that’s about as roomy as the inside of a minivan.

  Since it’s a type of carriage that could fit 6 people, she had the option to sit next to me as well, but Odie was sitting at the spot that is the furthest away from me.

  That’s because she’s trying to be as reserved as possible as a servant. By no means am I being hated or anything like that.

  「Oh and I’m happy that I could finally see your face after so long」

  「Is that so? And what do you think after seeing this face? Have I become a charming man?」

  Odie’s work expression broke into a smile. It was a natural smile that showed her affection.

  My morning wood that has yet to completely subside reacted with a twitch. 

  「Yes. Mother has said that as well. I think you have become quite handsome and manly」

  Odie’s mother is the head maid.

  Naturally, that means Odie should also know that I have graduated from being a virgin.

  「I-I see」

  I started to feel embarrassed after all this time about the fact that Odie knows that I lost my virginity.

  Since she had always looked after me as I grew up, she’s the person who has touched me the most out of all the maids.

  Our conversation cut off temporarily, and only the sound of the carriage’s movements echoed quietly.

  By the way, while I do have my “studies” to learn about women, my target range only includes my personal maids, maids who aren’t designated to anyone, and female commoners. When it comes to my father’s, mother’s, grandfather’s, and Fanny’s personal maids, I cannot put my hands on them unless I have their master’s permission. 

  What I’m curious about here is where Odie stands in this. On the surface, she’s not anybody’s personal maid, but from the work she does, I could say that she’s both my father and mother’s personal maid. She’s in a weird category where I don’t know if I can put my hands on her or not.

  If I can, I want to try hitting on her and take her to my bed, then shoot tons in her with my libido that exceeds a 12-year-old’s. I want to show her the manly side of her grown-up young master and shake off these feelings of embarrassment I have.

  I want to ask Tesh about this, but sadly, he’s driving the horse carriage right now.

  「Young master? May I help you with anything?」

  「No, it’s nothing」

  Since I was staring at Odie, it seems that she thought I needed something.

  I immediately denied it and looked at the scenery outside the window.

  We have already left the city of Nyuneri as a peaceful plain continues to expand in my sight. 

When I looked into the distance, a large river was sparkling as it reflected the sunlight.

  At any rate, the carriage was going slow like I thought it was.

  Tesh and Odie seem to be using magic to raise the horses’ stamina, but the horses probably can’t really speed up because of the situation we’re in.

  Our carriage is being surrounded by our escorts who are tagging along on horses, but they have been moving at a very relaxed pace. 

  It looks like it’s still going to take a while before we arrive at Nambonan city.

  We arrived at the city of Evermill around the time dusk began to fall as our surroundings started to be dyed black.

  Since it’s impossible to get to Nambonan city in one day, we are lodging on the way as planned.

  The city of Evermill is a city that’s surrounded by walls the same way the city of Nyuneri is.

  When we approached the city’s gates, the people in the Knight family-The House of Evermill came out to welcome us all together. Knight families generally have a lot of family members, so there were quite a lot of people gathered.

  Knights are subordinates of major nobles, and they manage territories that the nobles they serve possess. In other words, they act as local governors.

  Our family, the Qualdense, doesn’t really have that much land for a marquis of the Levios Kingdom, but we possess a few well-developed cities like these. Our territories have quality rather than quantity.

  ……Well, our lands have increased as well in the last few years thanks to grandfather’s efforts though.

  Anyway, since there’s no way our family can manage all those lands, we are indirectly managing them through the knights who serve us.

  Knights are allowed to use their family name to represent themselves as the lords of those lands, and they are allowed to have their children succeed them. With that, no matter how many generations go by, those lands will be controlled by the family members of those knights, making them a “Knight family”.

  There are documents in the data library of Nyuneri city that say the house of Evermill has governed the city of Evermill for about 100 years. They are one of the ancient knight families that supported the house of Qualdense. 

  「Master Wilk! Thanks for coming here! I bet you’re tired, right? We will prepare a meal and ready a bath for you immediately. Please come to the castle」

  「Yeah. It’ll be my pleasure」

  The head of the Evermill family, knight Evermill, is a man who looks to be in his 30s. 

  As I watched him energetically give orders to his servants and family members from the side, we entered the city and headed towards the castle with their guidance.

  Although it’s called a castle, it’s not like the castle in Nyuneri. Their castle was more like a one-story building that looked similar to a samurai mansion. 

  My grandmother Cassia had once fought against a magic beast on this land and passed away after that.  

  The speed of rumors appears to travel faster than horses, as the citizens of Evermill were all yelling out to congratulate me with great excitement.

  Even though their city wasn’t the one that got attacked by the magic beast, they looked delighted as if they were the people who got saved. I guess there are probably still people from the generation that still remember the time a magic beast attacked their city.

  Even Knight Evermill was glancing over at me with a face that says he wants to ask about me the magic beast subjugation as well. 

  The knights in our territories are divided mainly into 2 types. The meathead type and the type that acts behind the scenes. Judging from his overly enthusiastic personality, his machoness, and how he’s anxiously looking forward to hearing about the magic beast subjugation, Knight Evermill looks to be the former type.  

  By the way, most of the knights in our territories are the type who act behind the scenes. The reason for that is because their lord’s family has the type of nobles who specialize in plotting behind the scenes. 

  In order to protect the Qualdense’s territories that are located almost in the middle of the continent, we need to have the skill to play our cards right in the noble’s society. We probably became nobles with such nature as a result of that. 

  I’ve heard from Viscount Galliana before about how my father is good at doing shady deals, information warfare, and plotting schemes. He said that my father who loves to talk about erotic stuff had a charming public face like a two-faced snake.

  It’s perfectly fitting since the Qualdense family’s emblem has a snake drawn on there.

  After we entered the castle, I was immediately guided to the dining area.

  Since the city of Evermill is developing into one of the most developed cities in our territory, they have prepared food that can match what I normally eat.

  「I want to truly extend my congratulations to you on your magic beast subjugation. I’ve never heard of anyone accomplishing something like that overnight. Even the people of Evermill are overjoyed to hear your success as if it was our own」

  「What, that was nothing to me」

  If this was my previous life, it would have probably been better to be a little humble here, but considering my position right now it would be better for me to be proud about it.

  I began to boast about this time’s subjugation with an attitude that’s not too overly arrogant.

  The eyes of Knight Evermill’s children and relatives were also sparkling as they listened to my magic beast subjugation story.

  「Woww! That’s wonderful!」

  Among them, there are some girls who seem pretty fuckable as well, but again, the question was if it would be okay for me to put my hands on them.

  However, I’m not shameless enough to ask Tesh “That girl, is it okay if I sleep with her?” on the spot while he’s serving me food.

  My father ordered me strictly to not put my hands on any daughters of nobles. However, since it was unlikely for me to venture out to other nobles’ territories, I wouldn’t have many chances to come in contact with daughters of nobles in the first place.

  There aren’t many chances to meet with daughters of nobles in our territories either. There are the empire’s female captives who are in Nyuneri’s prison camp, Plume, who sometimes comes here to hangout from the Silopea’s territory, the daughters of the knight families, and that’s about it.

  After my grandfather killed the empire’s nobles, he kidnapped their brides and daughters and threw them in the prison camp. Since even I know that things would get complicated if I laid my hands on these captives, I never even went to the prison camp before. If I don’t play it safe and there happen to be beauties there who I can’t put my hands on, my stress will pile up.

  Putting my hands on Plume is even more out of the question than getting a taste of those captives. Even if I put my hands on the captives, I could at least handle the matter internally. But if I put my hands on Plume, it would be difficult to talk my way out of things and it will be a problem related to each other’s marriage. “Yes” to admiring Plume, but “No” to touching her.  

  And then the daughters of knight families that I don’t know the answer to; I can’t say for sure whether or not they fit the criteria of “nobles” that my father refers to. Technically they aren’t, but in a broader sense they are. Knight families are in such a grey area. 

  I don’t see any problems with me having sex with them right now, but I don’t know for sure.

  「The magic beasts from Nyuneri are pretty strong once matured…! To clean one up in just one night……」 

  As I scanned for beauties around me, I continued to talk about the magic beast.

  I heard rumors before that say daughters of the knight families are used to having sex and good at doing fetish plays. Isn’t it normal human nature to want to find out if rumors are true?

  After the meal, I took a hot bath and waited for Tesh in the room that was prepared for me as my bedroom.

  「If it’s the knight families that serve us, master has told me ahead of time to tell you that you can do as you like」  

  「I see」

  「If you let me know who you want, I will make the arrangements」

  While it’s okay to suddenly attack them from behind, it seems that I can also use my authority to call them to my bedroom.

  If they are daughters of the knight families, their parents will probably simply send them to me if I say that I want to sleep with them.

  Then, I thought about who I want to try sleeping with, but due to the long day of traveling tiring me out more than I expected, my desire to sleep was stronger. 

  It’s probably good to voluntarily prohibit myself from women once in a while too.

  After Tesh left my room, I turned off the illumination magic and closed my eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 92: Origins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Since I wasn’t used to the bed and the pillow, I woke up before the sun came up.

  Now that I was wide awake, it wouldn’t do anything even if I continued to stay wrapped in the blanket.

  When I exited my bedroom, there was a maid who seemed to be a servant of the house of Evermill sitting on a chair by the entrance of my room.

  After she saw me appear in my pajamas, she lowered her head to me as if she was apologetic and said good morning to me in a flustered manner.

  Right when I wanted to ask her if Tesh or Odie were up yet, I heard a familiar voice coming from down the hallway. I could hear laughter as well; there was a happy vibe in the air.

  That voice came closer as I looked at the maid of the Evermill family who was standing there with a red face. 

  「Ohh it’s young master, good morning」

  「Young master, I apologize for my brief absence」

  The people who walked up were a man who was tasked to guard me and Odie.

  「I only woke up a second ago. Don’t worry about it」

  Since it isn’t just Tesh and Odie who are taking care of me this time, it’s natural that she would be away from her post at times.

  While I showed a carefree attitude, I gave Odie a glance.

  What I wanted to do was conveyed to her through just that one glance, and Odie went to get a change of clothes for me after a bow.  

  Then, she soon returned to the bedroom with a set of clothes as if they had already been prepared beforehand. 

  「Excuse me」

  Odie took my pajamas off and started to help me change.

  Even when she saw my magnificent morning erection, she helped me fit that into my pants without panicking at all.

  「What were you doing in the hallway earlier?」

  I tried asking her as she stood in front of me while helping me tidy up my top.

  Odie sounded really happy when she was talking to the male guard, so I became a bit curious.

  「You mean just now? We were just having a small chat……?」

  Odie said that without much emotion on her face, but despite that, she seemed really close to him.

  Odie is married so she even has a husband. It’s possible that I had just witnessed her being unfaithful. If she’s going to cheat, I think it would be better if it’s with me.

  When I casually warned her like ”Ohh you shouldn’t cheat, you know?”, she smiled.

  「Young master, that was my older brother. And as one might expect, I don’t want to have my brother’s child」

  「Ah, so that was your older brother」

  As I tried to recall the face of the guard who I thought of that way, I realized that he did kind of resemble Odie. 

  The color of his hair was also red like the leaves in autumn, so I do believe it if she says they are siblings.

  「Yes. It’s been a long time since I met my older and younger brother, so I was talking to them just now」

  「Younger brother?」

  「One of my younger brothers is also serving you as a guard」

  When I was told that, the faces of those who could be her younger brother surfaced in my mind.

  He should also have red-colored hair like Odie and her older brother.

  That was when I became curious about something.

  「Hohh, it’s rare to have siblings with magic power who are close in age. With 3 of you possessing magic power, your family is set for life」

  Since all my guards are humans who possess magic power, that would obviously mean that Odie’s brothers possess magic power as well.

  In the continent of Elluo, magic power is something that can “pay your bills”, so there are a lot of studies done on it.

  I have read some documents about the inheritance of magic power before.

  According to what I read, the humans who live in the continent of Elluo could be divided into 3 or 4 types. 

  The 3 types are Master origin, Servant origin, and Slave origin.

  Since it’s not clear if the last type of Legendary origin exists, it has been omitted by most of the documents.

  The Master origin basically refers to the nobles.

  People of the master origin possess a huge amount of magic power since birth, and as they mature, that amount will continue to increase.

  They practically can’t get sick, and they have resilient vitality that would allow them to survive until they starve to death even if the lower half of their body was blown off.

  People like my father, mother, grandfather, and Fanny are humans who belong to this category.

  The Servant origin, although this may sound bad, refers to people who possess a low level of magic power.

  They were born with magic power, but compared to people of the master origin, the amount of magic power they have is abysmal.

  They also possess bodies that are pretty much immune to sickness, but they cannot survive if their lower body gets blown off.

  People like Lupetta, Mergin, my guards, Odie, and the knights of the Evermill family belong to this category.

  The Slave origin just refers to the people who have no magic power. They are the closest beings to the humans from my past life.

  In the continent of Elluo, they are protected and ruled by the people of master and servant origin; they are humans who live their life as commoners.

  「……No, all 5 of my older brothers and both of my younger brothers possess magic power」

  Odie spoke in a quiet voice.  

  That way of responding was pretty much her saying “That’s my response if you heard it, but it’s a topic I don’t really want to talk about”.

  「Ah……」

  I realized it.

  This is a talk about genetics.

  In the scenario when a person of master origin makes a child with another person who is of master origin, the child will for sure be of master origin.

  Then what happens when a master origin makes a child with someone of a servant origin? In that case, the child will definitely be of servant origin. That rule is unchanged regardless of whether the person of master origin is male or female.  

  The situation is a bit special when a person of servant origin makes a child with another person of servant origin. In most cases, their child will possess no magic power; a person of slave origin will be born.

  But on rare occasions, a child of servant origin could be born as well. Different study materials say things differently, but the probability seems to be around 1 or 2 out of 30 births.

  If someone of servant origin makes a child with someone of slave origin, their child will definitely be of slave origin.

  People of slave origin have absolutely no magic power. It doesn’t matter which parent is the person of servant origin, the child will not have any magic power.

  By the way, it’s required for the masters of the knight families to be of servant origin.

  That’s because even people of the servant origin have battle capabilities on a different level compared to commoners of the slave origin. To rule a land, force is necessary after all. 

  For that reason, making descendants is an important thing for people in the knight families. To ensure their family survives, they have to give birth to descendants of servant origin no matter what.

  It’s not rare for the knights in our territory to bring their sons or daughters of servant origin together to throw large orgy parties. It seems that sometimes siblings of servant origin would have sexual relationships with each other too.

  The rumor of daughters of the knight families being experienced in bed probably has something to do with that.

  And this really shows how important those babies of servant origin that Lupetta picked up were.

  The reason why noblemen are encouraged to sleep with many women is also so that the number of people of servant origin could increase.

  「Um, young master. Perhaps you didn’t know about this…?」

  When I was still young, Odie had always skillfully dodged the question when I asked who her father is.

  Since I didn’t want her to hate me if I kept on asking her about it either, I didn’t force her and just sealed that question in the back of my mind and forgot about it.

  The head maid belongs to the slave origin, and her daughter Odie is of the servant origin. In other words, Odie’s father has to be of master origin.

  Looking back at the life she had until now, the answer was there all along. The head maid is probably my father’s concubine.

  That reminds me, my father has told me before that “Having Lovey-dovey sex with an older sister type of woman is the best!”. My father is about 40 years old right now and the head maid is around 50.

  If I subtract their age in my head, I think the head maid is the one who father lost his virginity with. Surprisingly, that might just be right.

  Normal nobles only fall in love with a small number of women.

  The head maid from what I know had given birth to 7 boys and 1 girl. Father sure was into her, or quite into fucking her.

  「I see……No, don’t say the rest」

  In other words, Odie is my half-sister who has a different mother.

  I became even more confused about if it would be okay for me to put my hands on her, but my crotch continues to send signals to my brain that’s telling me to violate her right away.

  Since I was silent, she quickly finished helping me change.

  「I shall go prepare breakfast. Could I ask you to wait for a bit longer?」

  「Yeah. No problem」

  After I replied to her, Odie left the bedroom with light steps.

  When it comes to women I have a long term relationship with like Odie, I don’t want to be hated by them.

  If I force myself on her, I feel like I will suffer tremendous emotional damage afterwards when my mind is cleared of lust.

  My penis that was waiting to make an appearance was trembling sadly in my pants.

  Once breakfast ended, we departed from the city of Evermill.

  Since knight families have to show their face to the lord’s clan, even if we weren’t lodging in the other cities we passed by, they have to at least treat us to a meal. 

  For that reason, getting through those areas took some time.  

  On the 4th night after we left Nyuneri, I was welcomed by another knight family.

  And surprisingly, I still have not had sex yet.

  This was definitely not intended by any means. This is because there are no girls I like in this knight family that we’re stopping by.

  When the knight families of Qualdense give birth to daughters with no magic power(of the slave origin), many of them are sent to the castle of Nyuneri to learn manners. Those girls become what’s called high-class servants, but the real purpose of why they are sent there is so that they can try to gain the favor of the men who are in their lord’s clan.

  Although they are of slave origin, the seeds from a person of master origin will definitely grant them children of the servant origin. That is something they would be happy about.

  The knight family we’re staying with tonight has already sent all their beauties to the castle of Nyuneri, so the girls remaining here are the ones who aren’t so great. 

  As I lay on the bed that was prepared for me, my lust was circulating inside my body looking for a place to go.

  According to our schedule, we will arrive in Nambonan city the day after tomorrow, so there is still quite some time.

  I can’t have too much expectation for the girls of the knight family’s place we’ll stay at tomorrow either.

  It feels like I’m at a holiday resort with a feeling similar to “there might be better restaurants if we go a little further” as the number of restaurants continues to decrease. 

  If I knew it was going to be like this, I should have slept with the girls in Evermill.

  They say there’s no use crying over spilled milk or something, but my dick was crying over not being able to spill its milk.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 93: Arrival
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I was gazing idly at the majestic current of the large river until my ship was ready.

  The City of Nambonan is right on the opposite shore.

  For lunch, I had the high-quality freshwater fish that were caught from this large river and specially prepared for me.

  Since the City of Nyuneri isn’t that far away from a large river either, there would usually be fish lined up on the dining table.

  But as I thought, freshly caught and grilled fish that are specially tailored to my taste have a deliciousness that can’t be matched. 

  And because freshwater fish can’t be eaten as sashimi after all, they were all cooked properly.

  It might not be a problem for this body of mine that is filled with magic power, but due to the impressions I have from my previous life, I had no desire to eat freshwater fish raw.

  Even when I asked the fishermen about it, it didn’t seem like they had a culture of eating fish raw.

  Tesh and Odie would have probably looked at me weird too so I didn’t ask for sashimi.

  Since I didn’t have the time to eat fish this leisurely when I came to Nambonan City for war, it’s fun being in vacation mode this time.

  There were many people gathered at the harbor, and there was even a simple marketplace set up.

  When I took a small glance around, I saw all kinds of different creatures being sold. There were giant fishes that were as big as eels and tunas, eerie aquatic organisms that looked similar to ammonites, etc.

  I am very curious about how you eat the ammonite looking thingies. I don’t think the City of Nyuneri has food like that.

  As I walked around, the people casually moved away and avoided me.

  It appears there are very few people who want to have anything to do with a noble who is surrounded by tough-looking guards.

  「Mm?」

  There was a crowd in a corner of the marketplace.

  When I looked in the direction of that group of people, I immediately understood what was happening there.

  I will try to quietly get closer without getting noticed.

  「Stand up, grape stomping girl! With the voices of spirits guiding you, tens of thousands of troops await you, to that place you go!」

  *Ooooh*, the surrounding audience cheered. It looks like the people didn’t really realize that I came near them.

   Here, a man was telling a story while making hand and body gestures as onlookers surrounded him.

   His narration was skilled; it was a story that smoothly entered my ears.

  Since the continent of Elluo doesn’t have a high literacy rate, stories told from other people’s mouths are one of the valuable forms of entertainment that people have. 

  Adventurers and merchants who travel everywhere would remember the stories they hear in various regions, and then they would summarize the really interesting bits and retell those stories in faraway territories to make a little bit of money.

  When the storyteller announced that the story was over, several coins flew out as his tips. The man counted those coins in satisfaction.

  As the gathered crowd started to disperse, I was able to get a better look at his appearance. It looks like he’s a merchant who deals with manuscripts.

  「Let me see that manuscript」

  「Yes sir, please go ahead……」

 

  When I approached him, the man got on his knees with a stiff expression on his face.

  「Hm. ……I’ll take this, this, and this too. How much?」

  Out of the manuscripts of famous scholars, I only chose the ones I don’t have yet.

  There are times I lack entertainment as well, so when there’s a chance like this, I’ll gladly stock up on some literature.

  After the man told me how much they cost while shaking, Tesh, who was on standby behind me, handed the money to him.

  When I added an extra silver coin as a tip, the man’s voice cracked as he bowed down and thanked me.

  「That was a pretty interesting story. Does that story have a name?」

  「Y-yes. It’s called “Olshian”」

  To just use the male protagonist’s name as the title…That’s not very creative…

  The City of Nambonan was originally surrounded by fortified walls, but after they surrendered, almost all of the walls ended up being removed.

  Their walls that were built with plenty of stones that repel magic(magic-servering stones) are now being reused as fortifications in the western part of our territory. 

  Because of that, the City of Nambonan had lost its walls and the city had become stark naked.

  Since there are only small “fields” near the city, even if a mature magic beast comes out, it shouldn’t do much damage. 

  However, living in such an exposed city would indeed make the citizens feel uneasy.

  We went past where the city gate was originally supposed to be and entered the city.

  It was like this in all the other cities we passed through on the way here too, but it seems that the City of Nambonan was no exception to knowing about my magic beast subjugation either, as I was welcomed with loud cheers. It looks like the information has spread really far.

  At any rate, due to the propaganda that paints me as a young noble who made a direct appeal to my father to protect Nambonan’s self-governance because I was moved by the citizen’s voices being spread everywhere behind the scenes, my popularity with the people here was high originally. So combined with my magic beast subjugation this time, my popularity has risen even further.

 The people are probably feeling reassured as well about the fact that a noble who had defeated the magic beast had come to their currently unwalled city.

  Even though the sun had already set, there were still some people who waited for me in front of the mayor’s residence to welcome my arrival with cheers.

  That made me feel quite pleasant.

  After I had a bath and a meal in the mayor’s residence, Rumon, the “boner popping older brother”, came to me while I was sipping on my tea.  

  There seems to be a complete set of detailed information about Nambonan city lying in the mayor’s office right now. He began talking about the important things on the spot.

  The rumor of Rumon being highly capable in office processing work seems to be true; his oral explanations were easy to understand, and he can easily summarize the compiled wooden boards with just one quick look.

  「Oh yeah, what happened to Kohali?」

  「My little sister is already resting in her room today. I apologize for that」

  「I see」

  It was already pretty late at night when I was taking a bath and eating.

  We have light here since Tesh, Odie and I were using illumination magic, but for normal citizens, they would already be asleep long ago.

  Rumon, who lives and works at the mayor’s residence, would probably normally be sleeping at this time too, as he looks somewhat tired.

  「Have you gotten a bit used to your current lifestyle?」

  「Yes. I’m very grateful to you for that, mayor」

  Like that, he began thanking me for the life he has now.

  When Rumon’s home and money were robbed from him because of the war, he said that he was going to become a peddler, but now that he has calmed down, he told me he realized just how reckless that was.

  「It was a naive idea」

  Generally, people live their entire life in the city they are born in. Going into cities you don’t know without knowing anyone in those places is a terrifying thing for commoners of this era. Moreover, he has Kohali who is ignorant of the real world with him.

  Sooner or later they would be in debt, and then this pair of siblings will probably either starve to death together or end up being sold.

  Right now, he can live a stable life like this as a city employee.

  「I’m happy that I can work for Nambonan’s sake」

  Rumon seems to be someone who loves his city instead of his country. He seems to feel joy from taking part in the city’s management.

  He’s not rich, but it looks like he has been spending his days happily with his beloved sister.

  「Uh huh……」

  I’m sorry for interrupting him while he’s talking about all kinds of things happily, but I want to ask if Kohali has gotten used to her current lifestyle.

  I’m not all that interested at all in whether or not he’s happy.

  「Is Kohali doing well?」

  「……Yes」

  It’s a shame, but it seems that she didn’t get pregnant.

  Since I only had sex with her once, it can’t be helped.

  「Whatever. The most important thing is that the beauty is doing well」

  「Mayor……!」

  「What?」

  Rumon seemed like he wanted to say something to me, but he stayed silent when I shot him a slight glare.

  Last time, I had fun with Kohali’s body in exchange for money and clothes.

  This time, they already have money and clothes, so there’s no reason to offer me her body. 

  However, even with such reasoning, the problem comes down to my desire to play with her in the end.

  He has gained a cool head after he started working here, so he knows that he cannot go against me since he fully understood my position.

  「Kohali is already asleep, right?」

  「Yes」

  「Okay. You can go rest too」

  As if he understood that I was not going to change my mind, Rumon left the room dejectedly.

  He probably couldn’t stand knowing that his precious little sister will be r*ped, but there’s no way he can go against my authority.

  After I finished another cup of tea, I called for Tesh.

  He seems to understand me even without me telling him where I’m going to let out 6 days of lust.

  「Should I bring her to your room, young master?」

  It’s not a bad idea to wake Kohali up and get her to come to my bedroom either.

  However, since I have an even better idea, I decided to ask him to just tell me where she is resting.

  The nuisance named Rumon might be getting hard in his own room as he thinks about Kohali’s naked body. 

  Let me enjoy her raw body in the meantime.

  My penis was sopping wet under the fabric of my pajamas.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 94: Savoring the Daughter of A Former Merchant Family In the Darkness (⅓)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In the depths of a forest where even the moonlight didn’t reach, the male foot soldier who was carrying an assault rifle moved forward as he crawled.

  Striped mosquitoes flew around his ears, land leeches were attached to his hands. The tension he felt from his covert operation and the harsh environment of the rainforest robbed the man’s stamina at a frightening speed.

  He was already in the enemy’s territory, and he had no idea when or where his enemies would show up. 

  Being discovered in this place would mean death.

  This forest that was dyed in darkness so dense to the point that it had the illusion that it would continue forever- it was as if the forest was hinting to the man that his end had come.

  “Yobai” (Night crawling).

  I remember when I first heard this term in Japan in my previous life, what surfaced in my mind was that type of scene that’s like it’s straight out of a war movie.

  I know the real meaning of that term now of course, but that first impression was strong so whenever I hear “Yobai”, I end up with the image of a ranger squad in my head. Although since the language spoken in the continent of Elluo is Elluonese, it’s not Japanese that I’m hearing. 

  I did not crawl down the hallway, but instead, I walked towards tonight’s planned location of operation in light steps.

  Kohali and Rumon live in this mayor’s residence where they work. Since the residence was originally the siblings’ home, they probably feel comfortable living in it. As a reference, it seems that their rent is deducted from their salary.

  I was told that they are borrowing the small rooms that were being used as storerooms within the residence.

  Since the fine adjustments in that area are arranged by our army’s civil officials, I don’t know where exactly the storerooms they were pushed into are located.

  Nonetheless, it appears that they did not borrow rooms that are as luxurious as Kohali’s old room. If they did that, their salaries might end up at zero from the rent deduction. 

  Tesh seems to have confirmed the room assignments when we arrived at the mayor’s residence. He guided me fluently as if he lived here.  

  「Here we are, young master」

  「Good work」

  I heard she was assigned to a small room, but at first glance, the room looked surprisingly normal. Even when I used how wide the door was as a comparison, I feel like it should be reasonably roomy inside.

  Since there is a small wooden plate hanging from the door, I will try to shine illumination magic on it like I’m using a flashlight.

  『Rumon & Kohali』was written on the plate.

  「It’s a shared room, huh?」

  「Yes. Rather than renting two small rooms, renting one slightly bigger room has less of a deduction on their pay」

  It’s a pitiful way of living in poverty.  

  Rumon was disheartened when he left just earlier, but I’m sure he’s sleeping in this room right now.

  I don’t think he has done any reprehensible acts, but if he’s sleeping with Kohali in the same bed right now, I will kick him out and have him sleep in the garden or in the hallways from now on.

  After I sent Tesh away, I opened the door without knocking.

  There wasn’t a lock on the door in the first place, so it opened quietly without any problems.

  It’s not easy to get lighting tools in the continent of Elluo like it was in Japan. To this pair of commoner siblings who are already living in poverty, I’m sure that they wouldn’t want to spend money on even candles or fuel.

  The room was dark enough to make my feet hesitate just as I was about to step inside. This pair of siblings are probably the only ones who can walk normally in this room that doesn’t have a shred of light.

  Going by how it’s completely silent in the room, I assume they were already sleeping.

  When I pointed my illumination magic in the room, I could see that their window had been framed by planks. It seems that they have thoroughly taken protective measures against the cold since we’re already at a time where the night breeze is cold. So that’s why not even the starlight gets through to the room.

  There is a small table and wardrobe, and then there are two beds next to each other at the corner of the room. 

  「Mayor……?!」

  I guess he wasn’t asleep yet; Rumon’s face went red and he sat up on his bed as soon as he saw me.

  I told him to either leave the room or sleep quietly.

  His face turned pale, but he immediately shut his mouth tight and stopped moving around. He’s a man who knows his place quite well.

  I went close to the bed that Kohali should be sleeping in and adjusted the brightness of my illumination magic to be similar to candle’s and pointed it there.

  Then what was illuminated there was Kohali who was sleeping happily. Her straight, silver-colored hair that did not have a single knot was beautiful. 

  After I made a hand gesture at Rumon telling him to go to bed already as he stared at me, I cut off my illumination magic.  

  The illumination magic wasn’t that bright in the first place, but the room was covered in complete darkness just from it disappearing.

  It was nothing but pitch black in my field of vision.

  「Zzzzzー……」

  As Kohali slept soundly in peace, I put my hand on her blanket.

  I gently flipped it open in a way that wouldn’t wake her up, then I snuck in it and lay down next to her.

  While I had difficulty understanding what’s where because it’s too dark, I adjusted my body’s position under the blanket.

  I gently rolled Kohali’s body from her sideways sleeping position to put her on her back, and then I hung over her like I was doing push-ups on top of her.

  My cock that is packed with 6 days of lust is already so hard that it feels like it could rip out of my pajamas. 

  「*Kiss*」

  It seems that I misjudged the distance due to the darkness and accidentally kissed her nose.

  I slid the tip of my tongue down from there and searched for the location of her lips.

  「*Kiss*……」

  「Mnn……」

  This time, I could tell that our lips touched. It looks like I was able to align it well.

  Is it because my vision is not reliable? I feel like the sensation of kiss was more delicate than usual.

  I continued to suck on Kohali’s lips while I made kissing noises.

  「*Suck*, *suckk*, *suck*…」

  「Nnmーm………*kiss*. ……Mnn……*kiss*…*kiss*…Nmm……」

  In a state where I completely covered her, I enjoyed her lips to the fullest.

  It really feels great to press my penis on her soft body as our lower bodies stuck to each other.

  And most importantly, this situation of me attacking her in her sleep was rapidly raising my sexual excitement.

  「Nn, nnn……? Brother……? Mm……?」

  When I let go of her lips after the deep kiss, Kohali woke up and spoke in a sleepy voice.

  「……Nn, brother……? Isn’t your bed…over there…?」

  I can’t see her expression at this mere 10-20cm of distance because of the darkness, but I could at least tell that she is bewildered.  

  It looks like Kohali has mistaken me, who had snuck into her bed, for her brother Rumon.

  This room is a room they share, so it’s natural for her to think that. 

  Rumon’s build and mine are quite different, but perhaps it’s because she’s not used to sleeping with men, it seems like Kohali couldn’t tell the difference. 

  I’m glad that she didn’t see through it like “This way of kissing is not my big brother’s”.

  「Mnn……?!」

  I stuffed her mouth again. Luckily, I didn’t hit her nose this time and was able to press my lips on hers.

  I slowly tasted her soft and warm lips and rubbed my tongue on the inside of her cheek.

  「MNnn……Nnn?! Nnn-! Mnmmm, mmm*suckk*! Mmnn?!」

  Kohali’s body stiffened as I licked her along her gums, then she started to push my face away with her hands.

  「*Puahh*, ahhh……B-brother, what are you……Mmguguu?!」

  Our lips overlapped again the moment she let her guard down.

  I pressed my body strongly on hers to pin her down and felt her softness with my entire body.

  I enjoyed that soft and feminine body as I grinded my hardened erect cock against her.

  「Nnnooo……Mnn! Brother……Mnnnnnnnuuuu! *Kiss*, nnn *kiss*…Sto-mmnn……」

  Kohali endured the kiss as her body trembled. The way she could only weakly resist with a fragile voice is really nice.

  「*Kiss*….Mnnn, Stop…please, brother…why are you……」

  When I released her lips, Kohali did not try to escape and just spoke in a voice that sounded like she was going to cry.

  “My older brother suddenly changed”. Terrified from such an illusion, Kohali’s small hands that were gripping onto my outerwear trembled.

  Normally when a girl does that, it would tickle my desire to protect her, but unfortunately, it’s not really that effective since there are no visuals at all because it’s too dark. I found out that this young lady’s “cutesy attacks” that make me want to spoil her are weak to the darkness attribute.

  「*Kiss*」

  「*Kiss*……Mm……」

  This time, I gave her some light pecks on her lips while I stroked her cheek.

  Compared to a deep kiss where it’s like there’s a snake coiling her tongue, she was resisting it less.

  I kept on doing it with fluent movements as I gently ran the palm of my hand all over her body to confirm the shape of her sleepwear.  

  I think she’s probably wearing the type of pajamas that commoners often wear that is similar to a japanese style apron. 

  When I tried touching her chest, I felt a faint heat coming from her nice pair of breasts.

  「Ah……Please stop……Brother」

  「*Kiss*」

  I kissed her forehead as if I was saying “I refuse”, then I snuck my hand into her pajamas and groped her breast raw. 

  It had a balance between a mochi-like elasticity and a softness that sucks my finger in. The feeling of a nearly matured girl really excites me.

  「Ah, ah……Brother, brother…Stoppp」

  「*Kiss*」

  「Nnmm……*Puah*……」

  As I rubbed her butt and grinded my body on hers, I loosened up her clothes little by little. 

  The occasional anxious sighs coming out of her and the way she’s calling me her big brother made my cock get even harder. 

  Since my cover hasn’t been blown yet, I decided to challenge how far I can keep going like this.

Chapter 94: Savoring the Daughter of A Former Merchant Family In the Darkness (⅓)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In the depths of a forest where even the moonlight didn’t reach, the male foot soldier who was carrying an assault rifle moved forward as he crawled.

  Striped mosquitoes flew around his ears, land leeches were attached to his hands. The tension he felt from his covert operation and the harsh environment of the rainforest robbed the man’s stamina at a frightening speed.

  He was already in the enemy’s territory, and he had no idea when or where his enemies would show up. 

  Being discovered in this place would mean death.

  This forest that was dyed in darkness so dense to the point that it had the illusion that it would continue forever- it was as if the forest was hinting to the man that his end had come.

  “Yobai” (Night crawling).

  I remember when I first heard this term in Japan in my previous life, what surfaced in my mind was that type of scene that’s like it’s straight out of a war movie.

  I know the real meaning of that term now of course, but that first impression was strong so whenever I hear “Yobai”, I end up with the image of a ranger squad in my head. Although since the language spoken in the continent of Elluo is Elluonese, it’s not Japanese that I’m hearing. 

  I did not crawl down the hallway, but instead, I walked towards tonight’s planned location of operation in light steps.

  Kohali and Rumon live in this mayor’s residence where they work. Since the residence was originally the siblings’ home, they probably feel comfortable living in it. As a reference, it seems that their rent is deducted from their salary.

  I was told that they are borrowing the small rooms that were being used as storerooms within the residence.

  Since the fine adjustments in that area are arranged by our army’s civil officials, I don’t know where exactly the storerooms they were pushed into are located.

  Nonetheless, it appears that they did not borrow rooms that are as luxurious as Kohali’s old room. If they did that, their salaries might end up at zero from the rent deduction. 

  Tesh seems to have confirmed the room assignments when we arrived at the mayor’s residence. He guided me fluently as if he lived here.  

  「Here we are, young master」

  「Good work」

  I heard she was assigned to a small room, but at first glance, the room looked surprisingly normal. Even when I used how wide the door was as a comparison, I feel like it should be reasonably roomy inside.

  Since there is a small wooden plate hanging from the door, I will try to shine illumination magic on it like I’m using a flashlight.

  『Rumon & Kohali』was written on the plate.

  「It’s a shared room, huh?」

  「Yes. Rather than renting two small rooms, renting one slightly bigger room has less of a deduction on their pay」

  It’s a pitiful way of living in poverty.  

  Rumon was disheartened when he left just earlier, but I’m sure he’s sleeping in this room right now.

  I don’t think he has done any reprehensible acts, but if he’s sleeping with Kohali in the same bed right now, I will kick him out and have him sleep in the garden or in the hallways from now on.

  After I sent Tesh away, I opened the door without knocking.

  There wasn’t a lock on the door in the first place, so it opened quietly without any problems.

  It’s not easy to get lighting tools in the continent of Elluo like it was in Japan. To this pair of commoner siblings who are already living in poverty, I’m sure that they wouldn’t want to spend money on even candles or fuel.

  The room was dark enough to make my feet hesitate just as I was about to step inside. This pair of siblings are probably the only ones who can walk normally in this room that doesn’t have a shred of light.

  Going by how it’s completely silent in the room, I assume they were already sleeping.

  When I pointed my illumination magic in the room, I could see that their window had been framed by planks. It seems that they have thoroughly taken protective measures against the cold since we’re already at a time where the night breeze is cold. So that’s why not even the starlight gets through to the room.

  There is a small table and wardrobe, and then there are two beds next to each other at the corner of the room. 

  「Mayor……?!」

  I guess he wasn’t asleep yet; Rumon’s face went red and he sat up on his bed as soon as he saw me.

  I told him to either leave the room or sleep quietly.

  His face turned pale, but he immediately shut his mouth tight and stopped moving around. He’s a man who knows his place quite well.

  I went close to the bed that Kohali should be sleeping in and adjusted the brightness of my illumination magic to be similar to candle’s and pointed it there.

  Then what was illuminated there was Kohali who was sleeping happily. Her straight, silver-colored hair that did not have a single knot was beautiful. 

  After I made a hand gesture at Rumon telling him to go to bed already as he stared at me, I cut off my illumination magic.  

  The illumination magic wasn’t that bright in the first place, but the room was covered in complete darkness just from it disappearing.

  It was nothing but pitch black in my field of vision.

  「Zzzzzー……」

  As Kohali slept soundly in peace, I put my hand on her blanket.

  I gently flipped it open in a way that wouldn’t wake her up, then I snuck in it and lay down next to her.

  While I had difficulty understanding what’s where because it’s too dark, I adjusted my body’s position under the blanket.

  I gently rolled Kohali’s body from her sideways sleeping position to put her on her back, and then I hung over her like I was doing push-ups on top of her.

  My cock that is packed with 6 days of lust is already so hard that it feels like it could rip out of my pajamas. 

  「*Kiss*」

  It seems that I misjudged the distance due to the darkness and accidentally kissed her nose.

  I slid the tip of my tongue down from there and searched for the location of her lips.

  「*Kiss*……」

  「Mnn……」

  This time, I could tell that our lips touched. It looks like I was able to align it well.

  Is it because my vision is not reliable? I feel like the sensation of kiss was more delicate than usual.

  I continued to suck on Kohali’s lips while I made kissing noises.

  「*Suck*, *suckk*, *suck*…」

  「Nnmーm………*kiss*. ……Mnn……*kiss*…*kiss*…Nmm……」

  As I rubbed her butt and grinded my body on hers, I loosened up her clothes little by little. 

  The occasional anxious sighs coming out of her and the way she’s calling me her big brother made my cock get even harder. 

  Since my cover hasn’t been blown yet, I decided to challenge how far I can keep going like this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 96: Savoring the Daughter of A Former Merchant Family In the Darkness (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  

  Kohali accepted my ejaculation with her hands wrapped around my back.

  It makes me feel like I did it with a female who embraced the sex, and the excitement that should have left my body together with my semen started to rise inside me. 

  「Aaa……Brother, this……Ah ♡」

  With my cock still connected to her, I rubbed her clitoris with my finger.

  The area around her vagina’s opening tightened nicely, urging me to become hard again. It was as if her vagina was asking for a cock. 

  「*Kiss*……*kisskiss*」

  「Nnaa……Mn, *kiss*……Brother……W-we can’t anymore…I-I’m going to have a baby……」

  That’s exactly what I want.

  I gently pressed my lips on hers and conveyed to her that her becoming pregnant is what I’m hoping for. 

  Then, I lightly pushed my cock that was already becoming hard towards the back of her vagina.

  

  「Brother……Nooo, noo…Mnnm」

  「*Slurp*……*Kisskiss*」

  As I kneaded my cock inside her pussy that was bathed in semen, the hardness of it got to a sufficient level.

  My balls still had a ton left from the 6 days of not having sex. I had planned to plant all those seeds in Kohali tonight.

 

  「*Pant*, mnn……brother, st-stop already ♡ Please……Mnaa ♡ Aaa……No ♡」

  By slowly thrusting my hardened cock, I pushed the semen that I released in her vagina deeper and deeper.

  The room that is shrouded in darkness seems to be getting colored by our hot moans. 

  「Brother…..? What are you……??」

  I pulled my cock out, then I focused on putting my hands around Kohali’s back.

  Seemingly not understanding what I want to do, Kohali entrusted her body to me while remaining puzzled.

  I flipped her and made her lie face down.

  This isn’t anything important but there was an adult term called “flipping” in Japan from my previous life.

  It meant to ask for the same prostitute you asked for before on your last visit to a brothel, but I did not know that meaning when I first heard that term. 

  When I heard someone say “I flipped that girl”, I imagined something like “I flipped that girl over so I don’t see her face because she’s so ugly”.

  This isn’t me calling on her again like she’s a prostitute, I flipped her around to have another go with her.

  I stroked Kohali’s body and confirmed her position in the darkness.

  「*Pant*……Nnnn……*pant*……♡」

  Since I can’t see in the dark, I ended up being super conscious of her existence from just running my hands on her.

  It seems that the same goes for her; she appears to be feeling especially sensitive about the fact that there’s someone touching her body from beyond the darkness. 

  She twitched from just being touched by my hands and leaked out a seductive voice that made me want to attack her just from hearing it.

  I played around by repeatedly poking my index finger at the gap between her buttcheeks, and then I traced the line of her spine with my tongue. Her moist, sweaty skin tasted just a little bit salty.

  「Ahhhnn…..Noo……Brotherr…..Mn ♡ S-stop, stop already……Uaaa…」

  「*Kiss*」

  I placed my hands on Kohali’s hips, and then I lifted them up in one go. I put her in a cat’s stretching pose with her butt sticking up.  

  This time, I will have sex with this young lady like we’re two animals mating.

  「Ehhh……Noo, brother?! Ah, a position like this, it’s embarrassing, noo♡ Ahh ♡ Mnn ♡ AhHhhhhhh ♡ mnn ♡ Aahhh, brother ♡ Nooo!」 

  I thoroughly rubbed her butt that’s sticking out, and then when I used the semen that dripped out as lube on her private area, Kohali immediately stopped resisting.  

  I opened her butt wide like I was stretching out her butthole and identified the insertion spot.

  Kohali is making a fuss saying things like “it’s embarrassing, it’s embarrassing”, but I just spread her legs open without worrying about that.

  Unfortunately, since having anal sex can’t give birth to a new life, I made sure it’s the right hole with my fingers before I pushed my cock in.

  Thanks to the semen I shot out earlier, it started to go in smoothly.

  「Ahh……Ah……Aaa ♡」

  I felt that Kohali was trying to crawl away with her upper body, so I grabbed onto her hips firmly to not let her escape.

  We’re in a position where her face is lying on the bed, and I’m behind her with only her butt sticking up.

  I could really feel my cock penetrating her vagina even deeper than before.

  「Brother……Ukk……it’s deep…Ah ♡ D-don’t mov…ve…♡」

  I don’t know if she’s moving her butt slowly to escape from the feeling of tightness or pain after I went so deep, but my cock was stimulated by those movements and I became even harder.

  「Ahh……AAhh……it’s so hard…Uu ♡  *Haaaa* ♡ Uuu~ ……」

  As I moved my hips gently in a circular motion, I waited for Kohali to start to get used to this position.

  I pressed one hand onto her clitoris and lightly stimulated it while I used my other hand to intensely massage the area around her anus.

  「AAaaaannuuuu ♡ AH, Aaaaah ♡ B-brother…」

  I put more force into my hand movements in response to her voice.

  Then, she tightened up on my cock that was penetrating her.

  「Ah ♡ Brother……♡ Ahh~ ♡ Uuuuuuuu ♡ Ah, *haa*, *haa*……Noo ♡」

  Kohali’s pussy began to pulsate to ask me for more semen. 

  Her pussy that had started to learn how to ask for semen enveloped my cock passionately, and it repeated to contract like it was begging me.

  「Uaah ♡」

  After I confirmed that everything’s ready, I firmly secured the area around the border of her hips and glutes.

  Maybe it’s because she understood that that was the preparation for intense thrusting, she shook her butt like she did not want it. 

  「Stopp……Brother, noo ♡ don’t……I’m going…I’m going to get pregnant…」

  If so, that would be a happy ending.

  I slowly pulled my cock back and then thrusted all the way to her deepest area in one go.

「Ahhhhhh ♡ Ahhhh ♡ Nmnn♡ *Haahhh* ♡ Brotherr, AAaa!」

  I am pulling back and thrusting with all I have.

  The intense thrusting is probably causing the semen that I shot in her earlier to scatter everywhere, as I felt lukewarm semen hitting my thighs.

  「NOo ♡ Haahaa, Annn ♡ Aaahn ♡ Brotherr ♡ Ahh ♡ Brother, noo ♡ Auunn ♡」

  The wooden bed squeaked like it was wailing from our intense mating.

  That stimulated the bestial desire within me yet again and made me move my hips faster. Kohali was enduring my movements while moans were leaking out of her mouth.

  「Ah ♡ AA ♡ Aa ♡ Brother, brother, AAaAaaa ♡ No, brother, I’m scared……Ah ♡ Brother ♡ Brother ♡ *pant* ♡ AAa♡」

  Her entire body began to shake like she was afraid of the climax that was creeping up.

  I extended my arms out to her shoulders, then I pulled her arms back and held onto her hands.

  「Ahh ♡ Brother……*haa*, *pant* ♡ Br-brother, hug…hug me tight……♡」

  To meet her demand, I pushed my body on her back and gave her a deep hug.

  While I casually took a breather after becoming tired from the thrusting, I hugged her to make our connection deeper.

  「AAaaaaaaa ♡ Brotherrrrrr ♡ AAAh~♡ *haa*, *haa*, uu, brother……Aahhf ♡ haauff……Aaaa……Brother, brother……brotherr……♡ 

  Kohali held my hands strongly.

  Her grip was strong, then weak, then strong again. It was as if she was making sure that I was there in the darkness.

  「Bro…brother….Nn ♡ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaa ♡」

  With a loud moan, Kohali held my hands with the most strength she had used up to this point.  

  To help her climax, I hugged her body closely and leaned on her butt to penetrate her deeply.

  「Aauuuuuu~♡」

  A vulgar moan of an animal that drowned in pleasure. 

  That caused my cock to really empathize with her, and my semen surged up instantly.

  「Ugh! …! 」

  *Spurrt!* *Spurt!* *Spurrtt!*  I made an effort to hit the back of her vagina. Shooting into a butt that’s sticking out is exactly what fucking is about.

  「…! 」

  Semen overflowed from my trembling cock, and then it started to pour into her vagina.

  It was the very thing of animal behavior.

  「*Pant*……*Pant*……*Haa*……」

  「*Pant*……Aa……So much came out……B-brother’s…baby…Uaaah……」

  As a brain-melting feeling of pleasure invaded my brain, I continued to let out every single drop of semen inside her. 

  Kohali’s pussy accepted my seeds while it shivered, and it squeezed my withered cock as it sucked out even the semen in my urethra.

  Her body that is eagerly trying to make a baby is so irresistibly adorable. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 97: I Savored the Daughter of A Former Merchant Family In the Darkness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The fact that I was able to go 5 rounds like never before is probably a blessing from abstaining from sex.

  Usually, I’ll just do it if I have a chance to sleep with someone, but I think it’s nice to hold back once in a while before freeing myself too.

  「*Haa*……*haa*, Br…brother……No…no more」

  「*Kiss」

  「Nnmm……*kiss*」

  The bed had a nasty dampness all over it due to our semen and love juices and whatnot.

  The distinct scent that was born from a man and a woman’s copulation is mixed in with the darkness of the room.

  Kohali who is breathing heavily in my arms seems to be near her physical limits already.

  Unlike me who is trained from constantly having sex in the last several months, Kohali was a sheltered virgin until recently. It’s understandable that she would be like this.

  Even though she was just being passive, she seems so exhausted.

  「*Kiss*. *Kisskiss*」

  「Leeh……*kiss*……*kiss*」

  Despite Kohali not even resisting my kisses at all now, she did not ever initiate a kiss either.

  Even when I stroked the back of her head to urge her to kiss me after I let go of her lips, Kohali did not move regardless of whether she knew what I was getting at or not.

  Well, if she would kiss me so easily here, she would probably start tempting Rumon one of these days to be her partner, so it’s a good thing that she wouldn’t.

  「Nnn……*pant*…*haa*…*pantt*…」

  As I thought, I feel like a 6th round would be difficult. I have no idea if my semen would still come out, and more importantly, Kohali looks like she’s having a hard time.

  Perhaps she understood from the way I’m caressing her that our play tonight has already ended; Kohali put her face on my chest and recovered her breathing.

  「Brother……What should we do…from here on…? Brother……」

  Kohali went through round 2, 3, 4, and then held a climax festival, but once she calmed down, what remained seemed to be only her worries.

  I heard that in small villages away from the cities, incest does sometimes happen in order for those villages to maintain their population, but it doesn’t really happen in the city of Nambonan.

  Still, the fact that Kohali is relying on Rumon even though she thinks she was r*ped by him really makes me feel that she’s a sheltered girl who knows nothing about the world.

  「……B-brother……?」

  The fact that her brother whom she relies on isn’t answering her seems to have made Kohali more uneasy than I imagined.

  Kohali, who is resting her face on my chest, began to tremble slightly.

  「……Uu……Uu……」

  Gracefully, as if she’s holding her tears back, as if she wants me to fawn on her, Kohali who began crying was very adorable.

  As someone who lived a life as a naive sheltered girl, it feels like her body is enchanted with a spell that can incite a man’s protective instincts.

  I was enveloped with a sense of pleasure after my male ego was stroked perfectly, and at the same time, my desire to monopolize her gushed out. A desire to put Kohali under my protection so that I can protect her with my own hands was born.

  In a sense, a maiden’s fragileness might be effective as an all-in strategy against me.

  In order to make Kohali mine, I opened my mouth,

  「Kohali」

  The moment I spoke out, her body stiffened.

  Then, I spoke to her once more to inform her that she didn’t hear wrong.

  「Kohali. I’m not your brother」

  「……AHhhh……AHHH……N…NOO!」

  I forcefully hugged Kohali as she tried to escape from my arms.

  She rejected me with a force that is incomparable to the resistance she has put up to this point.

  It can’t be helped since her partner who she thought was her brother turned out to be a mysterious rapist.

  I activated illumination magic and created a dim glow. It was just a weak glow that would show our faces.

  「……Can you see my face? Kohali」

  While Kohali was in the middle of trying to wriggle out to escape like a cat that’s being hugged, I tried to make her look at me.

  She was set on resisting at first, but after a second, she took a closer look at my face and gasped in shock as if she came to a realization.

  「You’re…the mayor…?」

  「That’s right. I’m surprised you still remember me. I’ll give you a reward for that」

  I faced Kohali who was pushing me away with her stiffened thin arms and reached in for a kiss.

  「Nnmn…*Kiss*」

  「*Kisskiss*. ……We’ve kissed many times already, so there’s no need to resist like that, right?」

  With that said, when I touched her arms that were extending out with my hand, Kohali put them down like she gave up.

  Next, I brought her body closer and gave her a tongue entwining kiss.

  I ran my tongue on hers that still had the residual heat from our sex as if I was declaring her as mine.  

  「Nnm……♡ *Kiss* ♡」

  「*Puahh*. Good girl, Kohali」

  We’ve kissed more than I can keep count from just tonight alone, and Kohali was getting quite used to my kisses.

  That is in both the technical sense as well as the psychological sense.

  She might be just moving unconsciously, but when I extend my tongue out, she would catch it with hers. It feels like I’m training an innocent girl to my liking and it feels fulfilling.

  「Mayor……So you got here already」

  Kohali said as she wiped her lips with her bare hands.

  It looks like she had received the news that I would be arriving at Nambonan tonight. Well, it would be weird for her to not know about it since she takes care of the chores of the mayor’s residence.

  「Yeah. I came to see you. I came to see my Kohali」

  This time, sleeping with Kohali is also one of my objectives in Nambonan city. It’s a super-secret that’s only recorded on the memo inside my brain though.

  「Eh?」

  As if those words were unexpected to her, Kohali looked at me with a surprised expression.

  Last time, I only slept with her once when I was in Nambonan. That’s because I was busy with the post-war work and sleeping with Anna.

  From her point of view, since I did not attack her after that one time, she probably thought that I had lost interest in her. 

  「You already belong to me. You got that?」

  For some reason, when I see this kind of girl who came from a rich family, I can’t help wanting to approach her like a rough delinquent. That’s because I like situations where rich ladies who know nothing about the world are approached forcefully and exploited.

  I pulled Kohali towards me and hugged her strongly while she did not know how to react.

  「……Yes」

  Kohali really froze up when I hugged her, but she loosened up before long and leaned on my body.

  A slight doubt came to mind as I saw how unexpectedly obedient she was.

  「That’s commendable of you, but did something change your mind?」

  「No, you can say that I’ve always been like this…」

  After she said that, Kohali continued to speak little by little.

  Kohali and Rumon’s father is an extremely capable and extremely cool-headed man. His ability to become a big merchant of Nambonan city in a single generation was outstanding, but at the same time, he handled his relationship with his family half-heartedly.

  Rumon doted on his younger sister who had been completely neglected by her father, and Kohali grew up relying on her gentle brother as well.

  Setting Rumon who is useful at work aside, their father did not seem to hold any love towards Kohali who was living her carefree life. He did not seem to have any hesitation about using her as a chess piece for political marriages either.

  「So you were engaged, huh…」

  She said that the person she was engaged to was a merchant who was more than 30 years of age apart from her.

  Somehow, the image of the person I got from her was an image of a fat and grease-filled old man. When I imagine someone like that forcefully planting his seeds in Kohali against her will, my cock became just a little hard. When I get old someday, I want to try to buy myself a young woman.

  「Yes. But then I lost my home, and my engagement was gone as well…」

  Kohali was scheduled to marry when she became an adult at 16, but it seems that Rumon who was not happy about who she was marrying was successful in extending that date thanks to his work behind the scenes.

  Then what happened next was the Nambonan war.

  Their family’s wealth was absorbed by the Qualdense army, and Kohali’s purity was robbed by me. To Rumon, it was one misfortune after another.

  「But brother told me. It’s thanks to you that we could live like we do now, mayor」

  Rumon was visibly shaking in anger after I violated Kohali, but I also felt that he had calmed down after he started working here.

  He did say after dinner that if he wasn’t hired at the mayor’s residence, they could have starved to death on the streets by now. And in the end, Kohali’s forced engagement was also canceled.

  Moreover, perhaps she might be able to give birth to a child who possesses magic power too. From a commoner’s point of view, children who possess magic power are truly rare and valuable.

  In Rumon’s head, there are many “minus” factors to me, but there are many “pluses” as well. He might feel that if he adds them all up together, the total would be closer to a plus.

  I can kind of feel his father’s cool-headedness in him from the way he’s able to deal with the situation calmly without losing himself in the anger. It’s nice and logical.

  「Ah……! W-where’s brother…?」

  When we talked about Rumon, it probably reminded her that her brother should be next to her. Kohali’s body trembled and she tried to separate herself from me.

  「Don’t worry. I had Rumon leave the room to do something」

  「O-oh, is that so…」

  It’s a harmless lie.

  Our precious pillow talk would be ruined if I make her wary now.

  「Kohali, don’t talk about other men when you’re in bed with me」

  I looked into her eyes after I gave her a small kiss. With the illumination magic’s light, Kohali’s ruby-like eyes were sparkling.

  「Mayor……」

  「I will protect you. Me, the Mayor of Nambonan」

  I whispered into her ear as I embraced her strongly to my liking. In order to snatch her from her brother’s wing, I purposely appealed to her with my authority.

  Since she’s also a citizen of Nambonan, she probably has a pretty decent understanding of how much authority I hold.

  「Live as my woman and give birth to my children. Okay?」

  When I put my hand on her butt, Kohali’s face went red as if she thought of how she received my ejaculation in her vagina.

  We already have a much stronger connection with our lower body than something like an engagement. She already has no room left to choose.

  She did not reply to me, but she did not refuse my kisses.

  I continued to hug Kohali on this bed that’s smeared in our body fluids and closed my eyes.

  A short while after I cut off the illumination magic, I sensed that the door was opened.

  It seemed like Rumon had read the mood and left the room.

  「He was still awake huh…」

  Even though I was having sex with Kohali for a long period of time…I wonder if he was awake the whole time.

  I decided that I’ll give Rumon a little bit of pocket money once the sun comes up so he can go to a brothel.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 98: The Mayor’s Office
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When you live on the continent of Elluo where there’s nothing that resembles clocks, the accuracy of your body’s internal clock improves.

  I was certain that it was morning when I woke up, but to my surprise, it was still pitch black all around me. I thought about it for a second, then I remembered that the window was covered by planks. That’s why the morning light can’t come in. 

  When I lit the room up with illumination magic, Kohali, who was sleeping with a blanket wrapped around her, came into view.

  I got off the bed quietly so that I wouldn’t wake her up.

  When I came out of Rumon & Kohali’s room, Odie immediately rushed up to me. It looks like she has been waiting for me to get up while working nearby.

  In her expression that had been solidified for business use, I could faintly see some emotion in there. It was something gentle and warm, as if she’s a parent who was delighted at her child’s growth.

  The reason why Odie was waiting for me is to guide me to the bath. She had already prepared the morning bath under Tesh’s command.

  As I felt a sense of discomfort from my sticky body, I headed towards the open-air bath that’s in the courtyard with Odie leading the way.

  High-class servants basically don’t do any water-related housework or heavy lifting. That’s because those things are the low-class servants’ jobs. However, that’s with the exceptions of when there are no low-class servants present or if the high-class servant themself wants to do them.

  This time, it’s the former. Since there are no low-class servants in the mayor’s residence of Nambonan, Odie has no choice but to do that kind of work.  

  And so, I depended on Odie and had my penis carefully washed all the way inside the skin.

  Since my balls seem to be still empty from playing all night, my thing was withered to the point that it’s perfectly suitable to call it a child’s penis.

  Odie was in charge of helping me bathe when I was young. It’s just a tiny bit embarrassing that I ended up showing her a child’s penis that was no different from those days. I wanted to show her a towering erect cock that curves in a moon-shape, with the foreskin pulled back and veins popping out.

  I had breakfast after my bath, then after I went into the mayor’s office, today’s schedule surfaced in my mind while I sipped on some tea. 

  It was at this exact timing when Rumon came into the room. It was as though he had aimed for it.

  「Good morning, Mayor」

  Right as I wondered if he’s here to talk about work-related stuff, he said to me things like “thank you for looking after my sister” and lowered his head to me.

  Speaking of which, Kohali’s entire body seems to be sore because her muscles that she normally doesn’t use were overworked when we had sex. Tesh had informed me that Odie was assisting Kohali in the bath.

  「Can I please ask you for a favor?」

  「What is it?」

  「I don’t mind if it’s just a little bit, but could you continue to give Kohali some work to do?」

  According to Rumon, Kohali has become very cheerful and active lately.

  Up until now, she was just a rich girl of a merchant family who was enshrined like a doll since her father did not have any expectations for her. Although she’s only doing chores and miscellaneous work here, she was able to come in touch with the outside world and become useful to somebody. To Kohali, while it’s scary, it’s also a fresh experience that deeply satisfies her curiosity.

  Rumon seemed to fear that since Kohali learned about the outside world now, it will certainly be painful for her to return to that doll-type lifestyle.

  Well, she won’t be a mere doll this time though, she’ll be more like a love doll.

  「But even if she continues to do chores and odd jobs, there’s no way things will be the same as before. Kohali isn’t going to be treated the same as the other chore workers. If people see that she’s the only one who is receiving special treatment, don’t you think she’s going to induce their jealousy?」

  Once she’s my woman, there’s no way she’s going to be treated the same as the normal chore workers.

  Even right now, Kohali is having her body washed by the high-class servant, Odie. It’s because of the fact that she slept with me that she’s being treated graciously.

  If I were to give a comparison, high-class servants are people in managerial positions, low-class servants are normal employees, and chore workers are interns. Normally, someone of Kohali’s status would be the person who’s helping the people above her bathe. 

  Things like this will also probably keep on happening from now on. That’s because from my servants’ point of view, Kohali isn’t just a chore worker, she’s acknowledged as my woman.

  Many of her coworkers probably wouldn’t have good thoughts about her when there’s a difference in treatment even though they are all chore workers.

  They probably won’t do anything to her because of my authority, but the fire that’s raging in their hearts would still be there.

  I think Kohali wouldn’t have fun working in such an uneasy atmosphere either.

  「Mr.mayor seems to know well about how the masses think…… I think I want to discuss this over with Kohali」  

  「Just do what you want regarding that. Oh, and if there are any signs of her being pregnant, report to me right away」 

  Rumon received my words about pregnancy with a complicated expression on his face, but after I told him that I will arrange a healer to Kohali, his expression brightened up.

  「You will assign a healer to her?!」

  「I can hear you without you yelling. Kohali is my woman, right? I can’t have her dying」

  If you are a commoner, it’s hard to get a healer for pregnancy purposes even if you are rich. 

  It costs an extreme amount of money to get a healer for a pregnant woman when you don’t know when she’ll go into labor. In the first place, many healers who work for commoners have a noble ideology to help the people who are suffering from sickness or injuries. It would be pointless to flaunt your money at such people.

  Of course, since there are a good number of healers who are greedy for money as well, rich commoners will pile up a mountain of gold coins and hire that bunch.

  The #1 choice in such healers’ popularity ranking of career choices is to work exclusively with nobles.

  Their salary would be lower compared to being hired by rich commoners, but the stable position they would get from being acknowledged by the noble who runs the land would not be something that can be bought with money.

  Unfair tax arrests and unjust arrests that are made by authority figures based on nothing are not uncommon on the continent of Elluo. The easiest and most reliable way to counter those things would be to curry favor from the noble’s side.

  The House of Qualdense is a major noble family, so of course, many healers are employed by us. Among them, there are several healers who I can use as I like, so it won’t be a problem for me to station one of them in the city of Nambonan. Depending on the situation, I could even borrow a military healer for a short amount of time. 

  I would be mixing private affairs with official affairs pretty hard, but different from my past life in Japan, people are not going to nag me about that.

  It seems Rumon got the message that I’m serious about assigning a healer to Kohali. He let out a sigh of relief, and then he immediately looked like he was contemplating some things. 

  「……Could I let other people know that Kohali is the mayor’s woman?」

  I wonder if he wants to go around bragging about how his cute little sister became a noble’s mistress.

  「And the reason for that is?」

  「About that……」

  With that, Rumon began explaining the circumstances surrounding Kohali.

  The previously mentioned merchant who is more than 30 years older than Kohali whom she was engaged in a political marriage with seems to be obsessed with her still.

  Rumon told me that when that man found out that he and Kohali were financially ruined, he approached them and asked Kohali to move in as his concubine. At times, that man would like hire thugs to repeatedly threaten them. 

  Kohali is definitely a beauty so it’s not like I can’t understand why he wants her.

  Rumon told me he did all kinds of things to protect her, but he wants to use this chance to completely draw a line between them.

  「So that’s why you want to use my name, huh?」

  「Yes. After all, no one would act like they are opposing the mayor」

  To oppose me is to oppose the House of Qualdense. That’s the fastest route to the guillotine that’s in the city of Nambonan.

  If it’s the sly merchant who Kohali’s wealthy merchant father wanted her to have a political marriage with, he will surely understand the recklessness of that action.

  Since an idea suddenly hit me, I gave Rumon some instructions and silver coins and permitted him to leave.

  「Please, please take good care of Kohali」

  Before he left the room, Rumon bowed his head down deeply with his hands on the floor.

  When he first came into the room, he sounded desperate, but now there was true relief in his voice.

  I’m sure that he became relieved after he confirmed that I wasn’t just playing around with her, but actually going to take her in as my mistress.

  Since Rumon left, I grabbed one of the documents that were prepared for me.

  I was ready to see how much work has accumulated for me, but to my surprise, there wasn’t that much.

  It seems that Rumon had already examined the work carefully, so I just have to mostly double check and approve them.

  「He’s good enough to the point I want him to be a civil officer in the army」

  「I see」

  I tried asking one of our army’s civil officers who came to verify the documents about Rumon, and it seems that he has a really good reputation.

  The officer told me that he wanted to recruit Rumon to the army, but since Rumon really loves Nambonan, it would probably be the most efficient if I let him continue to work as a city official in this city. 

  Even though I thought I was going to be spending all day in the mayor’s office today, most of the work that can be done at the desk had been cleaned up by the afternoon. 

  I did give Rumon a few silver coins for his brothel costs, but I feel like I could have given him a bonus for his work too.

  After I thought that this was the perfect timing, I called Tesh to get some letters for me. They are the letters that came from the slave merchant Doran which talked about Eve’s mother.

  Just in case, I’ve gone over the entirety of the couple letters that we’ve exchanged about Eve’s mother again.

  According to the letters, Doran was scheduled to visit the city of Nambonan a bit earlier than me. There seems to be a slave company he’s on good terms with in Nambonan, so he can take the opportunity to deliver Eve’s mother to me as he restocks on slaves here. 

  Since the letters said that it’s okay to call him once I arrive, I decided to do that right away.

 

  「Call for this person」

  I showed the letter to Tesh and gave him the order.

  「As you wish」

  Tesh probably had somewhat imagined what I wanted to do when I told him to get those letters for me since he made an errand boy wait outside the mayor’s office.

  When he told this young chore worker “go”, the young man did not even ask Tesh anything in return and just walked down the hallway after he bowed.

  Since I had nothing left to do, I took the letter that recorded how Eve’s mother looked and read it again slowly. 

  The description wasn’t that detailed; it just plainly talked about her hair color, eye color, body type, and so on. Dolan’s confidence could be felt from these brief descriptions.

  It feels like he’s whispering to me saying that she’s a product so wonderful that it cannot be conveyed through a letter.

  When I realized that my throat was dry for some reason, I told Tesh to get me more tea and left the mayor’s office.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 99: Before the Election
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Eve’s mother is called Lavay.

  She was brought here by the slave merchant, Doran, and she is absolutely stunning. She is so beautiful that I think even females would be captivated by her.

  I was worried about how badly her body was injured since she was gang-raped by the kingdom’s expedition army, but the Gandoran Group probably has their own connections to healers since from what I can see, it doesn’t look like any injuries remained.

  I could feel her youthfulness from her white skin as I took a peek into her robe-like clothing. If I didn’t know beforehand, I would have probably mistaken her for Eve’s sister.

  What really made me feel that she’s Eve’s mother is her frighteningly well-proportioned face and her green eyes that are reminiscent of the deep woods.

  When I looked at her hair, the color wasn’t as dark as Eve’s dark honey color or as dark as amber; it was a light blonde that seems to have fused with the sunlight. Eve’s hair color might be from her father’s side. 

  Considering the remarkable growth of Eve’s breasts, I thought her mother would have explosive udders that are on Cynthia’s level, but to my surprise, their size is within the boundaries of common sense. Well, it’s weird to compare people to Cynthia’s size. Lavay’s breasts can already be called big. 

  Those appearance descriptions were all listed in the letters, but a picture is worth a thousand words. I know very well that I wouldn’t have understood what’s so good about her at all if I didn’t actually see her in person.

  When I thought to myself about how she’s going to become mine soon, I got excited and a smile naturally formed on my face.

  In response to me who was gazing at her fondly, Lavay faced me with a smile.

  Different from Eve, Lavay has been educated as a slave by the Gandoran Group. There is a large difference in her attitude towards customers compared to Eve.

  When I look at her smile that gives off a somewhat forced impression and the dark cuffs that bound her hands and legs, I can’t help but become conscious of the misfortune that had befallen her. 

  To Lavay, this isn’t the first time she got brought in front of customers to be sold as a slave. She had been brought to all kinds of places.

  In all of those places she had been brought to so far, there would be nothing but men who would make a woman feel disgusted waiting for her. The men would all try to buy her somehow, but then they would pass on making an individual purchase due to her high price. Then, she would be told things like “I’m going to discuss it with my fellow perverts to make a joint purchase so just wait for me a little longer”.

  Of course, it’s no coincidence that things turned out that way every time.

  All of those encounters were staged.

  They were acts that I had Doran stage for me, but Lavay will never know about that truth.

  In Doran’s letters, he said that he had hired some evil-looking employees and slaves of the Grandoran Group as the actors. He seems to have used his and the borrowed homes of his acquaintances to perform the acts. Since they used some other tricks aside from that to trick her as well, it took a considerable amount of effort and time.

  I’m not the one to talk since I was the one who made the request, but quite a lot of labor was spent on that. Although the sale of an elven sex slave is expected to generate a large amount of money for him, I really like his attitude to do anything to satisfy a customer. I want to be a customer of his company from here on too. 

  Anyway, Lavay was shown that she could have been bought by groups of ugly men over and over. Since she had nothing but bad things happen to her with the kingdom’s expedition army, being bought by a group would undoubtedly be a nightmare of a future from her point of view.

  I had Doran let her know that I have enough money to purchase her by myself instead of a joint purchase. She probably wants me to buy her at all costs right now.

  As I looked at Lavay who is trying to keep up a natural smile, I felt an indescribable feeling of excitement.

  After Lavay and the Gandoran Group’s employees withdrew from the place, I signed a contract with Doran who remained.

  I handed the mountain of gold coins that I had prepared beforehand to him and we adjusted the date of delivery. There’s no problem with same-day delivery either, but we’re not doing that because the farce is still going on.

  This purchase agreement is planned to be kept a secret to Lavay as she’ll be told “You didn’t get sold this time either”. Then, she will be told another lie where she’ll be getting purchased as a cum dumpster for the army.

  I will then show up gallantly to save her at a later date. That is what we planned as the final scene.

  I wonder if she’ll be so thankful to me that she’ll start sucking my penis on the spot.

  「Well then, please leave the rest of the work to me」

  「I’ll be counting on you then」

  After I grinned smugly, Doran thanked me respectfully and left.

 

  Since I had nothing left to do, I decided to inspect the city.

  I felt it last night when I entered the city as well, but a lot of citizens were working in high spirits. An enthusiasm that’s hot enough to make people forget that winter is coming seems to have enveloped the entire City of Nambonan.

  「It sure is lively here」

  「Yes. It’s because the election is coming up」

  The one who said that was Rumon. When I told him that I wanted to take a look around the city, he came along to explain things to me.

  A civil officer of the Qualdense army also came along, but since Rumon is the person who is the most informed about the city’s situation, the officer is only opening his mouth when there’s anything to add.

  I personally wanted to inspect the city with Kohali as my cute guide, but Rumon told me that would be impossible and I agreed with him. A sheltered rich girl like her probably wouldn’t be able to guide me around the city.

  「So the atmosphere’s like this because of the election?」

  「Yes. But this time is even more lively than usual. All of the citizens have been looking forward to it」

  The previous councilors were all driven out due to Nambonan’s defeat. The city’s council is practically in a collapsed state. From when we put Nambonan under control to this day, the Qualdense army has been temporarily ruling the administration.

  Although I declared that I want the citizens to regain self-governance in my speech, there is no guarantee that their independence will really return. The citizens seem to be uneasy the entire time because of that.

  「Since we made the date of the scheduled election public, the city has been like this the whole time」

  The citizens looked extremely glad that they regained the opportunity to deliver their will to the city administration. Rumon is also giving off a kind of genuinely happy vibe.

  Quotes like “The practice of local self-government is the best school of democracy” existed on Earth in my past life, but what’s important in a democracy is probably this exact kind of mindset that the citizens of Nambonan have.

  「Mayor, the names of this district’s candidates are listed on the board there」

  「Ohh?」

  To be chosen as a candidate for Nambonan’s election, you have to be a citizen who is respected and trusted by many people. Being adored by the citizens means that the election depends heavily on popularity votes.

  On the large wooden signboard that’s located at an eye-catching spot of the street, things like the candidates’ names and what kind of person they are were roughly written on there.

  When I stopped and took a glance at it, I found a name on there that I am familiar with.  

  「Hm. Anna’s name is on here」

  For some reason, Anna, the waitress who works at the tavern is among the names of candidates.  

  A name like Anna is common enough to be found everywhere, but since it has the tavern’s name attached next to where it says she’s working as a waitress, there should be no mistake that it’s the Anna I know.

  「Why is she a candidate?」

  「Miss Anna?」

  According to Rumon, Anna seems to have gotten nominated.

  Not only is she a famous poster girl at the tavern from the start, the fake intel of her preaching to me to protect the independence of Nambonan is circulating on the streets as well.

  It seems that partly because of those reasons, she has gotten pushed to be the most worthy person to be on Nambonan’s council.  

  I heard that they don’t traditionally have female council members ever, but she has so much support from the people that she could blow that tradition away.

「Miss Anna is really a wonderful woman」

  Rumon said that while he exhaled in admiration, then he started to talk about Anna passionately even though I didn’t ask.  

  Anna, who works energetically at a place of relaxation for the citizens seems to be originally popular amongst the men of the city. The traditional clothing she wears that is similar to an Oktoberfest costume has probably become a nice side dish of fap material for the people. She’s an outstanding waitress who doesn’t only serve people snacks to go with the drinks, but even some snacks for their night as well. 

  When I think about that, my desire to monopolize her starts to spill out. I want to jizz all over her and mark her as my woman.   

  By the way, according to the rumors, it’s pretty much for certain that Anna will be elected. It’s like the people don’t even consider voting for anyone else other than her.

  Many citizens also seem to call her “The fairy of Nambonan”, and the tavern she works at has been packed day after day.

  After I inspected the important places of the city, I let Rumon and the civil officer go, and then I headed for the tavern with just my guards.

  Under this cold sky, many civilians were drinking alcohol at the tables that are set outside of the tavern. When they saw me, some were frightened, but most threw me welcoming words.

  The owner also welcomed me timidly and prepared a table for me inside. He was about to tell Anna to pour me drinks out of consideration, but there is a hostess bar there. Since I saw that Anna is working, I told him it’s alright.

  The waitresses were moving around between the tables.

  There were many girls who look quite younger than Anna, but they still aren’t as charming as she is. She is truly attractive when she continues to bring alcohol around vivaciously with her skilled movements.

   When I think about how she’s one of my women, I started to feel good, and the pace with which I drank my tea increased.

  As I thought about when I should bring Anna to my bed, I ordered another cup of tea.

Chapter 100: Enjoying The Poster Girl I Called Out to The Mayor’s Residence(⅓) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  “I’m going to make your pussy take the shape of my cock”- that is an expression that comes out frequently in stuff like ero-manga. There’s no way that a vagina would change into the shape of a cock no matter how many times a cock goes in there, but it’s one of those lines that gets me quite excited. 

  Now, suppose the theory of a pussy changing its shape due to a penis is real, the women I have slept with would have had their vagina reshaped based on the number of times I slept with them. So then who would be the one with a pussy that is the closest to the shape of my cock?

  The answer would be Anna.

  For approximately more than 20 days since the tavern rape after Nambonan was conquered, I slept with Anna almost every day. In the morning, the afternoon, and of course, at night too. I think I came inside her at least 3 times a day.

  At that time, I only had my first sexual experience with Eve and my 2nd taste of sex with Minith, so I was a monkey who had nothing but sex in my head. Now my “monkeyness” has more or less gone…I think.

  During my stay in Nambonan, Anna definitely always had the stench of semen.

  Therefore, if I were to make a leaderboard for the women I slept with based on the number of times they slept with me, the number one spot would surely belong to Anna.

  As Anna continued to accept the sex that I had just recently learned day after day, an overflowing emotion was born in my chest. 

  Since she had lost her husband, she’s not taken right now. If that’s the case, I want to lock her in as my woman completely.

  According to Rumon, Anna is very popular in the city, so men who had lost their spouse like she did might hit on her. If I want to claim her, I should probably make my move quickly.

  After I gave the tavern owner some words to pass on, I returned to the mayor’s residence, then I had dinner and took a bath.

  I made sure that the bedroom looks good, then I started warming up by moving my hips back and forth.

  When I was going round and round like I was doing hula hoops, the door was knocked on by Odie.

  「Young master. Miss Anna has arrived」

  「Alright, bring her to me」

  Anna is 26 years old and Odie is 25. What does Odie think of me sleeping with a woman who is in the latter half of her 20s? I’m a little curious. 

  The biggest reason why I called Anna all the way here to the mayor’s residence is that I want to take my time to make love to her, but another reason is because I also want to see how Odie will react.  

  From what I saw, it doesn’t seem like Odie thinks much of it. She had her usual serious maid face on.

  I was left in the bedroom by myself after Odie went out to get Anna.

  The mayor’s residence is divided into my living zone and the work zone where staff can also enter. Since Kohali and her brother’s room is in the work zone, Kohali will not run into Anna.

  It’s not like there’s a reason for me to hide this from Kohali, but it’s not something I want to show off either. All I need to show off to Kohali is my cock.

  *Knock* *knock*, the door was lightly knocked on. When I gave my permission to enter, Anna was standing there.

  「Mayor」

  「Nice, you’re here. Come in」

  I didn’t just tell her to come to the mayor’s residence, I told her to come with her tavern’s work clothes on.

  Perhaps she ran here; she entered the room with her adorable traditional clothing while being just slightly short of breath.  

  I want to take that piece of cloth by her chest off right away and stuff my face into her breasts, but I’m still holding myself back. I tapped on the bed to tell her to come take a seat here.

  「Anna, I’ve missed you」

  「Ahh……」

  When I hugged Anna with all my strength, I smelled the delicious scent of something like grilled meat from her clothes. It really makes me feel that she’s the Anna I know who works at the tavern.

  After I pressed my nose on her body and took a deep breath, I smelled the fragrance of her sweat in the midst of that aromatic scent.

  「Ahh, wait, please don’t smell me too much…I stink…」

  「No such thing. I love your scent」

  I had told her before to not be too polite and reserved towards me when we’re in bed. It seems that she still properly remembers our promise from before.

  When she talks to me in her waitress’s appearance with an easygoing tone, I started to become excited because it feels like we’re roleplaying.

  I started to feel up her body as I sniffed her nostalgic body scent, and then I put my hand in the pocket of her clothes.

  Did she realize that I wasn’t groping her but looking for something with my hands? A question mark surfaced on Anna’s face.

  「Mayor? Are you looking for something?」

  「Contraceptives」

  Even a maiden like Lupetta could easily get her hands on contraceptives, so it’s highly possible that Anna would have some.

  I can’t help it since I want to get her pregnant.

  「I’m confiscating them if you have any. Bring them out」

  Anna silently put her hand on her waist. There seems to be a small pocket by her waist as well.  

  「……This is it」

  A small wooden box was in the palm of her hand that she opened to show me. Anna’s hand is a little chapped, probably because of the chores she does at the tavern.

  When I opened the small box, there was a pink-colored powder inside. It’s the same thing that Lupetta uses, contraceptive medicine made from Killsieshi.

  「Haa……」

  I let out a sigh instinctively.

  My relationship with Anna did start from the rape at the tavern, so it looks like she didn’t trust me after all. I thought my likability would have gone up quite a bit since I allowed Nambonan to be self-governed, but it looks like that was just in my own head. 

  So there’s no such thing as love that starts from rape, huh?

  「Umm……I’m sorry. I, um, I’m scared……」

  「Scared?」

  After she said that, Anna put her hand over her stomach.

  「You know I was married, right?」

  「Yeahh」

  Anna was married, but I heard from the tavern owner that her husband had passed away due to an epidemic two years ago.

  It’s hard to imagine it because she’s always showing her energetic bright smile at the tavern, but Anna is a widow.

  In the first place, there’s no way that a 26-year-old woman who is as good as her is unmarried. She started working at the tavern since she was 6 years old, and I’m sure she had been flooded with marriage proposals from when she was my age, no, maybe even before that. Since she seems to be popular with the men of the city, surely she had a lot of options to choose from.

  「I got married when I was around 13」

  「……Mm?」

  「Have you realized it? I-I don’t have any children」

  The fact that Anna married at 13 and still doesn’t even have a single child at 26 is strange. Normal citizens would have their first child after a few years of being married.

  According to her, her firstborn was a miscarriage, her 2nd child was stillborn, then her third, and fourth seem to have all been miscarriages as well.

  「I’m scared…to have a baby die again……」

  Anna’s husband was madly in love with her. He cared for Anna who was scared to have more miscarriages and told her that it’s fine even if she can’t give birth to a child.

  Then after a while, he died because of an epidemic.

  「I didn’t mean to make you talk about something painful」

  I hugged Anna who had a sad look on her face. I’m not a man who can’t read the mood to the point where I’ll rub her breasts and ass in this situation.

  「It’s fine, it’s already such a long time ago. But…having a baby is still scary for me even now. I apologize for using contraceptive in secret, sorry, *fmm*」

  I blocked her mouth with my finger in the middle of her apology.

  It’s not unreasonable for her to be scared of getting pregnant in such circumstances.

  I’m a bit sad that she didn’t come to consult me about it, but she might have thought that it wouldn’t matter anyway since I turned into a horny monkey.

  「Anna. There’s something I want you to tell me. Answer me honestly」

  「Okay」

  「Do you like children?」

  When I first met her, she picked up a small remark I made with her sharp ears and spoke to me. 

  I don’t really want to sound rude, but my guards who were sitting next to me at that time had some really scary faces on since they were on alert partly because we just took control of Nambonan. It was a mystery why Anna would go out of her way to talk to me there.

  I am 12 years old. If her first child was born, I think he or she would be around my age. A child like that was surrounded by scary-looking men in a tavern that had an unsettling atmosphere because Nambonan lost in the war. I feel like she called out to me because she was worried about me.

  Today, I watched Anna work and noticed that she is very attentive towards kids. Her smiles to them were so gentle that it was obvious that she likes children.

  The tavern Anna works at also sells standalone liquor, so sometimes kids would be sent there on errands to buy some for their parents.

  「I…I like them, you know? In the past…I thought about adopting one too」

  「I see」

  Basically, she wants children but she is scared of miscarriages.

  I put my hand on her hand that was on her stomach, and then I put my other arm around her shoulder and pulled her to me.

  「Anna, give birth to my children」

  「Ehhh……? But, I…」

  She looked at me with an expression as if she’s asking me if I heard what she just said, but I paid no mind to that.

  I then let her know that I plan to call some healers to the city of Nambonan to help with the pregnancy care.

  「Healers?!」

  「Yes. If you become pregnant, they will attend to you until you give birth. If you are still uneasy with that, you can come to the City of Nyuneri. There are healers who specialize in pregnancy and childbirth there」 

  「T-there’s no w-…」

  「I can do it. Who do you think I am?」

  I held Anna’s shaking hands and continued to speak.

  「I will definitely assign a healer to you. I keep my promises」

  「Mayor, you did protect the city of Nambonan. …I don’t think you are a liar」

  The day of the election has been announced and I made the things I declared happen. Surprisingly, Anna’s trust in me seems to have gone up.  

 

  「But mayor and I have an age gap like a mother and child」

  From her point of view, it wouldn’t even be weird for me to be her kid.

  It’s only natural that she would be mindful of this since she’s trapped by the norms of the continent of Elluo, but there’s no problem for me since to me Anna is just a 26-year-old woman. When it comes to safe childbirth, a grown woman around her age would probably be just right, wouldn’t it?  

  「So what? My feelings for you have nothing to do with our age. You would only have to worry if we were actually connected by blood」 

  「Feelings? Ah…*kiss*」

  When I pressed my lips on hers, Anna accepted my body weight without resisting.

  My chest that is touching hers feels so nice. I moved my tongue violently and enjoyed this long-missed kiss with her.

  「*Kiss*…*Kiss*! *Haaa*, Anna……」

  「Nm. Mayor」

  We looked in each other’s eyes at point-blank range, and then I lightly pecked her lips next.

  I took both of her hands and raised them a bit higher.

  「Anna. I like you. I want you to have my baby」

  「Mayor……」

  「Do you know about the power of healing magic? I’ll show it to you」

  I activated healing magic on her palms.

  Her hands that had become chapped from doing chores were enveloped by a faint light instantly. Then after the light disappeared, what was there was a pair of beautifully healed-up hands.

  「I-Incredible……!」

  She was shocked by the effects of the healing magic as she rotated her hands. Commoners almost have zero chance to meet any healers. This seems to be her first time experiencing being healed.

  「This is the power that will protect you and your child」

  「Ahhh……with this……」

  After she said that, big marble-like teardrops dripped down from Anna’s close to gray-colored eyes.

  The general consensus the people have in the continent of Elluo is that a woman who can’t give birth is not even a real woman. She must have had negative thoughts because of that all this time.

  As I hugged Anna, she returned my hug with her arms around my back like she was clinging to me.

Chapter 101: Enjoying The Poster Girl I Called Out to The Mayor’s Residence(⅔)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  After Anna hugged me, I buried my face in those breasts of hers.

  Since she’s moderately taller than me, I fit into her cleavage perfectly.

  The scent of a grown female and her body temperature that was transmitted to me from her soft breasts through the fabric of her clothes was raising my excitement rapidly.

  I put my hand on her arm, and then I looked up at her with my face still sandwiched in her valley.

  「Anna, you’re going to give birth to a child for me, okay?」

  I asked her with the intention of getting her confirmation rather than finding out about her will. Since I will impregnate her if she says no anyway even if it’s by force, it’s not like I had ever given her a choice.

  「Yes. …I can…trust you, right?」

  I can tell that Anna had put more strength into her hands that were wrapped around my back.

  If she accepts to come under my protection here, it would be a huge turning point in her life. But for a mere commoner to become a noble’s concubine means that she might need even more courage than she would need in marrying someone in case things don’t go well.

  「Of course. I will never abandon you」

  I might have looked cool with that line alone, but I am still sandwiched between her breasts right now. Since my serious line did not match the soft and bouncy situation I’m in, I ended up trying to hold myself back from laughing.

  Anna seems to have thought of the same thing as well as she had a small chuckle.

  「Heheh, how cool of you. …I’m going to trust you, okay?」

  「Yeahh, believe in me」

  This time, I took my face away from her chest and gave her a firm kiss.

  Then, I started touching her body lightly. I felt her breasts up repeatedly, rubbed her back, and massaged her butt.  

  「Anna……」

  From that alone, Anna seemed to have understood what I’m asking her to do.

  「Yup」

  I heard that Anna never had oral sex with her husband.

  Because of that, she was astonished when I first asked her to give me a blowjob. To her, a sexual organ is not something that licks or gets licked.  

  「It-it has already become so big……」

  「That’s because you smell so good」

  However, that was a long time ago.

  During my last stay here, I had asked Anna to give me head many times. It’s because I could see her innocent side in oral sex. The feeling of invading her first sexual experience that hasn’t been trampled on by her late husband fulfills my desire to conquer.

  She showed a strong sense of refusal towards having my cock in her mouth at first, but she ended up getting used to it quickly as well. It’s probably only natural since I forced her to lick it every day, morning, noon, and night. We even developed a silent understanding of “our sex begins with fellatio” between us before I left Nambonan.

  It looks like she didn’t forget about that.

  As I looked at those lips of hers, I could no longer hold myself back.

  I took my pants off and threw them to the side, and then I shoved my stiff, erect cock in front of her like I’m showing it off to her.

  「The usual?」

  「Yeahh, go for it」

  After I said that, Anna got up from the bed and sat down on the floor before me. I spread my legs open as I sat on the bed and welcomed her in.

  She then stuck out her red-colored tongue with just its tip showing.

  「Nnn……」

  She stuck her tongue on my balls and then licked up my erect penis following its curve.

  Her tongue that slowly went up the center of the underside of the penis in a tantalizing manner stopped at the glans, then it moved delicately as if it was tickling the groove of the frenulum.

  「Ohhh……」

  「Nmn, nnn-….*Lick*…」

  I can feel Anna’s slight heat from where she’s licking me probably because the temperature of her tongue is high.

  I just want to shove my whole tip in her mouth like this. I want to be enveloped in her warmth.

  But whether she knows that or not, she started to move her tongue even higher without taking my cock in her mouth.

  「*Kisss*…*lick* ♡」

  Anna pecked at my pee hole with her tongue and rubbed my balls and the base of my shaft with her hands.

  She teased my cock lewdly with her hands. It feels like she’s proudly thinking to herself about how she’s the one who got me this hard.

  My penis trembled up and down as it protested in silence in this situation where I’m put just a step away from feeling really good.

  Anna looked at my penis and smiled once as if she was looking at a child who is being unreasonable, and then she looked up at me.

  「Ahhhm」

  With the sound of her mouth closing, she took in my cock from its tip to the glans.

  The inside of her mouth wrapped around the tip of my cock comfortably, probably because she made her mouth tighter. I feel a warmth that’s similar to when I was wetting the bed as a baby.

  「Nnn, nnn-nnnnn*kiss*……♡ *Slurp*……」

  Her tongue was picking at the space between where the skin rolls up and the glans. It was as if she was scrapping any smegma in the gap.

  I washed myself thoroughly so it shouldn’t be dirty there, but it’s just a little embarrassing.

  「Mnn*kiss*……Nmnn-, *sip*, *slurp*」

  As the watery sounds echoed, the inside of Anna’s mouth swept over my cock over and over as she moved her head in a circular motion.

  My cock ignored my will and trembled faintly to the horrifying pleasure.

  「That’s good Anna……Uaah……♡」

  「*Slurpslurp*, *kiss*」

  After she got into a good pace, she began to use the entirety of her mouth to stimulate my cock.

  She gradually increased the amount of cock she was taking into her mouth until more than half of my shaft went in.

  When I stared into her eyes, she seemed to have noticed me. She smiled back as she looked up at me, but instead of words, she replied with small flicks with her tongue.

  「*Haaa*……Uuu, ahhh, good……Anna, ahhhh, Anna, you’re the best」

  「Nmmm ♡」

  As I watched her suck on my cock, I started to think about how precious she is.

  Even though she hasn’t given me head in a long time, it doesn’t feel like she got any worse at it.

  Perhaps it’s because she slowly started to remember about my weak spots; every time she changed her sucking rhythm, my cock was given a heavenly stimulation.

  「*Kiss*……*suck*……*kiss*…*nmmggm*…Nmm ♡」

  At last, Anna had taken my entire cock in her mouth.

  My grown pubic hair had probably slightly gone in her nose since she looks like she’s being tickled.

  The sensation of her teeth slightly touching my cock was bringing me a superb feeling of pleasure.

  「Ughh……That’s good」

  As I looked down at the head of the beauty who is buried in my crotch sucking my cock in a trance, not only was I getting sexual stimulation directly, this visual was raising my sense of superiority as a man and getting me aroused.

  The gesture of her brushing her hair behind her ear with one of her hands like a comb truly gives a nice blowjob vibe.

  In order to praise her and tell her I want to go even deeper in her mouth, I caressed the back of her head.

  「Anna……You belong to me. I’m not going to hand you over to anyone else」

  「Hmfmm……*Suckk*……*suckk*……*kiss*, *Kissuckk*……♡」

  Anna started to dance with her tongue again in response to my caressing, igniting excitement as it stuck to my cock.

  I leaned forward a little and reached my hand out at her breasts. The fabric of her chest area was coming a bit loose; it was as if her breasts were telling me to touch them.

  「Oohh, so soft……」

  I unintentionally compared them to Kohali’s breasts that I just touched last night in my head.

  Kohali is still a young girl if anything, so it’s normal that Anna’s breasts would be more feminine. Even in the elasticity department, Anna’s breasts have the elasticity of a woman’s. It’s a pair of breasts with softness that seems to cling to my fingers as I rub them. 

  Although there are good things about a younger girl’s breasts as well, the softness of these ones that I could proclaim as ideal makes them so mouth-wateringly delicious. Her breasts have an overflowing charm that makes me not only want to touch them, but suck on them as well. 

  Even though I’m in the middle of enjoying her breasts with my hands, Anna continued her caress going from the bottom to the top of my cock while making use of her tongue.

  It started to change into a moderate piston movement exercise that made use of her whole mouth, and along with that, her breathing started to become rough as well.

  「Nnn……nnnn……nn……Haa, *huff*, *huff*, *kiss*, nnnn…nnnnnn……」

  As her traditional clothing that resembles an Oktoberfest costume shook, Anna gobbled up my cock that was in desperation.

  Those things continued to make my cock harder at an accelerated pace, moving me closer to climax at the same time.

  「Ughhh……Anna, A-Anna, stop……」

  At this rate, thoughts of wanting to dump my semen in her mouth are going to fill my head.

  Maybe she can tell that my penis is shifting to ejaculation mode, so she pressed her sticky tongue on the back of my cock and started applying pressure on it. 

  My cock that feels like it was getting crushed by her elastic tongue became drunk on that sensation, then it began to tremble slightly like semen was about to come out. 

  「Wait, ughh……」

  「Mmn……? *Kiss* ahhh ♡」

  In the middle of the intoxicating pleasure, I put my hands on Anna’s forehead and pulled my cock away.

  My cock that is drenched in saliva and glowing from the illumination magic that is shining on it shook as it yearned for her mouth.

  However, I can’t shoot my semen in her mouth. That’s because I want to plant all my seeds in her vagina today.

  「Anna. Get on the bed」

  「……You sure?」

  「Yeahh」

  Anna attempted to take her clothes off when I tried to get her on the bed. That’s probably because she knows that what we’re going to do next is going to involve us mixing our body fluids together, but I stopped her and told her to lay on the bed on her back with her clothes on.

  I purposely told her to come here keeping those adorable clothes on. There’s no reason for her to take them off yet.

  「Hohhh」

 She wouldn’t normally take them off when we have sex in the waiting room of the tavern, but it’s the first time we’re doing a costume play on the bed. 

  I feel a sense of indecency that I cannot really put into words as I looked at her lay there on the bed we use for sex with her usual clothes on. There’s an exquisite eroticness that keeps on wandering between the boundary of ordinary and extraordinary.

  My cock was also greatly satisfied by her appearance as a sticky body fluid that is not saliva discharged from its tip.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 102: Enjoying The Poster Girl I Called Out to The Mayor’s Residence 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anna lying on her back in bed is staring at me while wiping the saliva on her mouth with her hands.

　She’s still wearing an Oktoberfest-style folk costume, and I’m naked with my pants down. It seems kind of stupid that I’m the only one half-naked.

　I approached her lying down and gently stroked her cheeks.

“Anna … *Kiss*”

“*Kiss*”

　Gently kissing her, I put my hand to her skirt.

　Aim for underwear by crawling my fingers like the hornworm moves. The plump thighs were slightly sweaty and moisturized.

　When my fingers reached the underwear that looked like my shorts were swollen, I searched for a gap and headed further inside.

“Hmm?”

“Oh, don’t…..”

　A slimy, wet feel is transmitted to my fingers.

　She seems to be completely ready to accept me, even though I haven’t touched her much yet.

“Anna?”

“I, I don’t know!”

　The wetness seemed make her embarrassed, and she covered her face with both hands. Her reaction like an innocent girl is cute.

　If she are ready to accept, I would like to move on to f**k her as it is. With her blowjob, my cock is already full awake.

　I stopped touching with my fingers and moved to her lower body side. I decided to take off her underwear at once.

“Hey, raise your hips.”

“It’s embarrassing …”

　Anna hated it a little, but as soon as I stimulated her genitals from the top of her underwear, she became quiet and stopped resisting.

　I raise the skirt to reveal underwear that has no sex appeal or dullness. And lifted her hips on her back with M-shaped spread legs and slipped her underwear down at once.

“Kyaaa!”

　Anna tries to hide her crotch using her hand, but I prevent it. Feeling the movement to close the M-shape, I hold Anna’s knees in my hand.

　Apply ligh magic to the most important part of Anna who is exposed and observe it carefully.

　Anna’s female genitals, which resemble a single shell, make me strongly aware of the words, “adult sister.” The nasty shape excites the man inside me violently.

　The light pubic hair is evidence that she is no longer owned by another man. Perhaps it’s because I’ve become accustomed to the customs of the Eruo (TLN:エルオ) continent that the desire for exclusivity burst out.

“Anna, let me see it more”

“Ahhhhh, it’s embarrassed … don’t look too much …!”

　I felt a strong force of she try to close her crotch again, but I slipped my arm to prevent it.

　I was told not to look, so I took a closer look and Anna’s genitals were moving even though I hadn’t touched it. It’s like whispering that it wants an offspring.

“Did you lick my thing and it ended up like this?”

“Oh, don’t make me say it …!”

　This time I called her with the intention of holding her gently, but it is a man’s heart that makes me want to mess with her.

　I put my mouth to her ear and whispered to her at a close distance.

“Did you want a younger boy’s dick? What a naughty older sister.”

“Its… oh … tha.. that not….”

　Perhaps of her shyness, she moves her legs and tries to deny my words.

　But the wet pubic area can no longer be hidden. As if to say what this was, I stimulated her genitals with my fingers and squeaked the sound of wetness.

“You don’t have to be shy. You think of me and fell it right?”

　When I bring my face close to her crotch, the smell becomes stronger. But it’s not unpleasant, but rather an exciting scent.

　While gently caressing the clitoris, which was small and lewd, with my fingers, I leaned over and kissed her.

　I’m going to enjoy it in the missionary position while kissing a lot.

“*Kiss* … *Kiss* …”

“*Kiss…..kiss..*”

　Rub the tip of a cowper sticky meat stick against her labia. Anna’s pubic area is well wet, so it should work well as a lubricant.

　Anna stared at me and nodded silently. That gesture grabbed my heart.

　I put a meat stick on the ostium of the vagina with the desire to be one with her.

“I’m going to put it in, Anna. Feel me.”

“Yes”

　I slowly sink down, but it seems that the wet condition is still good. It slips in slippery.

　My cock wrapped in her vagina received a fierce welcome of heat and pressure.

　It’s a skilled female body who has already experienced fertilization and implantation four times, and my penis seems to be taken by a handball.

“Hmm … mmm … ahhh ……… ♡”

　Feeling that I had arrived at the innermost part of my vagina, I took a breather and stared at Anna.

　I put my hand on her shoulder and started kissing her while pulling her towards me. Taste the feel of lightly matched lips, stretch my tongue and entangle hers.

“*Kiss* … *Kiss*, *kissss*”

“*Kiss*, *kiss..kiss..kiss..puah* ♡ *kiss..kiss. kissss* ♡”

　Her vagina flutters to match the stimulus of a kiss, tightening to rob me of her offspring.

　I thought that this pleasure would end immediately as it was, so I reached for her clitoris and started attacking there.

“Ahhh ♡”

　I once learned how to handle a female body by forcibly holding Anna in the middle. The know-how gained there is used as a reference when embracing other women.

　My caress technique was basically based on Anna.

　Apparently her weaknesses were remembered by my fingers, and when I struck some of her spot, she gasped in a funny way. (TLN:”どうやら彼女の弱い部分は指が覚えていたようで” pretty weird line)

“Ahhh ♡ Ah ♡ Yaan ♡ Kufu … Noo ♡ Ah ♡ Kuuhh ♡”

　I move my hips while continuing to stimulate with my fingers, and start a gentle piston movement to thoroughly taste Anna’s vaginal wall.

　It gradually increased in speed, and the rubbing sounds of male and female genitalia, the swaying sound of the bed, and Anna’s lustrous voice echoed in the room.

“Hmm ♡ yeah ♡ uuuh ♡ ah ♡ ah ah!”

“Uuuh, uuuh! Anna!”

　Holding both hands, I move my hips even faster.

“Ahhhhh ♡ Ahhhhh ♡ Ah! Ah! Ah!”

　Shaking my hips, I felt the first climax running up to my brain.

　Anna raises a high-pitched voice in my attack while disturbing her cute costume. Anna is drowning in pleasure, moving her head to slam her bright orange hair against the bed.

“Anna, I’m about to come…! Kuuh!”

　When I declared ejaculation, Anna’s hand tied with mine got stronger.

　I piled up with her as if I was drawn to her, and I leading to ejaculation at once.

“Mayor U Agu ♡ Mayor ♡ Ah, back, more, more back is better ♡ Oku! Ah ♡ Guu ♡ Higu ♡”

　I felt Anna put her legs around my waist. When I was aware of her being in a position to accept my sperm, my body entered the final stage of seeding.

　Prompted by the explosive desire to ejaculate, I pierced my penis at once at her womb.

“Ah ♡”

“Anna!”

　The next moment, Anna lifted her body to jump at me, waved her hand and hugged me. That is the last push.

“Guuh! Oh, Anna! Take it!”

　Byubyubyu! My offspring is planted in Anna’s vagina.

　I hugged her with all my might and buried her face in her breasts so that I would never miss her ejaculation.

“Ah! Ah! Ah ah ah.”

　I never let Anna go until the ejaculation is done. So I put a lot of effort into my arms to hug her.

　Then Anna shook her whole body and spilled an unvoiced pant.

“A ♡ A ♡ A ♡ Ah … U ♡ Ogu … ♡”

“Anna …! Take my child … Anna, my Anna …! Huh! Huh! Guu”

“Hah ♡ Hah …… ♡ A ♡ Uku …… ♡”

　The rest of the semen spilled from her vagina, as if squeezing the residual urine…

　My semen is sucked up by the rhythmic contraction.

　Anna, who keeps accepting my offspring while quivering my back, becomes sexually adorable, and I kiss her to push my saliva.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 103: Enjoying The Poster Girl I Called Out to The Mayor’s Residence (after)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With our passionate fellowship, I was lying close to Anna.

Since I took off my clothes from the middle and became naked with each other, our sweaty skin stuck to each other.

Recognizing my presence with her bare skin, she asked my lips with a mix of her rough breath.

“Good, Anna”

“Hahi …”

It was excitement from meeting after a long time or fierce copulation that was like marking. It is hard to breathe because of the power I entrusted to my physical strength.

Of course, she also seemed to be climaxing several times, so I think we could have enjoyed each other just by looking at the results.

“It has been squeezed in large quantities.”

It’s not good for seeding that semen splashes out of the vagina every time you do a piston movement, but tonight it’s okay because the main purpose was to remind Anna’s vagina of my cock.

If we want to make a baby, we can do it many times from now on.

“It was awesome”

“I’m so glad … ♡”

Anna approached me to bury her face in my chest, so I just hugged her head. Her hair rubs against my bare skin and tickles a little.

Looking at Anna, who regulates her turbulent breathing in my arms, I could feel that her words were what she really meant.

“Fufu, you’re really cute Anna”

The appearance is lovely, and I stroke her orange hair a little wildly.

When I stayed in Nambonan last time, I felt that I would be in lovey lovey mode in just one step, but as a result of that step, I feel like I fell to the bottom of the cliff at once.

Anna, who moves her face from side to side while groaning, is like a girl who loves her lover. It was irresistible to see an adult woman like her spoiled.

Anna whispers to me in a vague tone, perhaps because she feels tired after having sex.

“Please protect my child …?”

I flatly rejected the request.

She didn’t think I would be rejected, but I smiled at Anna with a startled expression, making full use of my handsome face.

“Not only the child but also Anna. I will protect the entire city of Nambonan. Rest assured.”

Now I have the backbone to say that word without hesitation.

In a confident remark, Anna turned her face red like a maiden who fell in love for the first time and pressed her head all the way against my chest. Apparently, the dependable man appeal went well.

I put my finger through Anna’s hair and comb it. Her hair is long enough to fit on her shoulders, but it seems to be well maintained and not bad to the touch.

Anna with my arm as her pillow was staring at me. I was sucked into her lips right in front of me and kissed her lightly.

“Kiss ♡”

“… Kiss. Anna. Do you want to sleep like this today?”

Nyuneri (TLN: ニューネリー) has two beds in both the castle and the villa. A sex bed and a sleeping bed.

However, the Mayor’s residence in Nambonan is currently under renovation, so there is still only one bed.

With Tesh and Ody coming in, the work will go at once, but tonight I have no choice but to sleep in a fluid-covered bed. And I didn’t feel like taking a bath.

“Yes … but let’s talk a little more, alright?”

“That’s right. I want to hear Anna’s story.”

Feeling the comfortable fatigue after ejaculation and the heat transmitted from Anna’s skin, I talked to Anna in a vague mood.

Until now, I rarely had a slow conversation in bed, which made me feel fresh.

Anna waited for me to get in shape and started talking slowly.

“… I was very scared at first, right?”

“Uuu… that brings back memories”

The story began with a rape story at a bar when I met Anna for the first time.

She didn’t think there was a member of the Koldenze family, and when she was accused of speaking ill to me it felt like she was on the brink of death.

Anna talked about her rape experience and stared at me.

“I like the gentle mayor …”

Kyu, my hand grasped, and Anna spins words further.

After she was raped in the bar, Anna was relieved to learn that her rudeness was forgiven.

It seems to be lucky for the commoners to be allowed to have sex with a nobleman. This is all the more so given that all the guests in the bar could have been decapitated, given that they had been at war just a while ago.

Anna didn’t think she would be involved with the aristocrats anymore, but as she knows, I asked for her body every day.

“Every day, I’m so happy”

At first, Anna couldn’t help but hate having sex, but she said she felt a little emotional when she saw me coming to see her with a smile every day.

The feeling that was born in this way grew in proportion to the length of the day. I declared that I would take responsibility if she became pregnant and did not demand unreasonable play other than blowjobs, but it seems this was also good.

“… There are a lot of other young and beautiful people, but I was asked so many times … I feel a little more confident in myself.”

Anna, who was once married, knows that men’s semen is limited. I was pouring the precious semen more than three times a day. Best of all, I’m not looking at other women.

For Anna, who is approaching an age called older women, it seems to have comfortably filled her self-esteem.

A young boy is absorbed in her body and shakes his hips. It’s not uncommon to see such a figure.

“Anna … kiss“

“Kiss ♡”

When we put our lips on top of each other, Anna puts her tongue in and entangles it.

Gently kiss the slugs as if they were mating, and then let go.

“Puha …. Be confident. You’re mine already.”

“Yes”

I once asked Anna for a tourist guide to the city of Nambonan.

This is just my hobby, but from Anna’s point of view, she looks like a good aristocrat who wants to know more about the city of Nambonan.

As a result, the local autonomy of Nambonan continued. Anna said she came to trust me completely there.

“There was a little calculation, but …”

Since the aristocrats take responsibility, if they have children, they may get a few gold coins. Besides, since it is a child with an aristocrat, a child with magical power will be born. If you are a commoner with magical power, you will not have any trouble in your life, so you will not have a hard time in your life as a mother and child. If you are surrounded as a concubine, you can live a better life than ever before.

Anna said playfully that there were only a few such calculations. It was an idol-like way of talking in a bar, saying that in bed and it’s okay to have a little vaginal cum shot.

It’s a rude remark depending on what you hear, but it’s also proof that she trusts me. I’m very happy about that.

Again, the faces of me and Anna overlapped, and the sound of overlapping each other’s lips echoed in the room.

“By the way, I have something to ask.”

“what is it?”

“Does Anna like the city of Nambonan? Is it better to continue living here than to go to Nyuneri?”

On the continent of Eruo, it is rare to move from the municipality where you were born and raised. Therefore, I thought that I might be reluctant to move.

I will continue to come to Nambonan City from time to time, and I feel that it doesn’t change much whether I come to Nyuneri City or stay in Nambonan City. It is not very realistic to take a horse-drawn carriage every time you change bases.

When I explained it, Anna smiled at me.

“I was just thinking about that story. That story about me being a candidate for council …”

“I see”

I somehow thought that Anna wasn’t willing to do that, but the people around her were enthusiastic, but surprisingly Anna was motivated.

It seems to be a great honor to be elected in the city of Nambonan. Well, it’s proof that it’s loved by the inhabitants, so I’m proud of it.

“… So I will be a member of the council …. if I was chosen, right?”

“Hmm. Isn’t that good?”

It’s a different story whether the bar girl can do politics, but the councilor elected is not required to have specialized knowledge. All you have to do is be honest with your citizens. With regard to city management, a strong nominated member will make a policy.

In other words, when Anna becomes a counselor, she only has to judge whether she is in favor or against the measures taken by the nominated councilor.

“Is it okay?”

“Oh. Anna works in a bar right? There are different kinds of people in the bar. Anna should be familiar with it. It is the representative of the city who knows the opinions of different people. I think it’s important as is.”

Anna is getting a lot of information from the guests who visit the bar, probably because of the chatty waitress. The city of Nambonan is visited by many continental merchants, so Anna was also an informed person throughout the continent, from the Kingdom of Levios (TLN: ジンカーエン) to the east, the Empire of Zinkaen (TLN: ジンカーエン) to the west, and the Federation of Mamshred (TLN: マムシュレッド) to the south.

When I asked Anna to guide me to the city, she showed me a lot of small stories and thought she was a good talker.

“I’m glad. I was wondering if I would be told it wasn’t good.”

“No, if you want to do it, do it. I was attracted to the lively Anna.”

Anna who moves actively is the most attractive and attractive. It doesn’t make sense to make her mine if you surround it in the mayor’s room and lose it.

I like the energetic Anna.

“Attracted … that’s right … ♡”

Anna puts one hand on her cheek and smiles.

“If you want to live in Nambonan as it is, I will prepare Anna’s room in the mayor’s residence. Arrange for a healer.”

Then I reached for Anna’s crotch.

There are pubic hairs wet with body fluids. I picked up the hair and pulled it lightly.

“That’s why Anna prepares too. Is there anything I can do for you?”

Implying that she wants to shave.

A woman’s pubic hair shaving is also a statement of her determination to live with a particular man.

“… Is it okay?”

“Naturally …. I’ll give you a razor that cuts well later. Will you accept it?”

It is not uncommon for commoners to give a razor to a proposal. It’s a big deal, so I tried to match it.

Anna nodded silently and approached me.

Next time, I’ll be able to enjoy the shaved Anna.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 104 Koldenze family Manalal mine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the sun rose, Anna went home as soon as she had breakfast. She says he will work in a bar in the afternoon, so she needs to prepare for it.

It seems that the number of visitors to the bar is increasing because it is the birthplace of the rumored story that flows in Nambonan City.

Anna said she would like to work for a while to give back her help.

For the next few days, I went on a tour of the city, processing my work.

Perhaps she had a desire to become pregnant, Anna became more willing to act, and I went to her house and bar every day to release my libido.

Anna was originally in first place in the number of times she received my semen, but it will be far further away from the second place, Minith.

“Mayor, the carriage is ready.”

“Oh, I understand.”

When I saw the appearance of Rumon entering the mayor’s office, He dressed like it was okay for the clothes to be dirty afterward.
We are planning to visit the outskirts of Nambonan today, and we are preparing to accompany by Rumon.

“How far was it?”

“It’s about a day to go and go home. It will be in time for tomorrow’s elections.”

All the materials have been brought into the carriage by the civilians and Rumon, so it seems that I can just get on and leave.

I turned my eyes to Ody, who was waiting next to me and decided to ask him about today’s schedule.

“What are Tesh and Ody doing?”

“Mainly selecting employees and instructing renovation.”

Junior employees are hired in each city. Even if the master is absent, the labor cost seems to be wasted because he is still hired, but it is indispensable to maintain the mansion regularly, and when the master comes, he is invisible as an aristocrat. Employment is essential.

According to Ody, the mayor’s residence is currently recruiting junior servants to take care of me. Certainly, there are only Tesh and Ody as they are, and it will be difficult to keep turning the chore clerk.

At the same time, the mayor’s residence is being renovated and refurbished. The mayor’s residence was originally Kohari’s parents’ house and private house, so it is necessary to change it to suit the aristocrats. My bedroom will also be refurbished to make it even easier to hold a woman.

I left the mayor’s residence, hoping that a cute maid would be hired.

Today, I will be visiting as a member of the Koldenze family, not as the mayor of Nambonan, so I wouldn’t normally take Rumon. He is just a city official in the city of Nambonan.

However, the mine we visited this time was owned by Rumon’s father’s company until just the other day. He said that he had visited the mine several times when he was a merchant, so he brought this time for commentary.

Depart from Nambonan City and arrive at the mine in less than half a day.

I was guided to a building with a roof while being looked at by the miners in a strange way. It is said that it is a facility where the person who supervises the miner sleeps.

“Soon after my dad bought this mine, Mamshred introduced the technology for manalal ore.”

Rumon opened his mouth, arranging several manalal ores, minerals that could be mined at the mine, on my desk.

At this time, ownership of the mine belongs to the Koldenze family. From the point of view of the lord, it seems that there is no ownership of the commoners, but for the time being, no one can complain because it has been requisitioned under cause of war responsibility. Rather, only Rumon fathers were very disliked in Nambonan City, so there are many opinions that it is a blur. The source of information is the hated son, Rumon.

Rumon will develop various materials and explain the method for purifying manalal crystals from manalal ore.

“I see. Is crystallization of manalal ore a technology of the Mamshred Federation?”

I took out the manalal crystals that were previously requisitioned from Rumon. This is a mysterious crystal that has the property of storing magical power.

One of the three is scrapped, one is lent to Rupetta, and the other is here.

“Yes. In Nambonan, we have been aware of the culture of Mamshred from early on, and have made and maintained connections. Mamshred is often perceived as a barbarian, but in reality, it is not. Whether it’s ceramics or silk, it wasn’t something that happened by accident, it was created based on advanced knowledge and technology. “

The three major nations of the Eruo continent are the Kingdom of Levios, the Empire of Zinkaen, and the Federation of Mamshred.

The Kingdom of Levios and the Empire of Zinkaen, located in the east and west of the continent, are very similar. Almost all of the inhabitants are humans, and those with magical powers reign as aristocrats, rule the territory and persecute the Xess Holy Society.

The Mamshred Federation, located in the southern part of the continent, is quite different. Almost all of the inhabitants of the Mamshred Federation are of a race called Ajuto (TLN: アジュート).

Strictly speaking, humans are different from Homo sapiens, just because they look similar to humans on the previous Earth. However, since it is recognized as a normal race in my brain, I describe it as a human race when writing a diary.

“I’ve heard that Ajuto uses a mysterious power, but I do not really believe it.”

One of the civilians who was listening to the story of Rumon caught his mouth from the side.

“No, they are a non-magical race. They are no different from a commoner like me.”

“But there are humans like dogs and humans like cats? Then it would be okay to have the power of a beast?”

“It’s misleading because part of the body has the characteristics of a beast, but that’s not the case. Previously, the city of Nambonan had an Ajuto with dog-like ears and a tail. It didn’t have a good sense of smell. I was good at training, but it was within the bounds of common sense. “

Ajuto, the people of the Mamshred Federation. It’s a race of beasts and humans.

I haven’t actually seen it just by reading it in the material, but it seems that ordinary humans have tails and big ears like cat ears.

“Is there a hero in Mamshred? Isn’t that a magical person?”

Another civilian caught his mouth and Rumon moved his gaze there.

All I know about the Mamshred Federation is at best the materials in the castle warehouse and the books I bought in the city.

According to the book, it is very rare for Ajuto, who lives in the Federation of Mamshred, to have a child with extraordinary power.

They are called “heroes” because they have the strength and strong vitality that exceeds common sense, and have the ability to kill people more easily than mowing grass on the battlefield. Somehow it is reminiscent of a human with magical power.

“I don’t know the existence of a hero, but it seems that it is not inherited by a child. In that respect, I think that it is different from a human with magical power. The dynasty of the Mamshred Federation changes often. Is it because the mediocre great king who has no power is destroyed by the “hero” born from the commoners. If he has magical power, this will not happen and the dynasty will last for a long time. “

The history of the Mamshred Federation is the same every time, as if it had been stamped.

First, a child with the power of a hero is born.

When the child grows up, he will use force to overthrow what was the king at that time.

Because the power of the individual is extraordinary, he can reign as an absolute ruler in a new dynasty. Then, draw their tribe to the ruler’s side and give preferential treatment.

In this way, one dynasty is completed.

I think this is a happy ending, but the power of the heroes is not inherited by the child. Then, what happens is that the one who has the same power as the commoner becomes the second king.

In the history of the earth, even an incompetent king reigns without problems, but it is difficult on the continent of Eruo. A ruler who is no different from a commoner is seen lightly. Because it is easy to see the direct power, the commoners dismiss it as the invisible power of authority.

In this way, an unstable dynasty continues, relying only on the majesty of the first hero.

However, one day a child with the power of a hero is suddenly born as if he had been chosen by the times.

It’s still good if it belongs to a tribe or race on the dynasty side, but most of the time it is born in another race.

Naturally, the tribe and race are in a position of being treated coldly, so a child with the power of a hero will lead the tribe and stand up.

The hero who defeated the powerless dynasty becomes a king, and the same history is repeated. The only difference is whether the cycle is long or short.

By the way, the Mamshred Federation is a name like that by the Kingdom of Levios and the Empire of Zinkaen read without permission.

“A dynasty located in the Mamshred region, which united many tribes,” is read as the Mamshred Federation for convenience.

Each dynasty has its own name, but it would be annoying to call it a dynasty.

Currently, the country’s name is Nagi, but few people know it.

The current Mamshred dynasty, the Nagi dynasty, has been in control for a relatively long time.

That is because thorough hunting for heroes has been successful.

No matter how brave it is, it can be easily killed by hitting a large army of infants.

The Nagi dynasty has invested a large amount of national budget to monitor the birth of babies throughout the country.

Those who have been treated coldly by the dynasty live in the hope that someday a brave man will be born in their tribe.

It is said that the beginning of the civil war in the Mamshred Federation decades ago was a child born with the power of a brave man. Having acquired the long-sought hero, the tribe immediately rebelled when its existence was known to the Nagi dynasty.

It is said that it was a 5-year-old boy at that time who dealt with the entire army of the Nagi dynasty.

As a result, the boy with the power of the tribe and the hero was defeated and killed, but the entire Nagi dynasty was so exhausted that it was greatly disturbed.

If the boy had grown a little more, the Nagi dynasty would have been overthrown and another dynasty would have been born.

“The power of the heroes may be similar to the blessing of the spirits around here, except that the power cannot be passed on to the child.”

Spirit blessing is like a magical version of “heroes”.

An ancestor with great magical power can only be born by multiplying the ancestor and the ancestor. I think this will only reduce the number of ancestors, but that is not the case.

Commoners without magical powers, slaves and children of slaves may have humans who belong to the ancestors like mutations.

The ancestor, born between slaves, is said to have been born with the blessing of spirits.

Whether it’s a lie or sincerity, the Xess founder, Mr. Xess, was the blessing of the spirits, a special ancestor born with great blessing, according to the pure scriptures.

Very few children are born with the blessing of spirits. But it’s not a fairy tale or a legend, it actually exists.

The most familiar example is Viscount Galiana. Since he is a commoner, his parents are slaves.

No matter how rich and influential a person may be, a man who is a slave and does not have the fighting power cannot become an aristocrat. It is indispensable that the aristocrat is the ancestor, and it is a condition that cannot be excluded.

Viscount Galiana seems to have had many commoner women when she was young, but all the children born are ancestors. Therefore, he adopted the child of his ancestor who was in the Galiana family when he entered the aristocratic family. This is because the children of the ancestors cannot become aristocrats.

Viscount Galiana seems to have been born in the western part of the continent of Eruo, which was fortunate. The western part of the continent at that time was rough and could not afford the lord-led hunting of ancestors.

Similar to the hero hunting of the Mamshred Federation, the lords of the Kingdom of Levios and the Zinkaen Empire carry out regular hunting of their ancestors. The magical power of the ancestor can threaten the life of the aristocrat, so it is essential for defense.

The aristocratic side can win with a margin because the ancestor who was born in the aristocratic house and trained his magical power from an early age and the ancestor who was born in the commoner’s house and did nothing, have the same qualities but different growth. Is it like a tiger and a leopard fighting?

In the case of the hunting of the ancestors of the Koldenze territory, if the boy is caught, it will be executed immediately, and if it is a girl, it will be protected. This is because the ancestral woman has many uses.

In addition, if she tries to ‘resist’, a slave crest will be engraved on top of the magic seal, and the bad end is waiting for you to be made a machine to give birth at the same time as menstruation begins.

The civilians were so confused that Rumon explained the technology of the Mamshred Federation.

“… But surprisingly, Ajuto has that much culture …”

Perhaps the Rumon behavior so far was good, it seemed that the content of the story could not be cut off if it was a lie.

There, I was taken out of the mosquito net before I knew it, and I caught my mouth.

“What, if you think about it, it might be natural.”

“Young master? … What did you say?”

“Because it is a land without magical power, the commoners have become stronger.”

The Mamshred region is located in the southern part of the continent and is a warm land. Then, if it is a rich land, that is not the case. This is because there are fields on the continent of Eruo.

There is probably a field in the Mamshred region as well. However, in the Mamshred Federation, which has no magical power, there is almost no means to counter mature demon beasts.

The hero is at the level of whether or not one person will be born every 50 or 100 years. There are not enough people to get rid of the demon beast.

Therefore, once a mature demon beast occurs, there is no way to do it anymore. There is no choice but to hold your finger and look at the disasters that pollute the soil, spread disease, and rot the groundwater.

Due to such circumstances, it is said that a considerable amount of land is polluted in the Mamshred region.

How to use the land contaminated by mature monsters, how to prevent the outbreak, and how to efficiently defeat the monsters in the field. It is natural to gather knowledge, improve technology, and advance science to reduce disasters caused by demons as much as possible.

In the Kingdom of Levios and the Empire of Zinkaen, demon beasts are defeated by aristocrats and knights.

Of course, there are fears of demons and mechanisms that try to prevent them from occurring. However, I think that the Ajutes of Mamshred are more urgent.

“… That’s why. If you don’t have magical power, you have to rely on knowledge.”

Rumon is good for Ajuto, but that’s a big part of it.

A commoner who does not rely on aristocrats and has no magical power stands up by themself. This has something to do with the history of Nambonan. It’s not that I don’t understand the feeling of wanting to be favored.

After talking about it, I took a look at the unprocessed manalal ore and observed the work of making manalal crystals at a facility some distance away.

While picking up the manalal crystal, I decided to ask Rumon what I had been wondering for a long time.

“By the way, what do commoners do when they get a manalal crystal?”

Manalal crystals have the property of storing magical power, but I don’t think there is any use for commoners who do not have magical power.

“Used for rings and hair accessories”

“Is that all?”

“Yes”

Apparently, it was just a jewel. Certainly, manal crystals that are transparent like crystals and cast rainbow-colored shadows are beautiful.

According to Rumon, the technology was originally developed to give to the Queen of the Great King, the head of state of the Mamshred Federation.

It seems that women love jewelry as well as Ajuto.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 105: Koldenze family crystal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


“It’s transparent and beautiful … oh? The shadows seem to be rainbow-colored.”

“Oh, this is beautiful”

The civilians picked up a manalal crystal placed on the desk as a sample and were impressed by its beauty.

Since they are civilians with no magical power, they do not seem to be aware of the characteristics of manalal crystals.

“Rumon, how many gold coins is this worth?”

The sample is about the size of a small piece used for the mahjong title.

“If this is the case …”

After seeing the manalal crystals in the hands of the civilians, Rumon thought a little and answered the number of gold coins.

It was an astonishing number for a civilian, and they gently laid the sample on their desk with a pale face.

“Well, that much …”

“I thought I’d give it to my wife, but it’s impossible.”

“At this size … the jewels are scary.”

The civilians stepped back from the desk, even though they had just picked it up casually.

I took out my manalal crystal. It is a manalal crystal that was previously requisitioned from Room On. It’s about the size of an AAA battery, so it’s probably worth it.

I glanced at Rumon and glanced at the crystals.

“It’s … a keepsake of my mother, so the soldiers spilled it with gold coins.”

In the case of a family whose property is confiscated by the patriarch’s collective punishment, the soldiers in the field are given the discretion to overlook any property in their wallets. Not many soldiers know the value of manalal crystals, so they likely missed it because it was called a keepsake.

Whatever happened, if I didn’t visit the requisition site, Rumon would have tried to escape with three enormously valuable manalal crystals.

“If you tell a lie, you will be severely punished.”

When I said that, one of the civilians intervened in a hurry.

“Please wait, young master. What Rumon said is true.”

“Really?”

According to a civilian, Rumon made an excuse to take away the manalal crystals when he started working as a city official.

The facts were confirmed immediately, and it was confirmed by the soldiers in charge of requisitioning Rumon’s father, who was in custody.

For the time being, when I was told to “leave his property”, he voluntarily offered it, and I heard that he was acquitted of taking it away.

“Really. Is it a keepsake of your mother?”

“Yes. It was a gift from my father to my mother …”

Rumon’s father is a merchant who mainly deals with mineral resources.

Rumon’s father, who peddled around the continent when he was young, said he had tried several times to invade the Mamshred region.

It hasn’t changed since he started to set up a trading company in Nambonan City, and he seems to have sent a child-rearing person as a spy on a regular basis.

One of the spies has successfully acquired an official from the Federation of Mamshred and stole three manalal crystals. Moreover, he also grasped the fact that manalal crystals are refined by unique technology.

There is no doubt that huge profits can be obtained if the technology can be stolen. If local officials have been able to acquire it, it will be easy to embrace engineers.

Rumon’s father was a working person and left his family completely abandoned, but at that time he came home in the daytime, whether he wanted to share his joy or just want to brag about his achievements. That’s it.

“… And my dad gave my mother two of those three crystals. I’ll be able to make as many as I want …”

The remaining one will be displayed in the mansion. As expected, manalal crystals cannot be placed in a factory where many people come and go.

After that, Rumon’s mother who gave birth to Kohari died as it was due to poor postpartum confinement.

But shortly before her death, Rumon’s mother handed over two manalal crystals to Rumon and the newly born Kohari.

“… It’s an important form of my mother for me, but for Kohari, it was the only thing my mother gave to her …”

I didn’t know that I had such a feeling, and I scraped one of the three manalal crystals for experimentation and used it as a material for arrowheads.

I pretend to be a calm face and ask Rumon while smirking inwardly.

“… Do you know the owner this crystal is?”

Rumon received a manalal crystal from me and immediately affirmed.

“This is the crystal that Kohari received.”

I exhaled a little so that no one would notice. Apparently, the crushed one was Rumon or the one displayed in the mansion.

I felt that one of the three wasn’t his mother’s keepsake, but I stopped putting tsukkomi in it.

“Well … I see, forgive me for this.”

“… I’m thankful for your kindness.”

Rumon thanked him with his knees and hand on the floor. The civilians also took a breather, and this settled the case.

“It’s also beautiful as a jewel …”

I held Kohali’s manalal crystals over the sun and watched the rainbow-colored shadows falling on the floor.

It is a manalal crystal that is nothing more than a jewel for the commoners, but it can also be said to be a strategic resource considering its characteristics related to magical power.

Although limited, knights will be able to use aristocratic magical powers. If operated well, the power of the army will increase dramatically.

Just as the advent of guns drastically changed the pattern of war on Earth, the advent of manalal crystals is likely to advance the war on the continent of Eruo to the next stage.

“I don’t know why my father wanted this place.”

In his father’s original plan, the suppression of the city of Nambonan was a long way off. There are many reasons for the early schedule, but I’ve heard that there are two main reasons.

The first reason is manalal crystals.

It seems that his father had touched manalal crystals when he was young. His dad would have immediately thought of using it as a weapon.

However, at that time, few possessed manalal crystals outside the Mamshred Federation. Manalal crystals were considered a gem for the royal family of Mamshred, so exports to foreign countries were strictly prohibited.

This is common to all successive dynasties. The great kings of the Mamshred region continued to be attracted to the iridescent glow of the times and tribes.

One of the few examples is that it leaked out in the turmoil of the fall of the dynasty.

Since it is a precious jewel, it cannot be used as a tool for war, and his father at that time may have decided that way.

However, the technique of crystallization was transmitted from Mamshred, and manalal crystals can now be refined from manalal ore.

That means that aristocrats without manalal ore are more likely to be at a disadvantage in the future. In the case of the premortal earth, it would be like a country without oil resources.

It seems that crystallization technology has only been transmitted to some cities, but once it has spread, it cannot be returned.

My father must have had a strong sense of crisis about the future of the Koldenze family. There was no mine in the territory of Koldenze that could produce manalal ore.

At that time, he jumped into the information that a merchant in Nambonan City found a manalal vein.

Should we change our plans to conquer the city of Nambonan and seize the mine? What is the reason for winding it up when it is stolen? What should be the control of the city?

Viscount Galiana leaked one piece of information to my father, who was working on a plan amendment. It is information that the city of Nambonan is connected to the enemy.

And my father decided to occupy the city of Nambonan and raised the army.

My father told me to think for myself about another reason why the plan was accelerated. I’m likely to be asked for an answer soon, so I have to think carefully about the answer.

“Mamshred’s technology is interesting. If you’re an immigrant, you’ll want to welcome him in Nambonan or Nyuneri.”

“I think it’s difficult. The current Mamshred Federation seems to be stable, so security near the border will be tight.”

Rumon speaks generously with information about the current dynasty. He would never have said it when he was a merchant, but now he is a city employee full of compassion.

“If you look closely”

“Yes, because trading with Mamshred is a dream for merchants.”

Even today, pure white silk fabrics from Mamshred are treated like the finest products, and ceramics with fine patterns are highly regarded as works of art.

There are many other attractive products, so it’s no wonder that the former merchant’s rumon is detailed.

“Hmm, by the way, how did you trade with Mamshred? You couldn’t go through the territory of Koldenze openly?”

After the control of the surrounding area, the city of Nambonan was virtually neglected due to my father’s plan, but for the time being there was a conflict. As expected, it is not possible to cross the territory of Koldenze.

“Trading doesn’t mean you can trade well. It’s more likely that you’ll fail. It’s dangerous along the way …”

Going to the Mamshred Federation can be a daunting journey.

Since it is located in the southern part of the continent, it may simply be far away, but the threat of nature blocks the way. There are three main routes to enter the Mamshred region, but none of them is straightforward.

Rumon’s route was to cross the second largest lake on the continent.

“It seems that he went down the river through the Empire side, entered the territory of Evenapis (TLN: エヴェナピス, if someone has a better name just tell me at discord or comment) and then went south and crossed the lake.”

Rumon explains the trade route by giving the names of places and towns in the territory of Evenapis.

Since my mother’s parents’ home is in the Evenapis territory, I have seen the map of the territory several times. So I could imagine the route with my head.

“Are you familiar?”

“Yes. Many people have moved from the territory of Evenapis to the city of Nambonan in the last year or two, so I had a lot of opportunities to hear about the land.”

“……Oh really?”

“Yes. Isn’t the Evenapis territory difficult due to the monster disaster? It seems that the migration to Nambonan was attractive to those who have some assets. The migration is refused in the Koldenze territory and the Siruopea (TLN: シルオペア) territory. It is unlikely that you will move to the eastern part of the empire, which will be subject to heavy taxes.

Commoners basically spend their lives in the land where they were born and raised, but they may also move to another land. For example, if you can’t live anymore on that land.

To put it bluntly, the territory of Evenapis was destroyed by a continental monster disaster that destroyed several villages and towns. The lord of the Evenapis family and the subordinate knights have suffered great damage and their power of control has weakened.

The inhabitants of the Evenapis territory, who couldn’t afford it, were worried about the weakened lord and began to flee to another land. Since the headquarters of Evenapis territory is eastward, it seems that it headed for Nambonan city through the west side where security is weak.

Even though it was glared at by the Koldenze family, the city without aristocratic rule would have looked attractive.

“I see”

“The city of Nambonan has also become a territory of Koldenze, and immigrants will no longer come from the territory of Evenapis, because the mayor of Nambonan is master Wilk.”

Commoners are the ones who control taxes and support the aristocrats who are the rulers. If you imitate it indiscriminately, it could be a source of war. If it is between territories that have a friendly relationship, that area will be dealt with firmly.

The Koldenze family and the Evenapis family are very close. From the eastern aristocrats of the kingdom, they are so close that they can be slammed together with “the three central aristocrats, [the stratagem of Koldenze, the martial arts of Evenapis, and the sword of shiruopea] .”

Anyway, the mayor of Nambonan is me. And my mother, Merly (TLN: メルリィ), is from the Evenapis family, so of course I should be careful.

“It doesn’t change if the knights rule the city of Nambonan. They categorically reject the people who abandoned Evenapis.”

The civilian who said that was from the knight family. He is a man who does not have the right to inherit the patriarch because he has no magical power.

A child born in a knight family who does not have magical power, a slave ancestor has a different way of life depending on the man and woman.

In the case of girls, if they look good, they will come to Indentured Castle and work with the goal of being seeded by the head clan. In the case of boys, he aims to become a civilian or military attaché of the Koldenze family by learning.

He was the latter, and he must have been able to study hard and get a job.

A civilian from the knight family raises the reputation of his parents’ home by devoting himself to the Koldenze family in terms of office work. Even a child without magical power is useful for the house.

“Imitate such fatten their own stomach is an unacceptable thing”(TLN: そのような真似をして私服を肥やすなど、許されないことです, if someone has a better word just tell me)

He is also a civilian boy who came from another knight’s house.

Since the lord of the Koldenze family is in front of him, he may be sensitive to stories about the injustice of civilians.

Although unthinkable in my previous life in Japan, small bribes are included in the discretion of the civilian. However, the refugee issue in the Evenapis territory goes far beyond its discretion, so it appeals to innocence so as not to have any doubts.

Normally, the Koldenze family would lend control of the cities and lands in the territory to the knights for indirect control.

However, regarding the city of Nambonan, I, the head clan, govern through a commoner organization called the council. There were several reasons for this.

First of all, there is no convenient knighthood to lend control of the city of Nambonan.

The city of Nambonan is so developed that it is in the top three in the territory of Koldenze. The economy is larger than the city of Evermil, which I stopped by on the way.

The knights who have been loyal to the Koldenze family for nearly 100 years are given control of the city of Evermil. It doesn’t make sense to give the pop-out knights control of the city of Nambonan.

Then I wonder if I should give it to a knight who has been loyal for a long time, but this is also not good because it looks like only that family will be special.

The knights have roots in the land and govern while interacting with the commoners there, so they cannot be easily relocated.

Second, the knights served for only a few days in the Nambonan City Battle. This is not enough to take control of the city.

For example, a knight who is rampaging in an imperial aristocratic territory with his grandfather can only gain control of the war-torn land by raising some of the enemy knight’s heads on the battlefield.

Just by leading the army, you can’t get control of a city full of rich like Nambonan.

As a result, control of the city of Nambonan will float in the air.

For now, I’m at the top of the city of Nambonan, but the knights think that control of the city of Nambonan will someday come to the knights’ side.

The ‘knightly’ knights of the Koldenze army, who are involved in the city administration of Nambonan, are always thinking about when that day will come.

If you have a track record of making significant contributions to the city administration, it will be easy to appeal to you, “Please give control to your knight’s family!”

Even if my parents’ house couldn’t get control, if I gave a judgment about how they worked, I could just quit the army and get a new job as a knight’s civilian who got control. If you think about salary, it’s better to get it.

In any case, it is very important for their life plan to work seriously, take an authorized position, achieve results, and make a good impression on me.

“Young master, we are closely monitoring that area and are careful not to let the commoners of Evenapis settle in. Rest assured.”

Somehow the Evenapis people are treated like cockroaches and pests, but it’s a problem if you don’t look at them so rigorously.

The current owner of the Evenapis family is my mother’s grandfather, a picturesque martial arts grandfather. I don’t want to come to Nyuneri to complain.

“Oh, I’ll ask that too. I don’t want to bother my mother’s parents’ house either.”

That is the end of the story.

I resumed my inspections, this time talking to miners about the site.

The civilian told me that I didn’t have to do that much during the aristocratic inspection, but for me, a former Japanese, the mine was unusual and I enjoyed watching it.

Receive a wooden board and a brush from Rumon to take notes of what he hears.

“By the way, did you enjoy the Brothel?”

“Eh!?”

When I asked him casually, Rumon was more agitated than I expected. The other day, I was giving away a few silver coins as a brothel fee.

“Is this the first time you’ve been to Brothel?”

I remember being told that when I handed over the silver coins.

That’s why I turned my hand to the brothel enthusiast soldiers to take care of Rumon.

Rumon replies though it’s confusing, how he responded to my remarks.

“Well … yes. That … It was very good. Thank you.”

It was a radiant and good smile. It’s not ridiculous, but I can feel that I really think so.

“Women are … I thought they were good …”

“Let’s agree with that”

It seems that Rumon feels like the weight on his shoulders is lifted off because he has a clear picture of the future for his important Kohari.

It seems that he had a hustle at Brothel to his heart’s content.

“Mayor. Thank you for your cooperation.”

I give a light reply to the clever Rumon.

“Why don’t you look for a bride now rather than worrying about unnecessary things? You’re old enough.”

Rumon, who laughed vaguely, replied that a woman with a beautiful heart would be nice.

Did he didn’t think I’ll steal his girlfriend with my handsome face?

Unfortunately, I can’t deny it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 106 - After the Election
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was after dark when we returned to Nambonan City after our inspection.

The citizens were gathering in the square, lighting fires and drinking alcohol, celebrating on the eve of the election that was to be held tomorrow.

I went back to the mayor's mansion and ordered the civil servants who were cleaning up the documents in the office to finish up their notes before taking a bath. I had been wandering around the mines, and my whole body felt a bit dirty.

The civil servants seemed to have done some work in the carriage on the way back, and by the time I finished bathing and came back, they had finished taking care of the rest of the inspection work.

I had to work overtime today because of the inspection outside the city, but since they were on a fixed salary, they were not paid for overtime. In my previous life in Japan, they might have been described as "company animals" who worked overtime.  I'm sure you'll be able to figure out the best way to make the most of your time here. ...... I'm beginning to feel a bit unhappy for them.

I made Odie prepare some small money and handed it to the civil officer for dinner. There were also stalls in the square, so I would probably eat something delicious.

Shortly after returning from the office to the Mayor's Office, Odie came with tea and a bundle of letters.

There is a letter for you from New Nellie. My horse will be back tomorrow morning, so please let me know if you wish to respond.

Odie put the letter on the desk, and handed me a separate letter sealed with wax. Looking at the symbol on the wax, it seemed to be a letter from my father.

"There's another letter I want to send you. I'll write it tonight."

"Very well, sir."

If he said so, Odie would come to check on him before the horses left.

I wanted to contact New Nelly because I had something I wanted to order. It would be convenient.

I glanced over at Odie, thinking that I should read the letter from my father first. Since it was addressed to me, it might contain some military secrets.

Then I noticed that Odie looked different from usual.

Her expression was still sharp, but there was a sense of joy and peace inside.

As I assessed the change in Odie, she began to confirm her other plans.

"I've made arrangements to go to my grandfather the day after tomorrow as planned. Are there any changes?"

"Nothing in particular. You may proceed accordingly."

My grandfather was currently hard at work building a castle in the westernmost part of the Quadrant.

I'm going to go visit my grandfather this time after my inspection. At the same time, I'm going to give him a souvenir that Fanny gave me.

After a quick chat about my departure plans, I decided to ask Odie why she was in a good mood.

"You look very happy. Did something happen to you?"

"What?"

"You look more cheerful than you did this morning. Did something good happen to you?"

Odie put her hand gently against her cheek as if to check her expression and smiled softly.

"Yes. One of the letters that arrived was addressed to me by your master."

As I craned my neck to find out what my father had sent Odie, she got down on her knees and placed her fingers on the floor.

I was a little surprised by her sudden kneeling, but I waited in silence for her to continue.

"I'm giving you a child for adoption, that's what the letter said."

Odie went into detail about what the letter stated.

I left everything up to my father as to what to do with the eight magical babies Lupetta had protected in the field.

There are a lot of magical babies out there, and the Knight family would love to have them. It simply leads to the stability of the family, and in some cases, it can be used to breed with the family.

It's a matter of communication between the Quardenze family and the knight family, so it's not something that I, the non-head of the family, can handle.

I don't know how my father decided where to distribute the babies, but as a result, Odie was apparently given one of the eight babies as an adopted child.

"If you hadn't taken care of the baby, none of this would have happened. I thank you from the bottom of my heart."

Odie bowed her head deeply, showing her gratitude to me. The tone of her voice was full of relief, and I could tell that she was truly pleased with the decision.

"Mm."

I knew that Odie was married, but she had never taken a leave of absence due to pregnancy. In a way, you could say that people get married to have children. In this continent where there is no such thing as a pension system, children are an insurance policy for the future.

"I will take good care of them so that I can repay the debt of gratitude of the Quardenze family."

Odie bowed reverently and left the room.

I was left alone in the room, sipping a cup of hot tea and thinking about her.

Playing with the letter from my father with my fingertips, I got up from my chair.

"Young Master?"

As I stepped out of the mayor's office, my gaze met with the guards waiting in the corridor.

The guard I was about to call was suddenly found.

"I need to talk to you. Come inside."

"What?"

The guard who silently followed my instructions was Odie's brother.

He gestured to another guard waiting a short distance away to give him some information, then followed me into the mayor's office.

I have some questions about Odie.

"I'll answer as much as I know."

I gestured with my hand to make myself and Odie's brother .

"I know Odie's been married for many years now, but does Odie have any children?

"No... it seems she has difficulty having children."

As I thought, Odie does not have any children.

It seems that Odie's brother has always been worried about his sister's infertility problems, and was relieved to hear when she would be adopting a baby.

"So that's what happened. Yes, I was just a little curious. I was just wondering if Odie was desperate enough to go through the trouble of adopting a child."

From the perspective of my father, who had to think about the stability of the territory, would have given priority to the knightly family, who had no heir, to distribute the babies.

Just as the aristocracy needs the power of the master, the knight family needs the power of the follower. If there was no successor to the ancestor, the knight family would not be able to lend control to the nobles. In other words, the family would've been destroyed.

On that note, I remember that the knightly family that Odie was married into didn't have much trouble with the number of magic users.

"Is that what this is about?"

"Yes. But it makes sense. Also, Odie will be offended, so don't tell her I asked you about this."

"Yes, sir."

After a bit of silence, I let him out of the room.

I began to deal with the bundle of letters with a vague feeling in my heart.

It would be nice to have a rest day once in a while.

I left the letters with Odie, and went to bed empty-handed.

The next day, the city of Nambonan was abuzz with excitement in the morning.

It was the long-awaited election day for the citizens.

The square seemed to be a continuation of last night's party, with various food stalls lined up for fun.

If this were New Nellie City, I would have dressed up as a commoner and explored the city, but alas, this was Nambonan City, and the guards had told us not to do that because it was not equipped with a magic circle for wide-area detection.

Because of the proximity of the imperial aristocracy, the possibility of assassins entering the city is much higher than in New Nellie. No wonder the guards didn't like it.

As I arrived at the highest point of the castle, I decided to watch the citizens at the polling station from afar.

It seemed that the voting system was not like the one in the previous generation in Japan, where you could vote at any time from morning to night. After everyone had voted, the votes were immediately counted on the spot.

The citizens who were not in charge of the election were happily watching the vote counting process while snacking on food bought from the stalls around the polling stations.

When the vote counting was over, the winners from all over the country came to Nambonan Castle.

This is because the castle serves as the council chamber.

There is also a square in front of the council chamber where the new council members are unveiled.

Nambonan Castle is currently used as a meeting place for the new council members and as an anteroom for their unveiling.

As I entered the anteroom, a bright orange hair was the first thing I noticed.

"I see you've been elected."

"Yes!"

As I had expected, Anna had been elected as a member of the council, and since there were other people here, she used formal language with me.

As Anna and I were talking, I noticed the other four elected members glancing at us.

All but Anna were men. I was not happy to see men glancing at me.

Anna introduced me to the other four winners, the future members of the council.

One middle-aged man and three elderly men, all of whom first of all apologized for the fact that they had disobeyed the Quardenze family, and declared that they would make every effort to keep up with the payment of the reparations owed to the city, and that from now on they would live as Nambonan citizens of the Quardenze territory.

"Hmm. Good idea."

My father expects stable control over Nambonan City.

The attitude of the council members was good, as they immediately showed their obedience to me.

As we talked briefly about the election and the future of the city government, one of the three elderly councilors fearfully asked for permission to speak.

I grant it.

"... the council members we appoint, do you have, um, any restrictions?"

There are a total of ten members of the council, five of whom are elected by the citizens, and the other five are nominated directly by the elected members.

The old man was probably wary of being told to nominate someone from the Quardenze family.

"We will not tolerate anyone who opposes the Quardenze family."

"Other than that...?"

"No. That's what elections are for, isn't it?"

There was an inaudible cheer in the room.

The air was filled with a mixture of surprise and excitement that all of the council members would be appointed by the citizens.

I felt bad for the thrilled council members, but at worst, the mayor could overrule everything with his authority. There is no need to go to the trouble of arranging for a breathless councilor.

Rather, it is the administration that is important. Politics is not only about the council, but also about the officials who actually work there.

However, the city hall is staffed with a number of civilian officials seconded from the military in Quardenze. If they try to cheat on taxes or plot a rebellion, they will be exposed.

I'm the mayor of Nambonan, but I'm going to leave the details of city administration to the council and city hall.

Nambonan City is recognized as a major transit point for trade between the Kingdoms and Empires.

Now that it has a powerful ally in the Quardenze territory, its position will be solidified. If it can be established as a transit city for trade, I believe it will become a vibrant city full of more people, money, goods, and information than ever before.

I believe that the energy of Nambonan City comes from its citizens, who have a spirit of independence and self-reliance, and who are conscious of the need to improve their city as much as possible.

Therefore, all I have to do is to scoop up the top of the profits as taxes.

At the very least, I'll keep an eye out to make sure the independence movement doesn't start.

"Who is Anna going to nominate for the council?"

I've asked a merchant I know.

He's a regular customer at the tavern where Anna works, and he came forward to help her this time as a councilor.

When I heard the name of the merchant, Rumon, who was standing next to me, nodded with a predictable look on his face.

When I asked him the name of the merchant, Rumon, who was standing next to me, nodded with a predictable look on his face.

"If I was to be elected, I was advised to nominate someone young.

It seems the people who come to the tavern have advised him that the Nambonan needs ideas from the younger generation.

One of the characteristics of the business associations in Nambonan City is that many of them have a short history. This is because many of them took advantage of the difficult times that the city was going through.

It is not uncommon to find that some of the city's most influential merchants were mere peddlers a decade ago. Many of them stopped by Anna's tavern when they were just starting out. As a result, many of the business owners in Nambonan City are said to be Anna's fans.

Anna's connections are stronger than he imagined.

"He was very much in love with you, Anna. He was so in love with you that he would be happy to be nominated. He's a very talented man and his family is very powerful, so I think we can expect him to be a good senator."

The merchant nominated by Anna was in his early thirties and the son of the heir to a large merchant family.

But Anna had always been courted by men in the tavern, so she was used to turning them down.

"I see."

I felt a surge of possessiveness in my heart.

The sexual desire that I had built up last night was now beginning to run rampant.

I wondered if there was a bed in Nambonan Castle. That's all I could think about.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 107 - I'll Eat The Tavern Girl in the Council Meeting Room (1/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The announcement of the election results and the unveiling of the winners would be held in the evening, so we would have to wait at Nambonan Castle for a while.

I asked Rumon to get something for me and continued chatting with the five council members.

Except for Anna, the other four were paying excessive attention to my every move to avoid being rude to me, but as we continued chatting, they began to relax a little.

I was quite impressed with their efforts to communicate as a representative of the people, even while they was in awe of the nobility.

After we had taken a break from chatting, I approached Anna.

I casually put my hand on her buttocks and asked her to go to the other room.

"Another room?"

"Yes. I have something to do."

Grabbing Anna's thin wrist, I left the waiting room and went into the next room.

This room was the meeting room of the council, the heart of Nambonan City. It was like the main chamber of the House of Representatives in my previous life in Japan.

No one is using it now, but normally the council members would gather here to make important decisions for the city government. Apparently, citizens are allowed to visit. It was in this room that the peace conference was held.

The stone walls were cool and heavy, and the room was filled with silence. I couldn't hear the voices of the four senators who were supposed to be in the next room.

"Um?"

I gave a blunt answer to Anna, who had a curious expression on her face.

"I'm starting to feel sick."

"What...?"

Without waiting for her understanding to catch up, I pressed my body against hers and took her lips as hard as I could.

"Mmm."

"Anna...mmm....!"

I pushed Anna down on a nearby desk and leaned over her on her back and kissed her passionately.

Anna struggles to resist, shaking her body with a thud, but gradually calms down as she wraps her tongue.

I pressed my swollen crotch against her body, enjoying the feel of her flesh, and continued to suck on her saliva with all my might.

"...pfft! What happened to you all of a sudden? You startled me."

"I wanted to do it. You know that, right?"

Then I took Anna's hand and made her touch my crotch, which had become a tent.

"Well... I'll be going to your room tonight then."

She was not in the mood for sex, as she was about to be unveiled to the public.

Anna seemed to be pondering how to reject it.

But I was already in the mood.

I unbuttoned the button on my pants, and the meat stick came out with a bang.

Anna's expression clouded slightly as she saw the sharp rise of my penis, as if I had torn the fabric.

I put my hand on the base and silently made my request to Anna.

She slowly gets off the desk and squats down in front of me.

"... chu."

With a look of helplessness, Anna kissed the tip of the stick.

Without letting go of her lips, she suddenly took a full mouthful of my cock.

Her sticky tongue licked my glans at high speed.

"Mmm!　Mmmph!　Chu...... chup, chu...... chu, mmm!　Mmm!"

"That's good, Anna. Ahh, ..."

Anna's tongue is even more skillful than usual, bringing a pleasant stimulation, as if she is trying to quickly appease me as fast as possible.

The sight of her breathing hard and moving her head back and forth, using the blowjob technique I had taught her, was irresistible.

"Juu, juuryu, juu... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Juu... Jubu--"

The sound of Anna's giving me a blowjob echoed well in the quiet meeting room.

I'm sure Anna just wants to get me to ejaculate as quickly as possible so that she could leave, but the way she devours my penis with single-minded devotion excites me like a lascivious woman.

I never get tired of seeing this scene, and my sense of sexuality immediately peaked.

"Anna, drink it all...!"

"Mmmmm! Mmm! I'm not sure what to do. Aah!

I held the back of Anna's head as I climaxed, and released my semen as hard as I could into the back of her throat.

"Oh, Anna, ......!　I'm cumming...!

"Unh!　Mmmm!　Mmmm ......!"

The semen that stayed in the mouth without being swallowed envelops my meat stick and drowned it in the indescribable warmth.

"Drink it all, Anna.

"Drink it all, Anna."

"Mmm..., mmm."

When I had intercourse with Anna, the blowjob was at best a kind of foreplay to accentuate the excitement, and then I would usually release my semen into her vagina.

I stroked Anna's head as she choked and swallowed my semen little by little, confused by the unaccustomed oral ejaculation.

She made a slow pistoning motion with her head to help my cock continue its slow ejaculation on her tongue.

"That's good, now savor it."

"Mmm..."

Her tongue crawled over my sensitive glans, which felt slightly uncomfortable as the tongue tried to wipe away the semen, but the sensation was more than worth it.

I wanted to praise Anna for being able to do the rest of the work without me having to say anything after my oral ejaculation.

"chu...... phew......"

She made one last gulping motion and then removed her mouth from my cock.

She squatted down, looked up and said in a slightly accusing tone.

"What's wrong with you today? This is so sudden..."

"I heard that another man was making moves on you."

She fixed her slightly disheveled outfit, squirming in her mouth as if her semen was stuck in her throat.

When I saw her beautiful body again, my penis, which had just ejaculated, was full of energy again.

"Anna, one more time. I want to do it again."

"But ...... we're all right next door. ...... Besides, this is a meeting room, remember?"

"No. I want to fill Anna's vagina with my semen. Is that okay?"

...

"Fine. ...... I'm going to cum in your mouth again, okay?"

Before I could deny her, Anna was sucking on the meat stick again.

"Chu ...... ♡ I'll definitely be in the bedroom tonight, that's all for now, okay?"

It was so cute to see Anna begging with her mouth wide open and her penis on her tongue.

It's like she's a big sister tormenting a boy who is dying to have sex. It's a very moe situation.

"I'm sure you'll like it. Churu~......♡"

In contrast to the violent licking and sucking that she had just done, she began to gently suck and suck the entire penis.

The warmth of her deep affection slowly hardened my penis.

As expected, it is wasteful to discharge two shots into the mouth and supply protein to Anna.

After all, sex is about vaginal ejaculation and making babies.

I pulled my hips and pulled out my penis at the timing of Anna's head piston movement.

"Ah!?"

Threads of saliva could be seen as my cock was exposed.

The moment Anna opened her mouth to put my dick in her mouth again, I turned my waist and prevent her from doing so.

"Rinse your mouth."

I handed her the cup I had brought from the anteroom, which was just water made with magic.

She rinsed out her mouth and wiped her lips with a handkerchief.

"Anna, lie down on the desk over there.

"Yes ......"

She seemed to have decided that there was nothing she could do to stop my desire for sex, so she climbed onto the desk like a frog waiting to be dissected.

I took up a position between her spread legs and pressed a kiss to Anna's upper body.

"You're so cute. Chuu♡"

"Mmm, chu♡."

The slight scent of pussy juice lingered in the air, but I didn't care and dipped my tongue in.

It's frustrating that we're both wearing clothes, so we can't touch each other directly.

Just as I was about to undress her, there was a knock on the door of the conference room.

I could feel Anna tremble slightly as we lay together.

"Mayor, it's Rumon. I've brought you what you asked for."

I hear Rumon's voice from behind the door. I used him as a patsy a while ago, but it seems he has finally returned.

"Come in."

"Oh!"

The only one who came into the room was Rumon who had said "Excuse me". It was only natural, since I had told the guards in advance not to let anyone but Rumon enter.

Rumon saw me pushing Anna down and blinded his eyes.

When the Rumon saw me pushing Anna down, he covered his eyes

"Um, Mayor ......?"

"Leave it here."

I then pointed to the desk right next to the one with Anna on it.

Rumon was puzzled, but he came closer to my designated spot.

Anna, on the other hand, was clinging to me desperately, probably trying not to be seen. But there's only one person with that bright orange hair in this Nambonan castle right now.

Rumon must have realized who it was, too, because he immediately averted his gaze as soon as he put the crate down.

"Ahh...."

Anna blushes as she shivers.

In fact, since she was wearing clothes, the only embarrassing part was the pose she struck while hugging me.

"Excuse me."

Rumon excused himself quickly and left the room.

With Anna still clinging to me, I picked up the wooden box that had been placed there.

Inside was a brand new razor blade that I had just purchased. I was planning to give it to Anna when the election was over, but there's no time like the present.

When I took the razor blade out of the box and held it up to the setting sun shining through the window, the polished blade gleamed beautifully as it sought its prey.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 108 - I'll Eat The Tavern Girl in the Council Meeting Room (2/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Hmph...... It's awful. ......"

"Heh, forgive me."

Apparently, it was very embarrassing for Anna to be seen in an erotic scene in a public place.

Anna blushed and pushed her face against my chest.

"Careful, I have a blade."

"A blade?"

I held the razor blade high in the air so as not to cut Anna.

When she noticed the razor blade, she pointed to it with a surprised look on her face and stared at me in silence.

"You'll take it, won't you?"

Anna gave a small nod and took the razor blade.

"Wow, ...... this is very sharp."

"It's going to cut well, isn't it?"

I bought the best quality one at a knife store in Nambonan. I think I could have gone for a high quality one with all the jewels like an aristocrat, but I decided to focus on practicality.

As I explained about the razor blade, I secretly loosened the belt on her skirt.

Today Anna was in her usual waitress costume.

I advised her to stand in front of the public in her usual outfit, as she was famous as the bar's signature girl.

This was an attire that I was used to removing, so by the time Anna noticed my hand movements, her skirt was almost off. The only thing left on her lower body was her underwear, which looked like a pair of short pants with a bulge in the middle.

"Come."

"Yes ......?"

"I want you to show how you belong to me."

Grasping the razor blade while on the desk, Anna sullenly moved her gaze from side to side.

I smiled at her and widened the angle of her legs.

"I'll do it tonight..."

"No."

I pinched Anna's underwear and slid it down little by little, as if insisting that she not be allowed to escape.

She soon seemed to give up and lifted her hips, removing her underwear.

I guess she didn't expect to be asked to have sex in the council chambers, with her cunt exposed.

Her labia, which were beginning to get moist and wet, gave off a slight feminine scent that stimulated my nose.

"Ugh ...... I'm so embarrassed."

"Give me a good view of your important parts."

I touched my hand to Anna's pubic hair and felt it soft and fluffy.

To make it easier to shave, I filled a cup with water I had made with magic and handed it to Anna.

"Oh, don't look too much..."

Wetting her pubic area with water, Anna applied the razor blade.

The sound of hair and skin scraping echoes in the quiet room, and the frizzy pubic hair fell to the desk.

"Ah... why... in this place...I'm so embarrassed...."

Each time the blade moves back and forth, the visible area of skin increases.

Even though it was a sharp blade, it seemed to hurt a little even if it was wet with water. With a slightly painful face, she continued shaving, each time causing a crisp sound.

"Huh?"

Perhaps it was because she was doing this in a public place, or perhaps it was because she was being watched closely by me, but her labia were twitching as she spread her legs wide open.

She seemed to be aware of this and would try to hide it from my gaze.

Anna continued to move the blade silently, her face as red as the setting sun.

"What do you think, ......?

I look at Anna's pubic mound, which is now completely hairless and smooth.

However, the skin had been damaged a little so blood was beading up in places.

I ran my hands over her entire pubic area, healing her skin with magic. Since she was already fully clothed, there was no hair in the way and I could touch her skin directly.

"Ah!"

It was very sticky and wet. I don't think I would have gotten wet like this if I had just dipped my finger in shaving water.

I put my middle finger inside her vagina, and slid it in. She seemed to be completely ready to accept it.

"Now Anna is mine. ...... chu"

"Chuu♡"

I spread Anna's thighs wide with both hands, bringing her face close to mine.

Her pubic part, which had been stripped of the hair which one protected it, had a very obscene shape, with her clit sticking out nicely.

The thought of these folds of flesh hugging my dick made me leak out a bit of precum.

"Hmmm, is it okay for a member of the council to be like this in the council chamber?""

I whispered in her ear and Anna covered her face with her hand. The fingers in her vagina tightened as if they were about to be crushed.

"Tell me what you want. My dear Anna."

"Oh no. ......"

Shaking her head in disapproval, I pushed her lightly and rolled her over so that she was on her back on the desk.

I crouched down between her M-shaped legs, brought my face close to hers, and ran my tongue over her pubic area, which kept twitching and begging for something.

"Hiya ♡"

"Chu......rero......chururu............"

"Ah!　No, no!　Not that place ♡"

Anna moans in a high-pitched voice as she receives cunnilingus.

It is very easy to lick, partly because the bristly pubic hair has disappeared.

The cunnilingus on her bare pussy seemed to excite Anna more than when she had pubic hair.

Anna continued to scream in pleasure, saying she was embarrassed and ashamed.

I began to work on her clitoris area and pulled down her pants to prepare for penetration.

"Huh ...... ku ♡ aah ♡ good ♡ mmm ......"

When I stick my tongue into the vaginal hole, her vagina, mistaking it for a penis, tightens, wanting me to give it semen.

I felt the pressure on my tongue and decided to move on to the final act.

I stood up quickly and kissed Anna, who had spread her legs and had a pensive expression on her face.

"I'm going to fill her up with me. Anna is mine now. Okay?"

"I'm already the mayor's ♡..."

The tone of her voice was very cute and tickled the male's heart.

With my meat stick at her vulva, I smile at Anna.

"Well said. As long as you remember those words, I will protect you until the day I die."

As soon as I finished saying that, I thrusted my hips deep and joined Anna.

"Aah!"

Her body gasped with pleasure at the long-awaited insertion of the meat stick.

Her vaginal walls began to contract as they wrapped my dick in search for semen.

"Hgh ...... ah, that's good ......"

The legs of the desk rattled from the piston movement, but I didn't care, I kept moving my hips.

Anna seemed to be intoxicated by the pleasure coming from her lower body.

"Anna, Anna!"

"Aaah!　Deep ♡ Hahaha ...... ah!　Oh, more!"

As if I was marking her body, I pumped harder and deeper.

The only sound in the silent room was the sound of Anna and I fucking, and it seeped through the stone walls.

I felt as if only the mating man and woman were clearly visible in the room.

"Fuck!　Oh, crap, I'm ...... going to ...... it out!　I'm cumming Anna......!"

I told her about my rapidly rising ejaculation and announced that I was going to put my seed in her.

"I'm going to give you a lot of baby stuff, all of it."

Anna's legs were wrapped around my hips.

My cock feels the essence of intercourse and swells and hardens at once as I try not to let the semen escape.

"Take it!　Anna!"

"Aaahhhh ♡!"

I collapsed against Anna's body, unleashing my seed with a buzz sound.

The pleasure of my ejaculation and the relief of being surrounded by the softness of her flesh caused my saliva to flow unconsciously.

My penis continued to send out semen in a desperate attempt to make Anna cum.

"Ah ♡ Ah ♡ Wow ...... so much ...... is coming out ......♡"

With our bodies overlapping, Anna seemed to be feeling my semen strongly.

With the way she held my waist with not only her legs but also her arms, she looked like a woman ready to mate.

I surrendered to my feelings and pressed kisses again and again on her neck, her breasts, and her lips.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 109 - Councilor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I planted a generous amount of semen in Anna's vagina and fixed her messy clothes.

The white semen that dripped in streaks from her vaginal opening, exposed by her spread legs, was indescribably erotic.

"So much...."

Anna wiped the semen off with a cloth and put on the underwear that had been thrown away in an attempt to fix her messy clothes.

There are a number of red hickeys on her neck and collarbone that look like bug bites, but Anna doesn't seem to notice.

I put my hand on Anna's waist as she continued to worry about the smell of semen, and I left the meeting room.

"Mayor..."

In addition to the four council members, there were five more men waiting in the waiting room.

I guessed they were the five appointed council members who had been nominated by the elected council members.

All nine of them greeted Anna and me with vague smiles on their faces.

The look on their faces from the moment we entered the room meant that Anna's moans might have reached this room.

"Mayor, that ......

"Ah...."

The young man who stepped forward was a man dressed in high quality clothes for a wealthy man. He looked to be in his early thirties.

Judging from Anna's small voice, I guessed that he was probably the senator she had appointed.

"What is it?"

The man introduced himself with a merchant-like movement and said that he was a councilor appointed by Anna.

He glanced over at Anna and made a perturbed face.

Anna's afterglow sexiness was so teasing that I almost had a second erection next to her.

He seemed to have his sights set on Anna, so I pulled my hands around her waist and pulled her close to me.

Anna looked embarrassed, but she didn't reject me and stuck to me.

"Anna....?"

From the look on Anna's face, he could tell that she had consented, not been forced into submission.

The other members of the council seemed to know what was going on when they saw her snuggling up to me with a meltingly sweet expression on her face, her hickey-covered neck exposed, and the stench of cum that came from her.

"This ...... is a cause for celebration!"

"Yes, that's right. As expected of the mayor.

The councilors behind her opened their mouths one after another as if to shake off the muffled air in the waiting room.

The councilor who had been nominated by Anna in front of him was still staring at Anna in a daze.

"Anna tells me you're quite good. I want you to work hard for the development of Nambonan City."

"Y-.. yes....."

After answering me, he stepped back, wobbling slightly like a drunk.

As I was somewhat watching him, Rumon came up to him and gave him a pat on the shoulder. They share the common trait of being the sons of a large merchant family, so perhaps they are close friends.

There is a plaza in front of Nambonan Castle, where the council is located, and it is usually the place where major announcements about city affairs are made.

This is also where the announcement of the surrender to the citizens took place. The results of the elections are also announced here, and the birth of new council members is announced to the citizens.

Anna and the nine male members of the council went up on the stage and announced their appointment to the crowd of citizens gathered in the square.

After the announcement of my arrival, it was time for speeches by the council members.

The elected councilors paired up with their chosen appointees and stood at the front of the stage to introduce themselves and talk about their vision for the future of the city government.

"You seem to have a very good grasp of the situation."

"Yes, I do."

The civilian officer of the Quardenze army nodded his head in reassurance as he took notes on what the councilors were saying.

As if in unison, the councilors began their talk with a slogan like, "I am now a councilor of Nambonan City in the territory of Quardenze. It was as if they were reminding the citizens that Nambonan was no longer an independent force.

The words that followed showed the characteristics of each councilor, but basically, the content was the same.

The elected officials pledged to be sincere to the citizens, while the appointed officials talked about the future management of the city.

One of the civil servants reacted to a councilor who said that the city should become the second largest city after New Nellie. His family is a knightly family that controls the second largest city in the Quadrant. Maybe he didn't want to lose.

"Anna is next."

"Yes. After all, only the spirit of Nambonan is worthy of going last."

It was Rumon who said so.

The spirit of Nambonan is a great alias, but I immediately understood that she was popular enough to deserve it.

As Anna and the nominated senator advanced to the front of the stage, a loud cheer that could only be described as a roar echoed through the square.

"You're very popular."

Anna's vagina, who was attracting the attention of all the citizens in the square, is still filled with my semen.

The citizens would never have dreamed that the little nymph in front of them was having sexual intercourse with the mayor just a few moments ago.

According to Rumon, because of the age difference between us, Anna and I look like mother and son, so the idea of a physical relationship would not be first thing that comes to mind. If the sexes were reversed, such a thing would not be uncommon, he said.

The poor appointed councilor, who was caught completely off guard and had Anna snatched away from him, declared that he was ready to become a city councilor with Nambonan City.

The person I really wanted to be with is now mine.

I hope that he will devote his energy to the development of Nambonan City and increase the tax revenue to the Quardenze family.

After all the council members had finished their talk time, it was finally my turn to speak.

When the city official announced the mayor's entrance, a frenzy that rivaled Anna's earlier appearance filled the square.

Shaking the fabric of my clothes from the explosive sound, I hurriedly came out from the side of the stage, climbed up to the stage, and waited in silence.

After a few moments of silence, the voices died down and the entire square became eerily silent. Finally, I opened my mouth.

"Citizens of Nambonan."

Using the magic to raise my voice, I began my speech as if I were speaking quietly.

I had put a lot of effort into memorizing the manuscript and practicing my speech, so I was able to speak smoothly and without hesitation.

I told the audience that the election in Nambonan had been very interesting, that I was relieved to see that the elected councilors were loyal to the Quardenze family, that I expected Nambonan to continue to grow, and that I would continue to watch over the city as mayor. In summary, that's what I said.

"After listening to the declarations of the ...... councilors, I have determined that there is little chance of treason on the part of the citizens of Nambonan."

The citizens must have been relieved, too, because a sigh of relief overlapped with a deep, soothing bass, "Oh."

In fact, based on the data compiled by the civilian officials of the Quardenze army and the inspection of the city, we judged that the possibility of a rebellion was low.

And I decided to tell them what the citizens must be concerned about on a daily basis.

"I authorize the city to build a new wall."

This seemed to be a big surprise, and the citizens, who had been listening to me in silence, suddenly became excited.

After the war, all the walls surrounding Nambonan City were destroyed.

They were dismantled at the request of my father, who wanted the magic-repelling stones that had been used to build the walls. The recovered stones were directly used to build my grandfather's castle.

Obtaining the stone was the only purpose of destroying the castle walls. It would be more correct to say that the walls were lost as a result of the removal of the stones.

That's why Nambonan City now has no city walls, exposing its defenseless state like Anna's pussy. The citizens were worried about this situation, even though troops of the Quardenze army were stationed around the city.

But they cannot insist on rebuilding the city walls. They believe that the Quardenze have destroyed the walls that can be used for siege in order to deter the Nambonan rebellion.

The citizens feared that the Quardenze would use this as an excuse. "You want a wall?　You guys are planning a siege!　You're planning a rebellion!　You're trying to rebel!　I'll kill you all this time! This time, I'm going to kill them all!" They imagined and feared something like this and thus did not protest for a new wall to be built.

Before I left New Nellie city, my father had told me that the rebuilding of the city walls would be left to my discretion. So I decided to give my permission on my own authority.

The citizens, who thought they had gained a great deal of trust from me, were very excited and shouts of joy erupted from everywhere.

After the speech, a party started in the square.

The banquet seemed to have started in other squares in the city, and the population density of the square in front of the council seemed to have decreased slightly.

I sat at a table set up on the platform for the members of the council, drinking tea and listening to the conversation.

"There will be a collapse of the Knights of the Old Voistra in the future, and I have always been concerned about public safety. I am deeply grateful for your trust."

The oldest senator, an old man, expressed his gratitude for the permission to rebuild the city walls.

There are a number of lands around Nambonan that have become part of the Quardenze territory in the last twenty years or so.

The noble families that ruled before that were destroyed by my grandfather, as well as most of the knight families who were subordinate to the families.

It is best to kill the fallen knights as soon as you can, since some of them live as bandits. Thieves with magic powers are a nuisance.

"Voistra. A faded country."

To the southwest of Nambonan City, there was a small country named the Kingdom of Voistra.

Today, that country no longer exists. That's because it was absorbed by the Zinkhaen Empire.

That was more than 50 years ago. When the Voistra royal family saw the momentum of the empire's first emperor, Zinkhaen, in his youth, they decided that it would be better to join forces with him rather than fight against him.

The Voistra royal family approached Emperor Zinkhaen, who wanted to establish his kingdom, and declared that they would return from being the king to being one noble family.

The Voistra family then changed their family name to become one of the noble families of the empire in order to spread the word of the kingdom's demise.

Because of their honest reverence and the fact that they brought the noble families that had followed the Voistra Kingdom together with them to the side of the Empire, they received the dukedom from Emperor Zinkhaen, a position they still hold today.

In this way, the Kingdom of Voistra disappeared from history, but the Empire created a dukedom and a number of count and viscount families that were cronies of the dukedom.

The subjugated groups of the Kingdom of Voistra that switched to the Empire are now collectively referred to as the Old Voistra.

Incidentally, most of the imperial aristocrats that my grandfather dislikes are the former Voistra. Rather, it would be better to say that he hates the old Voistra and also hates the imperial nobles who side with them.

The old senator probably understands that a war to annihilate the old Voistra will start in the near future.

Over drinks, the old senator said that he had been to the Kingdom of Voistra several times in his youth.

"I haven't heard many stories about the kingdom of the Voistra. Can you talk about it?"

"Just an old man's reminiscences, if you don't mind."

"No problem."

"Yes, sir."

I let Rumon, who had completely learned my job as a note-taker, listen to the old stories about the old senator.

The old senator was apparently 80 years old. By commoner standards, that's pretty old.

"When I first went to Ocellaria, the capital of the Kingdom of Voistra, it was so urban that ...... I pissed myself on the spot. In those days, the city of Nambonan was no more than a small village. ......"

So I listened to the story of the Kingdom of Voistra, mixed with the old stories of Nambonan City.

A ruined kingdom that no longer exists. What a phrase that tickled my intellectual curiosity.

Tomorrow we are going to visit my grandfather, who is dreaming annihilating the old Voistra.

I don't know when the war will start, but I'm sure it won't be far in the future.

Chapter 110 - Continental Map 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TL Note: This chapter is basically the author talking about the political geography, and contains 3 maps. Its just lore and is irrelevant to the story, so feel free to skip this chapter. The author talks in first person here.

This time there are 3 maps.

This is the influence of the three major nations on the continent of Eruo.

Blue is the Kingdom of Levios, red is the Jinkaen Empire, and green is the area under the influence of the Mamshred Federation. (Not all of them are actually inhabited and ruled by people.)

The areas not specifically mentioned are other powers and places that are inaccessible to people.

The following is a brief explanation.

Kingdom of Levios

One of the three major nations of the Eruo continent. Founded about 80 years ago.

It was founded by the Levios family, a powerful noble family in the eastern part of the continent at the time, who were upset with the arrogant Holy High Society of Zes, and formed a coalition with the surrounding noble families.

There are no churches of the Holy High Society in the territories of the noble families that participated in the Levios Kingdom from the time of its founding.

It is also a place that claims independence from the priests and respects the independence of the noble families.

The Levios royal family does not have absolute power, but is, so to speak, in the leadership position of the coalition.

It is said to be the most stable country on the current Eruo continent.

Recently, the entire kingdom has been in turmoil due to various reasons, but it seems to be calming down.

Jinkaen Empire

One of the three major nations on the Eruo continent. Founded about 55 years ago.

It was founded by Jinkaen, the third son of a weak aristocratic family in the western part of the continent, during a time of warring factions.

The collapse of the second emperor triggered an upheaval in the succession to the throne that wreaked havoc in the empire.

Mamshred Federation

One of the three major states on the continent of Eruo.

The name of a dynasty located in the Mamshred region that has united numerous tribes, as seen from the perspective of the Kingdom of Levios and the Zinkhaen Empire.

The name of the state changes from dynasty to dynasty, and because the dynasties change so often, the inhabitants of the central part of the continent (where the Kingdom of Levios and the Jinkaen Empire are located) call it the Mamshred Federation because it's too complicated to remember.

The current official name of the country is Nagi.

Some of the tribes came to the Kingdom of Levios as refugees during the civil war that occurred three or four decades ago.

Other forces, etc.

Saint Navenpos

The name is only mentioned in the main story.

I thought I'd written a lot more, but they were actually rejected halfway through and thrown into the trash folder.

What a mess.

Kingdom of Voistra

A small state with the Voistra family as its royal family, which no longer exists.

Its capital is Ocelloria City.

It has been successfully reincarnated as the "Old Voistra," a major faction of the eastern nobility of the Zinkhaen Empire.

Note that the former royal noble families have changed their family names from Voistra.

These are the locations of some of the territories mentioned in the main story.

The blue ones are the Levios Kingdom group, and the red ones are the Jinkaen Empire group.

Here is a brief explanation.

Quardenze Domain

A territory ruled by the Quardenze family with a history of about 300 years.

It has fertile land sandwiched between two large rivers.

In the last 20 years or so, the territory has expanded rapidly through war.

Silopeia Domain

A territory ruled by the Silopeia family.

Princess Plume is here.

Evenapis Territory

A territory ruled by the Evenapis family.

Mother Wilk's birthplace.

Galiana Territory

A territory ruled by the Galliana family.

In the city of the main base, there is a sex slave merchant who has set up store for Wilk.

Levios' Domain

A territory ruled by the Levios royal family.

Milendorva Territory

A territory ruled by the Milendorva family.

Princess Orcian is here.

Jinkaen Empire

There is an enclave.

This is not an editing error.

Old Voistra

The dark pink area to the east is the territory of the former royal family, which is now a duchy.

The light pink area to the west is a collection of noble families that followed the Kingdom of Voistra. They've been made barons, viscounts, and counts of the empire.

Mamshred Region

A land inhabited by a race called Ajuts.

It has a warm climate and many rare plants and animals that cannot be seen in the central part of the continent.

Since there is no one with the power to stand up to mature magical beasts, a great deal of the land has been polluted.

The second largest lake in the continent

This is the second largest lake on the Luo continent.

It is more than just a lake, but the details have yet to be revealed in the main story.

This is an addition to the previous map (Chapter 75).

I thought there would be more, but only the city of Ocellaria has increased.

In addition, cities that are just extras to the story are not listed. （For example, Evermill City.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 111 - Frontline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I prepared a few souvenirs for my grandfather, who was hard at work on his castle, and set out with the army for the westernmost part of the Quadrant.

Departing from Nambonan City, we proceeded westward over uneven terrain for a day and a half, until we came upon the base where the flag of the Quardenze army was displayed.

Looking to the northeast, Mount Erechtheion, the highest peak on the continent, loomed over us, supported by the Keebolf Mountains.

On the other side of the Keebolf Mountains is the northern part of the continent, a land of mist.

It is a barren land where the soil is polluted by the endless birth of mature demonic beasts, and only a few ethnic groups live there.

The central part of the continent is protected from the mature demonic beasts of the north by a natural curtain of mountains and rivers.

"Looks like construction is underway."

It hadn't been long since the construction of the castle had begun, but the walls and fortifications were beginning to be built, albeit in parts.

There were buildings here and there that looked like watchtowers, similar to rook pieces from chess, and I could see that they were packed with soldiers.

The color of the surrounding soil was strangely noticeable, probably because it had been cleared. Since my grandfather has the magical power of a nobleman, and his troops are full of soldiers with magical power,  they were very fast at clearing the ground.

There were people everywhere engaged in civil engineering work, trying to keep up with the speed of the land clearing. Although they didn't have whips, I could see that the soldiers nearby were working them hard.

Most of the workers here were former mercenaries who had been deprived of their freedom after surrendering to the Quardenze allied forces in the Battle of Nambonan.

Although their lives had been spared, they had been forced to work as slaves in the harsh civil engineering work, and they were looking at us with resentful eyes.

I left the troops I had led from Nambonan City with the captain at the base and got out of the carriage.

I shrugged my shoulders in the chilly wind, and Tesh pulled a thick cloak over me.

This time, I was accompanied by Tesh and Odie. They had come all this way to take care of their grandfather as servants.

The soldier who greeted us led us to a wooden structure that looked like a prefab hut and a log cabin divided by two.

The soldier led us to a wooden structure that looked like the sum of a prefab hut and a log cabin, and with the back of his head turned, he began to explain.

"General Galfis is currently out in the surrounding villages. I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait here."

Despite its appearance, the building was spacious inside and seemed to have several rooms.

I was taken to one of the rooms and told to wait here for the soldiers.

"Did he say how long he would be back?"

"...... Sorry, I don't know the details. I only know that he left this morning."

Judging by the outfit of the soldier, he didn't seem to be the kind of person who would normally talk to my grandfather or me. He was more like the captain of a small unit.

Perhaps he was just ordered to show me to this room in case the senior military officer was not there when I arrived.

There was no point in asking him too many questions about this and that, since would make him feel intimidated.

"I see. Well, I guess I'll have to wait a bit. Well, when my father return, let them know I've arrived."

"Yes sir!"

The soldier replied, not bothering to hide his relief, and hurried out of the room.

There was a simple mobile fireplace in the cool room, and firewood was ready nearby.

Immediately, Tesh and Odie began to move quickly to set up the environment in the room.

The fireplace was lit and the room was getting warm when another soldier came into the room.

He was a military officer in my grandfather's unit, and I had talked to him a few times.

"General, you are scheduled to stay overnight in a nearby village. He'll be back around noon tomorrow."

It seemed that he and my grandfather had gotten mixed up.

It was inevitable, since there was no civilized means of communication like the telephone. A letter can only give a rough estimate of arrival.

"Are you on a tour?"

"Yes, sir. We're trying to identify the traitors."

This area is a land that has only recently come under the control of the Quardenze family. Before that, it was ruled by the nobles of the Empire.

As a matter of course, they would kill the enemy nobles and knights, but they would not slaughter all the inhabitants.

The inhabitants of the villages, towns, and cities continue to live with the newly arrived rulers, the Quardenze family and the knightly families associated with them, as their lords.




However, there are those who oppose the rule of the Quardenze family. These are the commoners who had been taking advantage of the lord's side and savoring the spoils.

These people want to continue the vested interests they originally had, or they support guerrilla activities by hiding people from the former lord's side.

That is why it is necessary to make occasional visits to smoke out such people and execute them.

In some cases, tribute is prepared to impress the new lord. I've heard that this is more common than not.

Maybe I could have had all the cute village girls I wanted. When I think about it, I regret that my grandfather and I got mixed up.

"I see. What should I do now?

It was still early in the evening, and it would be unbecoming of a soldier to start sleeping so soon after arriving.

"I'd like to take a look around this base."

"Yes sir! I'll show you around."

The superiors can make their soldiers feel better just by walking around and observing them.

I had Tesh and Odie help me get dressed, so I could look like a soldier.

After I finished my inspection of the base, I had dinner with the soldiers.

If you just put on a big face as an aristocrat and neglect your soldiers, morale will not go up when it comes to battle. For this reason, moderate interaction is essential.

When I offered them a pile of sake barrels that I had dragged all the way from Nambonan City, the soldiers were very pleased. As I expected, it was a lot of work to carry the sake up here, so they didn't seem to be able to drink much.

After dinner, I returned to the building that had been prepared for my stay, and found Tesh and Odie having a meeting.

The two servants were staying in this building because they were going to inspect a military facility.

"What are you doing here?"

"I was having a little meeting about personnel matters after we return to New Nellie Castle."

Tesh walks up to me and takes off my jacket as he says this.

"Will people change?"

Tesh is my first in command, so if he were to talk about personnel matters, it would be about the transfer of my personal servant.

I wondered who was going to be changed, and before Tesh could give me an answer, I gave him one.

"Oh, Odie, is that you? Are you going to be my personal assistant?"

Although Odie often goes on business trips, she won't have any need to go to the capital until around next spring.

I think there is a very good chance that Odie will be my exclusive servant for a while.

"Perhaps, but I'm not sure what to do about Minith."

It was Odie who answered.

The unexpected name must have brought up a confused expression on my face, so she quickly clarified.

"In the letter from the head maid, it was written that Minith might not be able to work. That's why I've been talking with Master Tesh about who to add to our staff after Minith's departure."

The head maid, the big boss of the female servants at New Nellie Castle, is also Odie's mother.

I knew that the bundle of letters that arrived in Nambonan the other day contained a letter from the head maid to Odie, but I thought it was a father-son correspondence. However it seems to have been a business letter.

"I don't understand. Why is Minith unable to work?"

"Apparently, she is always late."

I was about to ask what the delay was, when I realized what Odie meant.

She nodded her head.

I'm sure you can guess.

According to Odie, Minith was apparently being taken notice of by the head maid.

Since the woman I've had the most sex with in New Nellie City is definitely Minith. There is a very good chance that Minith will be the first to conceive.

Every morning when Minith comes to work, she is greeted by the head maid with a smile like, "Good morning, did you get your period? I heard that every morning when Minith comes to work, she is checked for pregnancy by the head maid. It's a bit pitiful.

It's just that she's so young that she might really just be behind on her period."

Minith is a spry sixteen-year-old. Odie told me not to get my hopes up too high, as it was entirely possible that she was just having irregular periods.

"Well. Minith is ......."

If I had to gamble right now on whether she is pregnant or is just having irregular periods, I would definitely bet on pregnancy.

I believe in sperm produced by healthy 12-year-olds.

"Yes. I'd be delighted if it were true. ......"

She smiled at me, and it looked like the smile of a kind sister who is happy to see her little brother grow up.

But was it my imagination, or did I see a shadow in her smile?

"Odie?"

"Yes? What is it?"

At my words, Odie, who had instantly returned to her servant's face, straightened her posture.

"I'd like to talk to Tesh in private. Would you excuse us for a moment?"

"Certainly, sir."

Odie silently steps back without replying, opening and closing the door without a sound and going outside.

I turned to Tesh and said what I had been meaning to ask him.

TL NOTE: The next 3 chapters are R18 scenes, and since I don't have a habit of cucking people I'll be releasing them all at once, so expect a couple days until its release :))

Chapter 112 - I'll Eat My Former Babysitter Sister Servant (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the base was set up on the front lines of the war against the Imperial aristocracy, there were no private baths available.

Even if there were, it wouldn't look good to take a leisurely soak in front of the soldiers.

During the expedition, we basically just wiped ourselves down and that was it.

After some time of discussion with Tesh, Odie came in with a tub of hot water and a cloth.

It was just me and Odie in the room, so I could get completely naked without any hesitation. I secretly told Tesh to keep other people away from this place, so even if I moaned out loud, there would be no problem.

In other words, I was all set.

"Young master. Let me clean you up.

"Please."

I spread my arms and Odie strips me of my clothes with a practiced hand.

She has the same serious expression on her face as always.

"I'll wipe you down."

Then Odie wiped my back with a wet cloth.

I felt an inexplicable tingle as she touched my neck, sides and stomach.

As Odie continued to work silently, I called out to her.

"Odie, you used to wipe me down a lot."

Ever since we left New Nellie, it has been Odie's role to cleanse me.

I don't want to be touched by tissues, that's for sure. I want to be touched by a woman.

"Yes. I was in charge until the young master was five."

One day, when I was five years old, the person in charge of washing me went from Odie to a junior servant.

Since Odie was originally a senior servant, she was not supposed to do anything close to that kind of work unless she wanted to.

When he was a baby, a trusted senior servant would be in charge of childcare in order to avoid various dangers, but as a five-year-old nobleman, this worry would decrease.

This is because a five-year-old nobleman will not be defeated by a grown-up knight unless he is taken by surprise.

For this reason, Odie no longer had to take care of things like bathing me.

Odie, perhaps feeling nostalgic about those days, shared his memories with us as if talking to us.

"When young master was little, he didn't like to be wiped, and it was hard to get him out of his clothes."

Immediately after my reincarnation, I was deeply embarrassed to be taken care of by a girl of middle school age.

Under the guidance of the head maid, Odie carefully peeled off the skin of my cock and washed my body, but I couldn't help but feel embarrassed.

At the time, she was still a young maiden, but when Odie would say things like, "Your penis is so cute," and pinch my pint-sized dick, it was nothing more than shameful play.

After five years, I've gotten used to being washed by Odie and the head maid. But after I had gotten used to it, I was disgusted when I heard that I was going to have to change my bathing servant.

The only girls who wanted to be my new bath maids were young, so I was in trouble.

Not wanting to show my dick to the maidens, I chose an older woman to be in charge of the baths. She was the old lady who quit the other day.

In hindsight, I feel that it was a shame to throw away a great opportunity to show off my dick to young girls.

"You're getting bigger now, aren't you? How's is it?"

"Yes. I am a grown man now."

In Odie's mind, I was still the cute, frightened little boy who was confused about being reincarnated into another world as a child.

Perhaps remembering her child-rearing days, Odie became more talkative than ever and began to talk about the old me.

I could feel the professionalism of her work as her hands continued to work while she talked.

I turned around to face Odie and shook her hand.

"Young master?"

Odie did not wince at my sudden action, but remained immobile, waiting for my next move.

I don't know why I think it's easier to make the next move when someone resists.

"Odie......"

I've just confirmed with Tesh that there is no problem with me messing with Odie.

If you only consider the facts, it would be a pleasure for Odie to be embraced by me as she is married into the Knight family. It would be the best chance for her to have a child with magical powers.

But even so, I don't want to see the sad face of Odie, who has always taken care of me.

If she didn't like me from the start, or if I had never met her before and didn't have any feelings for her, I could just let her hate me.

It was nice to talk to her, but I was wondering how to get her to have sex with me.

The room was filled with silence.

I could feel that she was concerned about my stiffness.

What a bad look. It might have been a better idea better to attack from behind without thinking about the future.

Even so, it is Odie. Just holding my hand and looking at it, I realized everything, and even though I'm married, I immediately try to offer my body.

As a daughter born into a knightly family, I think she has a good sense of intuition in that area.

"Um...... Odie......"

"It's okay, young master. You are in pain, aren't you? Please leave it to me. There is no need to worry."

With a shuffle sound, Odie untied her own clothes.

She took off her thick jacket and unbuttoned the buttons of the dress she wore underneath, revealing her ample breasts through the messy fabric.

As I looked at Odie, who stared at me tenderly without a trace of displeasure, and the symbol of her motherhood, I couldn't help but feel like spoiling her.

"...... Hmm."

"Oh my."

I jumped into Odie's chest and buried my face in it.

I was still in the process of taking off my clothes, so I couldn't touch her breasts, but I could feel their warmth through the fabric.

I wriggled my head and slipped into the gap between her clothes, and I sought out her breasts.

The next thing I know, her hands are easily wrapped around the back of my head and she's hugging me loosely.

My face was pressed against her plump breasts, making it a little difficult to breathe.

I've always known that Odie was skinny, but these are quite large.

I thought of the boob rankings in my brain, but I was certain that she was bigger than Anna.

"Fufu. How nostalgic. Even when you were a little boy, you loved breasts, didn't you?"

As I slid my nose into her cleavage and smelled her, Odie patted me on the head and said, "You know, I've always loved you.

When I was an infant, I rubbed the tits of Odie, who was about thirteen years old at the time and my caretaker, every chance I got.

Whenever there was a time when the other servants were not around, I would make a valiant attempt to pull Odie's clothes off and suck on her breasts.

He was such a wicked baby, full of confidence that he would be forgiven because he was a baby.

"If you are tired, you may indulge me. I won't tell anyone."

She felt a little like she was back in the old days because of the memories of her child rearing days.

Rather than being Odie facing the legitimate son of the Quardenze family as a servant, she felt like Odie taking care of a little boy.

She would not have said such a thing if she was the usual servant working diligently.

But I decided to take her up on her offer.　

"Odie."

She put her hand on the back of my head and squeezed it into my chest.

"Yes. Boobs, right?"

Surrounded by the nostalgic smell of Odie, I was filled with an irresistible sense of happiness.

As I moved my face to shift the cloth around her chest, wanting to touch her skin directly, she unbuttoned it with one hand, exposing half of her breasts.

The plump, rounded, slightly pigmented nipples appear at a distance of a few centimeters before my eyes.

Only one of her breasts was sticking out of her clothes, as if she was suckling a baby.

I sucked on the tip of the nipple, following my instincts.

Biting my lip, I sucked and sucked, hoping that something would come out of it.

"Odie, chu...... chu...... chu......"

"Young master, ......mm......"

As she stroked the hair on the back of my head, I tasted Odie's nipples with enthusiasm.

Her slightly larger nipples were easy to roll around on my tongue.

I took my time with her right breast, which I had sucked on first, and now I sucked on her left breast, which was still wet with saliva, and devoured it with a disgusting watery sound.

He sucked on her left breast, which was still wet with saliva, and devoured her tits with a lustful watery sound.

"Young master, you're not going to get anything out of me sucking like that,......?"

"Hum...Chum...♡"

It's not a question of whether it comes out or not, tits are meant to be sucked.

Odie's slightly annoyed tone amused me, and I opened my mouth even wider to suck on her breast.

"Mmmm, you look like a baby.

I had sucked on Odie's tits even as an infant, when she was about the size of a junior high school girl, and her swollen tits were good to suck on.

Maybe her breasts had grown because I had squeezed and sucked them. When I think about it, it seems as if the seed I sowed has come around and become the harvest season.

Well, in the true sense of the word, the seeds are yet to be sown.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 113 - I'll Eat My Former Babysitter Sister Servant (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I pressed my tongue against her tits like a dog licking, testing the softness of her breast.

I'm tempted to just wrap myself in her breasts, but the position is a little too tight.

I look up at Odie with my face buried in her cleavage.

Then I move my gaze to the bed for a moment, and she immediately has a look of understanding what I'm saying.

I give her a light push and she moved straight to the bed.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, Odie was dressed in the most disgusting way possible, with only her breasts exposed.

I gently stroked her red hair, which was in a braid up, and then sat down next to her.

Maybe it was because Odie was taller than me, but I couldn't help but notice her breasts.

Her breasts were sticky with saliva, which made me want to suck on them even more.

"Odie, more."

"Yes."

Odie replied and patted her aligned thighs.

I lay on my back with my head on it as she led the way. I felt the softness of Odie's legs on the back of my head.

She leaned forward a little, probably to offer me her tits, her erect nipples came up to my face as if to suck on them.

"Chuh."

"Mmm, does it taste good?"

"Chururu...... chu ♡ chu chu chu."

Responding with a sucking sound, I took a comfortable position and sucked on Odie's tits.

I sucked on Odie's tits from a comfortable position, the tits hanging down from gravity like the udders of a cow.

Odie bends down even deeper, and the other breast rides up to my eyes like an iceberg.

I continued to suck on the breast with only the sensation of my mouth to guide me, even though my vision was blocked.

"Young master, does it taste good?"

"Chu ♡ Chu ♡ ...... delicious, chu ♡ Odie, I like it."

"Yes. Thank you very much.

She said, and touched my lower body.

I couldn't see what she was doing to me because my face was crushed by her breasts, making my lower half even more sensitive.

"Oh, dear."

From the sensation, I knew that my meat stick had popped out of my clothes. I could also tell that it was erect.

Odie must have been surprised to see my erect penis.

When he was being washed in the bathroom, he had a slight erection, but only a semi-erection at best. He hadn't shown the strength of a full erection yet.

"...... Really, I'm sorry you had to go through that."

Then something cool enveloped my meat stick.

I wondered what it was, but soon understood that it was Odie's hand touching me.

I was enjoying the lumpy, rolling nipples of Odie's nipples, and I was focusing all my attention on the touched rod.

Perhaps it was the anticipation of what was to come next, but I found myself unconsciously lifting my hips and shaking my cock.

"If you are uncomfortable, please let me know right away."

"Fuu......"

I responded by licking her breast, and Odie's hand, which was touching my meat stick, moved.

It seemed that my stick was still half covered with skin, and Odie used her fingertips to draw a circle around the boundary between the glans and the skin.

"Chhhhhh..."

I silently pleaded with her to hurry up. The hurried movements of her fingers were painful, and my penis must have been dripping with precum.

Odie held the foreskin between her fingers and slowly lowered it.

The skin peeled off in one slick motion, and I could feel the true shape of my penis being revealed.

She must have been watching the beautiful pink tip of my glans, sloppily dripping clear precum, as it rose up in anticipation of copulation.

The thought that she might be watching me closely makes me feel incredibly embarrassed. I was glad that my face was still smashed by her tits.

"It's still not like when I was a baby. ......"

When I was a baby, Odie used to have quite a hard time peeling my cock.

This time, she was surprised to find that it came off easily with just a little touch.

"It's so big ...... young master. You must touch is frequently, right?"

Odie put his hand around the rod of my penis and slowly moved it up and down. It was a hand job.

I was both happy and embarrassed that Odie, who had always adored me, was doing such a nasty thing to me.

I continued to suck on her tits to hide my embarrassment.

"Mmm, hmm, hmm...... oh, it's big again...... young master, it's okay, let it out a lot."

She holds me in her arms and stimulates my penis while I pose like a baby being nursed.

I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.

"It's a good thing I'm not the only one. Young master, there is nothing to be afraid of, just let it all out."

"Gu...... oh, Odie......!"

The moment she gently stroked my cheek, my penis reached its limit.

"It's coming out!　Odie!　I'm coming out!"

Byu! Byubyu! Byu!

Unlike usual, I could feel the semen blasting away into the void where there was nothing to catch it.

The feeling of filling the vagina and the mouth with semen is also pleasant, but ejaculation without feeling anything is good as well.

"Oh my God! It's amazing."

I felt a warm liquid sloshing down on my chest. I didn't want to think about it too much, but it must have been my semen.

"Aah!　What should I do with my young master's chest?"

Odie's voice had taken on a tone of genuine surprise, unlike the relaxed tone she had used a moment ago.

The semen seems to have flowed out in an arc-like orbit by ejaculating when my hips were raised.

I could tell from the momentum that it was a very powerful ejaculation.

"I can't believe ...... this thing flies so far. ...... young master, there was a lot of it. You did a great job, it's wonderful."

I immediately chastised myself for being surprised by the ejaculation, and Odie praised me for spreading so much semen around.

The stroking of my hair by Odie's loving palms, as if I were a child, was so comfortable that I wanted to fall asleep.

I kissed her nipple, which felt wrinkled from too much sucking.

"I'm sure Minith will get pregnant if this is dumped into her every day. ......"

The last words sounded so sad.

I was half-conscious, but when I noticed the slight change in Odie, my brain woke up at once.

It wasn't that I wanted Odie to do sex work for me this time. I wanted to Odie impregnate.

"Oh my, it's big again."

I put my hands on her hips, and my crotch immediately rebooted. It was still semi-erect, but it would get hard soon anyway.

I took my mouth off of Odie's tits and pushed her down onto the bed with a push to her stomach.

"Ah. Young master, ...... that, do you want me to insert it?"

I looked at her as she was pushed down, and she had white juice on the top of her head that I thought was cum.

I let it out with great force, but I didn't think it would fly high enough to get on my head.

She was lying on her back staring at me, and her face looked a little impatient.

I wondered if she was planning to give me a hand job and be done with it.

"I love you, Odie."

I kissed her face slowly.

She had semen on her cheeks as well as on her head, and she smelled like cum. Although it's a part of what you get from sex, it's a bit hard kissing someone with your semen on them.

"Chu ♡"

"Nn...... chu♡"

I kissed her lightly, just lip to lip, and pulled my face away, and Odie began to undress herself.

She easily unbuckled the belt of her long skirt and pulled down her underwear at once.

With her hand on my crotch, she raised herself up and started to undress me.

She had been a maid for a long time, so she was very skilled at undressing me.

Before I knew it, I was completely stripped and the semen on my body was wiped clean.

When I was sure I was ready for intercourse, I turned my head to Odie.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 114 - I'll Eat My Former Babysitter Sister Servant (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the side of the bed, Odie and I were facing each other, completely naked.

She had her arms crossed to cover her breasts, and her hands were on her crotch.

I tried to peek at her several times while she was undressing me, but Odie's cunt guard was very tight.

She must have sensed that I was still waiting for my chance, because she said with an embarrassed look on her face, "I don't know what to do."

"This is ...... please forgive me for hiding it."

"Is that for your husband?"

"Yes. That ...... here is only ...... for my husband."

The hair on her clit is probably shaved off, although it is hidden by the palm of her hand, so you cannot see it.

She is a married woman, and she must have made a decision to show her hair only to her husband.

I don't know if she and her husband get along well or not, but as a woman, she probably doesn't want any man other than her husband to see her cunt.

As long as I can insert myself, I can put up with it not being seen.

"Alright. But is it...... okay?"

I wondered if Odie would be able to insert me without looking at it, but she seemed to have guessed what I was thinking.

"I'm fine. If it's with young master, the husband will be ...... pleased."

To be the handmaiden of a legitimate son of the Quardenze family is a very pleasing thing in the values of a knightly family.

I thought it was only for unmarried daughters who came to serve at New Nellie Castle.

 I'm not sure that there is a husband who is glad to have his wife... I'm afraid of knights' values of sex.

Well, I think it's a good thing because I have Odie without having to worrying about anything. Everything is about positive thinking.

"I hope Odie's husband doesn't blame her. ...... Odie. Do you mind if I spoil you a little tonight?"

After all that sucking and sucking, I was starting to get some action.

"Yes, young master, you are going to be spoiled as well. ...... just as you did earlier."

"Yes......"

Odie fell back on the bed, holding me in her embarrassment.

In the normal position, due to our height difference, my face was between Odie's tits and her cleavage.

Since we were both naked, I could feel the direct contact between our skin.

I lifted my hips a little and put my hand in the gap to touch Odie's private parts.

I wanted to check her cunt while I was at it, but Odie hugged me back and I couldn't see it.

"Mmm."

Surprisingly, Odie's pubic area was already quite wet. I think I can insert it now.

She seemed to have been shaved, but the hair was still growing in, and it felt like stubble.

I quickly adjusted my position to insert my manhood, but I couldn't quite locate it because Odie was hiding it.

　

It slipped out and I failed to insert it.

"What?　That's weird. ......"

After about three failed attempts, she smiled and opened her mouth.

"Leave it to me, young master."

I was held close to Odie's skin again, my face pinned in the valley of her tits.

"Excuse me."

"Oh. ......"

With the back of my head pinned down and trapped in the cleavage, I decided to follow her lead as she held me close to her body.

Her hand grabbed my already hardened rod and gently moved it up and down, left and right, as if she were fiddling with a round controller attached to a video arcade cabinet.

She checked the position of my stick and gently guided it to her honey pot.

"Keep going, young master,......, and slowly lower your hips."

"Like this ......?"

"Yes. Slowly, please. ......"

As if I were a boy being given a tutorial by an older sister, I inserted my meat stick into her.

As my penis rubbed against the tight vaginal walls, I felt a sweet stimulation in my brain that made my saliva drip.

"Oh ...... Odie ♡."

".....Yes. It's okay. The young master is coming in. ...... Huh ......"

I stretch my neck a little and kiss Odie.

I stick my tongue out and she welcomes mine into her mouth with no resistance.

"Chu ♡"

"Chu, ...... young master, you're a good kisser."

In order to get as close to her as possible, I lower my hips further and continue to insert myself.

It's a great way to get to know a person better.

"Odie ...... Oh, it's all the way in ......?"

From the sensation in my hips, I felt as if all of my meat stick was inside Odie.

When I stopped moving, her hot vagina clung to me as if she was inspecting my cock.

"Yes. You've done a great job ♡."

I sucked on Odie's nipple again, which had turned a little red from too much sucking, and the supreme sexual pleasure from my lips and penis turned my brain pink, very pink.

As I slowly move my penis back and forth, enjoying the feel of her, she lets out a lusty cry.

"Ahh, hmm, ...... ah ♡"

"Odie, I like it."

"Mhm, mhm, young master, ......"

The moment I said I loved her, I felt a small shiver run through Odie's body and her vagina tighten.

I moved my hips again, stretching my neck and trying to get closer to Odie's ear.

"Odie, I love ...... you. I love you Odie."

"Ah ♡ young master...... no, you can't ...... do that."

It's true that I love Odie, so there's nothing wrong with that.

I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea.

I gradually speeds up my pistoning motion while saying, "I like it, I like it, I like it.

"Mmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm.

"Huh, huh, oh, Odie ......!"

As my breathing became ragged and the movement of my hips became stronger, the bed began to creak and scream.

It seems that the bed is not as sturdy as it should be for a military base, as it is not designed for sex.

I intertwine my fingers with Odie's hand, which wobbles in the air, and shake my hips even harder.

"Young master, you're good, mmm, hmm, ahhh, ahhh, ♡ yes, haha......"

The sudden desire to ejaculate overflowed from my mouth.

Then Odie quickly picked up the words and gently put her hands around my waist.

"Haa, haa, ...... young master I'll take it all in."

"Agh! Oh, Odie!"

As the entire rod reached the limit of tension, it stiffened horribly, and the glans swelled at once.

I held both of Odie's legs in my hands and put her in a gyrating position.

With a press of my cock, I thrust my cock into her, opening the final door to ejaculation.

"I'm coming!　Odie!　Odie!"

Following the force and gravity of my ejaculation, my semen plunged vigorously into her vagina and then into her womb.

As my legs trembled from the strain on the backs of my thighs, I continued to spit my seed out instinctively, drool strings hanging from my mouth.

"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."

"Oh ...... Ody ....... Ohhhh ♡ I'm coming out, Ody ...... take it all in, take it all in ......"

"Yes. Oh, young master, there's so much coming out ......♡ Your cock is working so hard ....... "

As Odie rubbed my hips and back, the rhythm of the rubbing made more semen drip out of me.

It was as if she was squeezing the semen out of my balls as if she were squeezing out a tube of toothpaste that was running low.

My body, wrapped in her loving care, continued to pour out semen as if it were choking on life.

"Nn...... young master, my breasts."

"Yes ♡."

I immediately sucked on the breast that was offered to me.

I sucked on the nipple, making a chirping sound, and loosened the movement of my hips to let out all the semen.

I closed my eyes, letting the semen drip out of me like urine, as I no longer had the energy to fight my sleep demon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 115 - I obtained a servant who used to babysit me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I woke up, I was lying in a dark room where not even starlight could reach.

I could tell from the warmth I felt next to me that Odie was beside me.

I magically turned on a small light and found her face lying right next to mine.

In a bed with several layers of fuzzy blankets, I seemed to be clinging to Odie's female body.

I must have been hugging her like a koala ever since my post-coital ejaculation.

They say that if you get lost in the mountains in winter, two people can huddle together to keep warm.

Similarly, the thick layers of blankets kept our body heat inside, making it very hot and uncomfortable.

Even though it was a winter night, I felt a little sweaty.

".Young master...."

"Mmm, Odie."

Odie noticed that I was awake and woke up in the dim light.

I pressed my skin, which was slightly moist with sweat, to hers, and I brought my lips to hers.

"Chuu ♡"

"Chuu ♡"

Unlike our sex, now that I was lying on my side, I was able to kiss her more intensively than just on the mouth.

I cupped the back of Odie's head and tasted her tongue against mine.

After the deepest kiss of the night, I parted our lips slightly and continued our conversation, the tips of our noses rubbing together.

"...... Odie. It was really, really good.

"Thank you very much. Young master looked great. You're getting so big. ......"

I run my hand over Odie's skin, pressing my lips against it repeatedly.

There's a sticky substance stuck to her skin in places, probably my saliva or semen.

I feel like if I go to sleep like this, I'll be a shiny mess in the morning, but I honestly don't feel like getting out of bed to clean myself up. We're both ready for bed.

"Ah ♡"

"Oh...That's amazing."

I touched my hand to her inner thigh and was surprised to find it flooded with fluid.

From the feel of it, most of this must be my semen. The blanket must have smelled like a lot of cum.

"That's a lot of cum."

"Yes. I could feel a lot of it pouring into me. ......"

In the blanket, I could vaguely feel Odie's hand on my stomach.

I guess she was conscious of the large amount of my seed that had been planted in her.

I hugged her and kissed her deeply again.

"I'm sorry I pushed you tonight. But I really wanted to hold Odie."

I'd like to keep Odie's mind firmly in place for a stable sex life in the future.

She will continue to work close to me. I don't want to be distant from her.

"Young master, no need for such apologies. ...... I'm glad to feel your heart, too."

"Really? I'll forgive your refusal, but I won't forgive your lies.

"I would never lie to you, young master."

From Odie's reaction, it seemed that she was really not offended by my request.

I let out a sigh of relief and hugged Odie tightly.

"I'm glad. Please continue to work with me."

"Yes, sir. But, young master ......"

Odie's expression clouded as she said this.

She bent her head to a slightly face down angle, rested her forehead on my shoulder and continued to whisper her words.

"I'm infertile. ...... Even if you give me your precious baby seed, I will probably ......"

Odie and her husband do not have any children.

The fact that infertility is often thought of as a woman's problem is no different on the continent of Eruo. Rather, there is a strong atmosphere that makes it difficult to say that the man is at fault.

Odie also believes that her inability to have children is due to her own physical problems. In reality, no one on the medical level of the Eruo continent can determine which is worse.

"I think I know better than any of the other servants that you are kind. If you pity me for not being able to produce a child, you may visit ......."

"Odie."

I put my finger to Odie's lips and interrupted her.

"I'm not pitying you. I want to hold Odie because I love her. I'd love to have a baby. But I'd be happy enough to have Odie accept me."

"Mm......"

"So, Odie. Just for the occasional business trip. Would you be willing to give in to my feelings?"

Although it wouldn't be just an occasional business trip. I would ravish her even at New Nellie's Castle, this is my way of saying that I care about Odie.

The information that she was infertile would be known by those in the castle and the knightly family, whether it was correct or not.

If rumors spread that she was in my favor, Odie would be subjected to these sorts of insults. 'You can't even produce a child, but you're the one who gets attention of aristocrats.'

It is said that aristocratic men are generally partial to only a few women. If there is someone who is infertile in one of those precious slots, there is no doubt that the wind will be strong.

The rumor of Wilk being a womanizer seems to be spreading among the Quardenze and knightly families, but there is always the suspicion that he might suddenly turn prejudiced.

That's why I implied that I wanted to hold Odie in my harem rather than as a one-off type of thing.

I removed my finger from Odie's lips and waited for a response.

"Yes. I know how much love Young Master has. I would be happy to continue to receive your love, even if it is only for a short time."

Judging by the firmness of his statement, Odie must be saying that she understood my concern.

I nodded lightly and slowly brought my lips close to hers.

"Chuu ♡"

"Mmm, chuu ♡"

This time, Odie extended her tongue and I welcomed it with open arms.

We shared the longest kiss yet, and I pulled away from Odie.

"Odie. Let me see your belly."

It may have been futile, but I decided to cast a healing spell on Odie. It was probably the best healing I could do on the continent of Eruo, making full use of my vast magical power.

When Odie saw the band of light that began to glow on my arm, she immediately recognized it as the light of healing.

"Ah, young master. That ...... was actually used once by the Master."

"Father?"

It is not so easy to receive healing magic from the head of a noble family. It is not possible to benefit from it unless you are the head of a knightly family or their heir.

I've healed people from the knightly family a few times, but my father can't move as easily as I can.

It seems that my father had cast a healing spell on Odie. It seems that he was a father who had a soft spot for his daughter.

Well, if a beautiful girl like Odie was suffering from infertility, it was no wonder he would secretly cast a healing spell or two on her.

"I'm sorry to say, but I've tried before. It's ...... impossible."

Healing magic is not a convenient way to fix everything. It is more like a magic that returns the body to its original state.

In other words, if your body is incapable of conception from the moment you are born, healing magic will only return it to its original state, that is, incapable of conception.

"I see. But this is just for my own satisfaction. Odie. Would you like to be healed by me?"

"Thank you so much ......."

She was a little teary-eyed at the end, but I didn't care and launched my healing magic at Odie's stomach.

The aurora-like light danced and disappeared in a scattering of light particles.

No matter how much magic power you have, you can't do what you can't do. As I told Odie, it's self-satisfaction.

But Odie was so happy with my concern that she buried her head in my chest and shivered.

I stroked Odie's hair and wished her good luck with her sperm.

Chapter 116 - Imperial Knight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was only two ejaculations, but I felt very tired because of the amount of cum that came out.

I tried to sleep for five more minutes, which became ten more, and so on, until I realized that it was already early afternoon.

As Odie wiped me dry of last night's bodily fluids, I checked my schedule for the day.

"The Grand Master will be back before dawn."

Tesh said, not caring that I smelled a little like semen.

Odie carefully wiped my erect penis with a wet cloth and prepared to put on my underwear.

"That's not a good idea. I'm afraid I've kept your grandfather waiting."

Tesh said as she slipped her legs into her underwear.

"No, the Grand Master is having a meeting this morning."

"A meeting?"

"I'm sorry, I don't know the details."

If Tesh, who knows almost everything, didn't know about it, it must be a military-related meeting.

"Call the military commander. I'll check on grandfather's schedule."

"Very well, sir."

Tesh left the room and I was left alone with Odie.

She was up and ready before I was, and there was no trace of sex on her body.

As I watched her buttoning my jacket in the same manner as usual, I began to think that last night's mating had been a dream.

"Excuse me."

The military officer entered the room a few moments after the call.

It was obvious from his attire that he was a soldier with a title, and after some thought I remembered his name.

I don't remember the exact title, but the fact that I remembered his name meant that he must be one of the senior military officers. The way he greeted me, he seemed to be in good form.

After making sure Odie was out of the room, I asked him about his grandfather's schedule.

"The general is meeting with a visitor this morning, and I've been asked to show you around if it's convenient for you."

"I see. Well then, please show me the way."

I was hungry, but it was bearable, so I decided to meet my grandfather first.

I took the letter that Tesh had prepared for me and left the room with the military officer.

The officer led me to another hut, and then to a room where my grandfather was waiting for me.

"It's been a long time, Wilk."

"It's been a long time, Grandfather. How are you?"

My grandfather was not the only person in the conference room. There was an old man sitting face to face with my grandfather, who must have arrived this morning.

My grandfather was over 80 years old, and this old man looked about the same age.

When the old man saw me, he stood up with agile movements that belied his age, and put his left hand on his waist in a goo pose and his right hand on his chest in a par pose.

His movements were those of a knight waiting to be introduced. Apparently, the old man belonged to a knightly family.

"Ah, let me introduce myself first. I'm a knight of the land that I've known for a long time. Here, say your name."

The old knight, with his grandfather's permission, said his family name and the name of the nobleman who was his lord in a crisp tone.

The nobleman was not a member of the Kingdom of Levios, but a member of the Zinkhaen Empire.

The Quardenze are going around waging war against the nobility of the Empire, but they are not fighting against the entire Empire.

Because they are not fighting against the entire empire, some nobles are neutral or even allies to the Quardenze family.

Many nobles in the western part of the empire are supporting the Quardenze family from behind the scenes. They are politically opposed to the nobles in the eastern part of the Empire.

Even in the Levios Kingdom, the eastern and western parts of the empire do not get along well, but the empire is even worse than that. How bad is it?

The old knight's lord, a nobleman, was also one of the imperial nobles who supported the Quardenze family.

In other words, the old knight was probably here to discuss a backroom alliance.

"This is the first time Wilk has met an imperial knight?"

"Yes."

I've never been out in imperial territory before in my life, so I've never met an imperial knight or even an imperial nobleman.

In the event that you're looking for the best way to get the most out of your business, you'll want to take a look at the following tips.

"I'm retired now, Master Galfis."

The way he speaks with sharp eyes and an easy to understand austere voice, he seems more like an active knight than a retired old man.

"An imperial knight?"

"It used to be called that"

The head of the knight is the only person in a position that can be strictly called a knight. This is the same for the empire and the kingdom.

When he sees an old knight stubbornly denying that he is not a knight because he is no longer the family head, his grandfather laughs.

"He is as obstinate as ever. You’d better be a knight for the trouble."

"But, Mr. Galfiz,"

The familiar exchange between my grandfather, who spoke to me carelessly, and the old knight in a somewhat troubled tone suggested a close friendship.

I had read in books about the city ruled by the old knight's family, and I thought of the words of greeting to return to him, remembering about it.

He has taught me, in these places, that it is important for the society of the nobles to show off their faculties in a smooth way.

It is a natural knowledge for an aristocrat to know the location of his territory after hearing the names of the aristocrats' families, but few of them even remember the lands and cities which the knight family governed. This is the case with knights from other countries.

"Grandfather, could you introduce me as well?"

Since it was not my turn, I urged my grandfather.

He turned his hand toward me and began a brief introduction.

"It's not too late to introduce you to my grandson. It will not be long before he is officially named as the next head of the Quardenze family. He's very studious, just like Luke. This is a good opportunity for you to teach him about the current state of the Empire."

"Yes, if I can help."

The old knight gave his approval lightly and looked at me at the same time as his grandfather.

I gave a long, formal speech that was typical of aristocracy, and stated my name.

"I'm the legitimate son of the family of Quardenze, Quardenze Wilk."

Normally, this would have been the end of my greeting, but since my grandfather had thrown me a good pass, I decided to show off my knowledge.

"I'm glad to hear that you are willing to share your story with us. As you know, there are no seas in the Quadrant, although there are great rivers. We don't have any knights who have experience in governing ports, so I'm expecting to hear some fresh stories."

In the knight's self-introduction, he does not mention the name of the city or land that the knight family rules. This is because the right to rule that a knight has is something that is entrusted to him by the main noble family.

In other words, the principal family of the nobility and the family of the knight are the only two sources of judgment for the city to be governed by the family of the old knight.

If my memory is correct, the old knight's house would have governed some of the country's westernmost ports.

The old knight showed a slight reaction when he mentioned the element of knight governing a port town. I was convinced that my guess was correct, and then I mentioned the name of the city.

"Ho..."

The old knight opened his eyes and looked at me, for he did not expect that he even knew where the imperial knight ruled.

"You remind me of Marquis Quardenze."

I'm always studying because I wanted to be thought of by Fanny as a smart, wonderful brother.

All the aristocrats of the Kingdom of Levios and Zinkhaen, of course, can be said in the sky, and I also remember the information about the historic cities and knights.

The old knight gazes at me with a nostalgic look, as if he were looking at my father in his image.

"You look just like the Marquis Quardenze when he was young. I miss your silvery eyes."

My grandfather, who reacted sharply to the old knight's line, clapped his hands and looked at me as if he remembered something.

"Now that you mention it, Wilk, There's one thing I want to ask, all right?"

"What is it?"

He was approached with a fierce face and held his shoulders. It was a considerable force.

"I heard a rumor, is it true that you have defeated a demonic beast?"

The soldiers who were traveling back and forth between Nambonan City and this base had picked up rumors about the defeat of a demonic beast.

My grandfather wanted to go back to New Nellie to find out the truth, but after being placated by the military officers around him, he seemed to have lost his nerve.

"Yes, sir. The rumor has already reached your grandfather, hasn't it? I think it may have been mentioned in a letter from your father.

"I see. ......! Of course! Well done! That's Cassia's grandson!"

My grandfather had a big smile on his face, put his hands in my sides and lifted me up.

I didn't expect him to give me a "takai takai" at the age of 12.

My grandfather, who was well over 80 years old, lifted me with ease, even though I had no problem growing up as a 12-year-old boy. I know I'm fine because I'm strengthened by magic, but I'm worried that my bones will break.

Holding me in his arms, my grandfather opened his mouth excitedly.

"So, where did you defeat the demonic beast0? Evermill? Gatoren? It wasn't Nambonan, was it?　I'm not proud of a mature demonic beast from Nambonan, that's for sure.

A demonic beast is born inside a field and takes a long time to grow before it can venture out into the world.

But in a small field, there seems to be a limit to how much they can grow, and they only mature halfway. In other words, they are half-ripe.

They need a certain scale to grow into powerful magical beasts. In the case of such halfway mature magical beasts, they can be easily defeated by nobles or even by knights alone.

There are only small fields in the vicinity of Nambonan City, and the mature demonic beast that are born there are nothing to brag about even if they are defeated.

For a moment, I wondered if I should let the old knight of the empire hear about it, but my grandfather was in a hurry, so I decided to tell him.

The rumor will reach the empire sooner or later anyway.

"In New Nellie."

I say, and my grandfather drops me to the floor.

The old knight opened his eyes wide and looked at me.

"New Nellie?"

"You can't be ...... in New Nellie City!"

The New Nellie field is the larger one in the Kingdom of Levios. In terms of large and medium-sized enterprises, it would fall under the category of large-scale fields.

The larger the field, the stronger the mature beast, and the more terrible the mischief it spreads.

"What about the damage!? Is Luxe and Fanny safe!?"

My grandfather lifted me up this time as if to close it up. It is the feeling of junior high school students playing with a fly.

"Guh...I'm all right. There was little damage."

I explained that I happened to be near the outer gate of the city and immediately entered the battle, and that I was isolated without returning to the castle.

There are several kinds of mystical beasts and disasters, but the most frightening is a strange disease. In some cases, even the powerful and lifelike nobles can be killed.

My grandfather also naturally understands the horror.

"Father, mother, and Fanny was in the castle, and I was the only one who made contacted with it directly. I don't think I'll get infected in that situation."

After hearing that, my grandfather exhales greatly.

"In any case, if they get infected, they'll can be cured anyways."

The mysterious disease caused by a monster disaster can be cured by a magician's magician push.

My father and my grandfather would recognize my magical powers, and they would manage it if they came to.

Thus, my grandfather was relieved to see that I had performed healing magic before.

"But the New Nellie had a demonic beast...I can't believe it at all. Luke must have been careful about that..."

"Dear Galfiz, the Mature Beast is not defended by the knowledge of man alone. No matter how much we try, it always comes out when we leave."

The old knight said, turning his eyes to me, and continuing his words.

"I'd like to hear about how Wilk fought. The New Nellie beast would have been a disaster once in hundreds of years, right?"

"I'd like to hear it as well Wilk. What kind of beast did you encounter?"

For aristocrats and knights, the story of defeating mature monsters seems to be very good. The old knight was calm, but his eyes were open with anticipation.

The Knight, who was on his way to Nambonan City, had often spoken to him, and the story of the defeat of the beasts seemed to have went smoothly.

After talking about the whole process and finishing the question time, my grandfather became delighted.

"Mmmm ...... is the beast stone on display alongside the magic stone of Cassian? Now I want to go back to New Nellie and take a look at it."

"There is also the magic stone of the devil that Mr. Cassia was killed. I was anxious to see it once."

The demonic beast I defeated was dismantled and a special magical stone that can only be obtained from a mature demonic beast.

These are like crystals of honor for the nobles, so they don't sell them easily. They are usually kept as family heirlooms.

"Would you like to come with me to New Nellie? Then you can become a knight of Quardenze. I need as many knights as I can trust right now. I'm sure you'll be able to take care of some of the cities with ease. Yes, for example, ......."

In a half-serious tone, my grandfather began headhunting the old knight.

The proposal was realistic and did not seem to have been improvised just now. I think my grandfather had been looking for a chance to get this old knight for a long time.

The Quardenze family needed to increase the number of knights because their territory had increased due to the invasion war. The existing branch of the knight family may not be enough in some areas.

But the old knight remained polite and refused his grandfather's offer, citing his advanced age.

"It's a tempting offer, but I don't think I have long to live. I don't think I can rule without shame as a knight of Quardenze."

"I suppose."

My grandfather didn't seem to have any intention of forcing him. Perhaps because they were close in age.

"...But, Mr. Galfiz,"

With these words the old knight sat up as much as to say that this was the show.

"Permit me, not as a knight, but as one of your warriors, to enter into the siege of Othelloria."

The city of Othelloria is the stronghold of the dukes who unite the old Voistra, a large faction of the eastern nobility of the Empire.

The fall of this city and the murder of the duke who controls it has been a long-cherished wish of my grandfather.

"In order to avenge the death of Lord Gardakul, and to avenge the death of Lady Kasia. That is my last hope."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 117 - Meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quardenze Gardakul.

He was the first male child born to my grandfather Galfis and my grandmother Kasia. He was a little older brother to my father Luke, and from my point of view, he was my uncle.

My uncle was a "respectable aristocrat" with an anecdote that he impregnated three of his maids a month after he met them, and was trusted by his parents as well as his younger brother, who had high hopes for his future.

But my uncle died long before I was born. It is said that it was not an accident or illness, but a conspiracy murder by the hands of the old Voistra.

Incidentally, not only my uncle but also his wife, whom he had just married from the Silopeia family, was killed together with him. Thus, the old Voistra earned the grudges of the families of Quardenze and Silopeia.

And that's about all I know about it, but I have no idea about the details.

If I wanted to find out more about someone on the continent of Luo, I would either have to ask someone or look it up in a book, since there was no such thing as a convenient search site.

At that time, however, my grandmother Kasia was still the head of the Quardenze family, and my uncle Gardakul was just a nobleman's son. His name is rarely found in books.

In a case like this, it is best to hear from others, but unfortunately, the topic of my uncle's death was taboo in the Quardenze family.

"The city of Othelloria is at hand."

My grandfather said in a voice so low that I thought it was coming from the depths of the earth.

The old knight and I waited for him to continue in silence, as if we were in a bind.

"The castle will take shape in the spring. So make sure you're ready, okay?"

It was clear that he was saying it unexpectedly. The old knight seemed to understand this, and thanked my grandfather.

I wondered if it was okay to talk about confidential information to someone from the Empire, but I guess it's okay. No matter how cerebral my grandfather was, he would never make a mistake in war-related matters. I guess he's talking because it's the right thing to do.

I've also written in my notepad that there might be a war against the nobility next year.

If I were to join them in the war, I might have a chance to enjoy the princesses of the dukes and other noble families.

There are several ways to treat the princesses of destroyed noble families, and one of them is to spend the rest of their lives as cum dumpsters.

Slightly excited, my grandfather continued in a tone that maintained his tension.

"Twenty years..."

That was the time since he had started picking fights with the Imperial nobility.

"It's been twenty years since I left Quardenze in the hands of Luke. I have come ...... this far. I'm not sure what to make of it."

"Yes. I never imagined that I would be able to come this far in such a short time, when I heard of Master Galfis' decision that day."

"I'm not the only one. I've been thinking about it for a while. I'm not sure I'd have thought of that. I have had many miscalculations."

I know very well that my father adored my uncle Gardakul. It seems that my grandfather intended to spend the rest of his life laying the groundwork for revenge for my father.

While I was thinking about this, my grandfather came up to me and gently patted my head.

"Wilk. I owe it all to you.

"Yes?"

Seeing my confusion, the old knight opened his mouth.

"I've heard that it was Master Wilk who turned New Nellie silk into an industry. Silk is very popular in the Empire, but it is hard to come by. By lending New Nellie silk, I was able to secretly win over some of the nobility."

Silk is considered a luxury item because of its texture and beauty, and wearing a dress made of it is a status as an aristocrat.

However, the silk produced in the Mamshred Federation is not something that can be easily purchased by simply piling up gold coins. There are a limited number of them, so you need to have connections with merchants who deal in them.

The Black Desert, the largest desert on the continent, stretches between the Mamshred Federation and the Zinkhaen Empire, so if you wanted to transport silk, you would have to make a very large detour. Therefore, the silk merchants sell most of the imported silk within the Kingdom of Levios.

In order to obtain a large amount of silk, it would inevitably require a huge amount of money and the intercession of the kingdom's nobles, so it seems that the imperial nobility was clearly divided into two factions: those who could buy silk and those who could not.

However, I had suddenly made New Nellie silk I had made. Although it is not pure white silk, which is the highest quality, demand for it is still very high.

According to the old knight, by offering the silk trade to some of the opportunistic Imperial nobles, he was able to turn them into advocates of the Quardenze family or move them to complete neutrality.

The silk was just an experiment I made that I abandoned, but my father seems to have used it as a behind the scenes, as the nobleman he was.

"There's the silk, but there's more. Then there's the healing, there's the war, and lately, there's Nambonan City."

According to my grandfather, some of the money I earned was used to pay for the war, and my powerful healing magic kept the number of magical troops from dwindling.

After the war, Nambonan City seems to have become very supportive of my grandfather, and the construction of the castle is progressing efficiently.

"Is that so? I'm glad to hear that I'm helping you avenge uncle's death."

I hadn't really been involved in my grandfather's imperial invasion, so it was good to learn about that aspect of his life. I'll try to do more to help.

It's better to have a clear enemy dealt with while my grandfather is still alive, so that it will be easier for me when I take over the Quardenze family in the future.

"Oh, by the way, Master Wilk has never met Master Gardakul, has he?"

"Yes, I've never met him."

When I was talking about this with the old knight, my grandfather chuckled.

"It's funny how similar your behaviors are, even though you've never even spoken to Gardakul."

"Gardakul? By behavior you  mean...?"

"Yes."

I guess my uncle's love of sex is really rare, because that's all I hear about him.

My grandson loves sex! I can't imagine my grandfather boasting that his grandson loves sex! I wish I could get used to this feeling, but I still feel a gap.

"If that's the case, then the Quardenze army will be safe in the future."

The Quardenze army is strong.

There are several reasons for this strength, but the biggest reason is that there are many soldiers with magical powers and followers.

Even though it is an army, it is mostly made up of commoners who have no magical power. I would say that less than 1% of the army is made up of mages.

These few mages are useful in any kind of operation.

They can be used for alerting with detection magic, healing wounded soldiers with healing magic, and strengthening commoner troops with magic for an assault if they are on the front line.

If soldiers without magic power are rats, their mages are cats. It would be like a human with a bow and spear challenging a main battle tank.

In short, just by adding one more mage to the army, the range of tactics would suddenly increase.

The reason why there are so many mages in the army of Quardenze, is because they are the children left behind by my uncle.

My uncle had a history of eating not only the daughters of knightly families, but also the daughters of commoners in his domain. That's why there are many children with magical powers born here and there in the Quardenze territory.

My grandfather hired the children of my uncle as military officers and warriors, and gave them special training to build an imperial invasion force.

"In that sense, Wilk will make things easier for us. We were going to have a hard time governing because our territory was too spread out. Fufufu."

The expansion of one's territory is good, but it is a concern due the lack of people.

Unlike Earth, we can't leave our territories unattended just because we can't manage them. This is because it would become a source of mature demonic beasts.

It is said that land contaminated by mature monsters will not even grow grass for several years, and will not be restored for several years to several decades, or even 100 to 200 years if the contamination is severe.

Land management is the most important job for nobles. If they are sloppy, they will be underestimated by other families.

Incidentally, the mature demonic beast that came to New Nellie City the other day was defeated in its early stages, and the pollution is mild. It will probably be gone within a few years.

"What do you think?　Have you found a knight's daughter you like? Don't be shy, I will do as Wilk wishes."

I smiled vaguely at my grandfather, who chuckled.

I'm not sure I'm familiar enough with the continent yet to be able to smile and say that I was having sex with Odie, the daughter of a knightly family, last night.

"I envy you. There is a shortage of cousin's children everywhere right now."

The hardships of securing a child with magical powers seem to be the same in both kingdoms and empires. I'm not sure what to make of it.

What if he asks me to give him my sperm?

"Master Wilk, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of women do you prefer?"

"I'm not sure if he's like Luke, but he like older women. In Nambonan City, I believe it's ......."

For some reason, it was my grandfather who answered my question.

I don't know who told him this, but he spoke eloquently and in strange detail about Anna's and Kohli's physical characteristics, just like a grandfather who wants to show off his grandchildren.

"...so you like older women?"

"Well, that's not it. It doesn't matter at all if it's a ...... beautiful woman, even if she's younger."

The old knight nodded in a slightly implicated tone.

As for me, if she has a lovely face or a beautiful figure, she is always a perfect welcome for my dick.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 118 - Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the meeting, I had lunch with my grandfather and the old knight.

It would have been awkward if he had been telling tales of my sexual endeavors, so I arranged for the old knight to talk to me during the meal.

As I had never really left the territory of Quardenze, the story of the old knight who lived in the territory of the Empire was very interesting to me.

What was particularly interesting was the story of the sea surrounding the continent of Eruo.

According to the old knight, there are huge carnivorous marine creatures lurking in the sea, and the currents are all over the place without any regularity. And far away in the ocean, he said, you can see the misty shadows of fields that are much larger than the land.

The old knight said that magical beasts also occur in the sea, and mature magical beasts are born there.

The old knight said that in the sea field, where humans can't go to defeat them, mature magical beasts breed without limit, and occasionally a tide of contaminated poison reaches the coast, tormenting the fishermen.

I had never seen a book that described the world outside of the continent of Luo before, and now I could understand why.

The level of civilization on the continent of Eruo, which can only build wooden ships, is incapable of breaking through this vicious sea.

Until a powerful warship or plane is developed, the continent will remain isolated. This continent is like a small colony.

After finishing lunch, the old knight said he would return to the imperial territory as soon as possible.

Even though he was retired, it seemed to be a source of unwanted trouble for a member of the Imperial Knight family to stay at the military base of the Quardenze family forever.

My grandfather seemed to understand this point and didn't particularly try to stop me. He must have finished what he had to say before I entered the conference room.

"Well then, Master Galfis. I will come as a warrior next time."

"I'll be waiting."

The old knight exchanged parting words with his grandfather and then came towards me.

"It was a pleasure to meet you, Master Wilk."

Then the old knight turned his gaze away from me for a moment, as if in thought, and his face became one of concealed emotion.

The old knight spoke slowly, his face still stiffened.

"Please give my regards to Duke Quardenze as well."

When the Kingdom of Levios was founded, it created five titles. When I write in my diary, I translate them into Japanese as duke, marquis, count, viscount, and baron from the top.

Originally, these titles were Eruo words, so they are not homonyms. In Japanese, "duke" and "marquis" are indistinguishable from "koshaku," but they can be heard as different words in Luo.

In addition, there are five titles in the Jinkaen Empire. The Zinkhaen Empire also has five titles, because it follows the example of its predecessor, the Kingdom of Levios, in the details.

I knew immediately that the old knight had deliberately said "Duke of Quardenze".

Thinking that this would be a conversation as a nobleman, I think about how I should reply.

"This bastard..."

Then my grandfather slapped the old knight on the head and gave him a dumbfounded look.

"It's not like you to play games in conversation. You must have caught a cold from breathing the tasteless air of the east."

"I'm sorry, ....... I have not seen the sea for a long time, and I seem to have lost my temper."

The old knight straightened his posture, apologized to me, and bid me farewell once again in the proper manner.

Thinking about what he was trying to say, I returned the greeting as usual.

"Master Wilk, I look forward to seeing you again."

The old knight's eyes twinkled brightly as he pushed aside his deeply wrinkled eyelids and looked at me.

I'm not sure what to make of this. During the meal, he asked me several times about the type of woman I liked.

For example, he asked me what I thought of this kind of woman, and he gave me some very specific examples. Perhaps the old knight's family had a daughter like that.

I'd like to check with my father later to see if it's okay to sire a daughter of an imperial knight's family.

As I watched the old knight saddle his horse and walk away, I thought about having sex with a daughter I hadn't seen yet.

I returned to the meeting room and my grandfather and I picked up the tea prepared by Tesh.

The scent of the steaming flowers tickles the nostrils.

"Is my grandfather going to spend the new year here?"

"Yes, he is. I have to keep a close eye on him here. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that we've had a few enemy knights come by to scout the area."

Every year, the family spends the New Year's Eve in a relaxed atmosphere, and at the beginning of the year, the knights of the squire relationship come to greet them.

Unfortunately, my grandfather seems to be spending the New Year's Eve and New Year's Day alone at this frontline military base.

It would be a shame if the enemy were to take this base that was taking shape.

Even my grandfather, who is ready to kill the enemy with their base in sight, would not want to leave this place.

If, as my grandfather said, the knights of the old Voistra lineage were watching vigilantly for an opportunity, we couldn't afford to let them get away with it.

If they find out that my grandfather is not here, the army led by the nobleman will surely attack this base.

No matter how powerful the Quardenze army was, it would be no match for a defensive battle against the nobles who possessed the magical power of the main ancestor.

Only the nobility can deal with the nobility.

I'll be sure to keep an eye on New Nellie. I'm sure Wilk has read the letter from Luke, right?　Be especially careful with the Holy High Society."

The letter from my father that I received the other day described the results of the expeditionary force that entered the New Nellie field.

This is the unit that set out to determine the identity of the mysterious man from the Holy High Society who possesses the main ancestor level magic power that Lupetta had seen inside the field.

"What does grandfather think about the Holy High Society?"

Since a mature demonic beast progresses while rotting the earth, it is possible to determine where it originated by following its tracks.

The expedition team found out that the place where the mature demonic beast was found was the place where Lupetta used the mana crystal to defeat the master class mystery man.

Near the site, there was a man who had been sucked dry by leeches, and a group of four members of the Holy High Society dressed as adventurers were lying on the verge of starvation.

It was said that the area where the upper and lower halves of the main ancestor's body were lying was uncommonly polluted by the earth. It was as if a mature demonic beast had been born from that rotten earth.

"It's hard to believe."

"Yes, it is. It is still a hypothesis that demonic beasts grow by feeding on people with magical powers..."

Demonic beasts grow by feeding on other demonic beasts in the field. In the world of the weak and the strong, they accumulate power by taking in the flesh and blood of their opponents.

If they can be strengthened by simply eating something strong, then it seems that if it can devour a person with magical power, it will be able to grow even stronger.

I searched the literature on demonic beasts, but I couldn't find any research to support this.

It seems that no mad scientist would think of feeding a human being with valuable magical power to demonic beasts.

However, it is hard to believe that the situation where the main ancestor-level mystery man was eaten up and the birth of a mature demonic beast in the New Nellie Field, which is said to be a once-in-a-hundred-years disaster, would coincide.

Personally, I would like to try the experiment on a small scale field.

"No."

"No?"

Then my grandfather slowly denied it and looked at me.

"I can't believe that people would try to create a demonic beast, even if they had the means to create a mature demonic beast like Wilk and Luke say. It's unbelievable that people would want to do so. Noblemen and priests, although they are in different positions, it is their duty and pride to protect the land where their people live from demonic beasts. ......"

In the Holy High Society, there are beings called high priests. The high priests are all people who belong to the Patriarch.

The high priest is responsible for spreading the teachings of the Zeth religion while also ruling the area in which he is assigned. As such, they have the same rationale for ruling as the nobility: "We are protecting the people and the land where wheat grows from magical beasts."

My grandfather must have thought that the holy priests, which would understand such values, would never do anything like unleashing demonic beasts.

A suicide bombing that pollutes the earth seems to be an incomprehensible act for those who live in the continent of Eruo. Having lived in Japan in a previous life, I can't sympathize, but I can understand.

Either way, the truth will come out sooner or later, since we were able to secure four of the perpetrators, even though they were on the verge of starvation.

They must be undergoing a lot of torture in the name of interrogation at the military base in New Nellie City right now.

"Your father was deciding whether or not to announce they were undergoing torture. It would be good for the cause of the Levios royal family, and it might trigger a war of sanctions against Saint Navenpos.

Since the Levios royal family wants to invade St. Navenpos, they are likely to organize the kingdom's army with great excitement once this matter is revealed.

If the Royal Army of Levios, a coalition of all the nobles of the kingdom, and St. Navenpos were to start a war, my grandfather's plan to invade the empire would be ruined.

As expected, my grandfather distorted his face in displeasure.

"Hmm. The Levios family can do that on their own. It has nothing to do with the Quardenze family. If it comes to it, just ignore it."

There was no way that the Quardenze family, who had actually been terrorized, was irrelevant.

If we were to invade, I think it would look bad if the Quardenze family, the victims, didn't participate.

"Are you ignoring the royal family?"

"Yes. The House of Levios is nothing to be afraid of, having been taken advantage of by the House of Myrendorva."

Until just a few years ago, the Levios royal family was in a state of civil war with the Myrendorva noble family.

As a result of the decades-long battle with repeated ceasefires and truce, the Levios Kingdom gained one more title, bringing the total to six. The increased title was higher than that of a duke, so I translate it as Grand Duke.

The increased title was given to the Duke of Myrendorva, and he became the Grand Duke of Myrendorva. Although the division of the kingdom was avoided, in effect, the royal family lost.

It is rumored that a large scale social gathering will be held in the capital next spring, and this is said to be aimed at appealing both at home and abroad that this civil war has been gathered.

"...... Well, Father didn't seem to be interested in invading the Holy City, so I'm sure he'll do something about it."

"Yes, Now, Luke would be able to round up the Capital's people."

Although the kingdom of Levios called itself a state, the aristocrats who constituted it were guaranteed independent autonomy.

Some acts such as the prohibition of war among the aristocrats of kingdoms were prohibited by law, but basically they were not interfered with in the internal affairs of state.

This is largely related to the historical background.

The Kingdom of Levios was established on the basis of the independence of the nobility from the Holy High Society. Therefore, it has a tradition of valuing the independence of the noble families.

Therefore, all noble families have the right to veto orders from the state, although they may be expelled from the kingdom if they are not careful.

In this respect, the Zinkhaen Empire is a mishmash of princes, but the concept of independence is less common in the Zinkhaen Empire than in the Kingdom of Levios.

If the emperor declares, "We will unanimously declare war against the Quardenze family, which is attacking the imperial nobility," all of the imperial nobility will have no choice but to join the war.

In addition, the current emperor has not issued an order of war against the Quardenze family. ...... No, he cannot.

This is partly due to the backdoor maneuvering of the Quardenze family, but the biggest reason is that the current emperor has no power.

If he were to give the order to engage in war, there is a very high probability that the noble families that oppose the order would collude and the empire would be split in two.

This is why the current emperor is unable to give orders.

The Zinkhaen Empire, which had aimed for centralized power and at one time had shown a momentum that could have surpassed that of the Levios Kingdom, was now a thing of the past.

It is unable to properly unite the noble families and could collapse at any moment.

The Leviathans were losing their centripetal force, and the fraying of the Zinkhaen Empire was becoming apparent.

Somehow, I sensed that an era of turmoil was approaching.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 119 - The Return Carriage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I spent the next few days at the base.

After all, building castles on the front lines was hard work for an old man in his eighties, and my grandfather didn't seem to be in very good shape.

Nobles can stay healthy as long as they have magic power, but stress can make them unwell.

It is said that wounds caused by battles between magicians heal on the surface, but the damage accumulates in the body.

My grandfather had spent his entire life fighting since he was a young boy, so he must have left many invisible scars under his skin.

The fact that his physical condition deteriorated even with the amount of magic power of his ancestor was proof that he had fought against so many nobles.

It is what we call an old wound of honor. The wound itself is not visible because it has been healed by healing magic.

And unfortunately, this is the only thing that cannot be cured even with powerful healing magic.

I think it's not because of the physical trauma, but because of the accumulation of magical residue from the attack magic, which makes the physical condition worse.

It's like how it's easy to heal a cut, but difficult to heal a body affected by mineral poisoning.

When I was concerned about the deteriorating health of my grandfather, who was still slaughtering the nobles and knights of the old Voistra, he approached me.

"Wilk. Please take this. This one is for Fanny."

"Yes."

I received a letter from my grandfather to my father, and also a gift for Fanny. Fanny had given her grandfather a fur winter coat as a gift, so he must have returned the favor.

The gift for Fanny came in a small wooden box, but I couldn't tell what was inside.

When my grandfather noticed that I was trying to guess what was in the box, he placed a bulging burlap sack on the desk.

"Here's your allowance."

"Thank you, sir."

The sack, a dirty little sack that aristocrats rarely picked up, was a picture-perfect coin purse. When he untied it and looked at the contents, he saw that it was filled with silver coins.

"What's this?"

"I've been accumulating them as I've been making the rounds of the neighboring villages. At first the villagers would offer me their daughters, but when I refused, they would give them to me.

My grandfather didn't go around the village to collect silver coins, but he accepted them without saying a word.

The villagers, frightened by the arrival of the Quardenze army, had given them their small amount of wealth in an attempt to curry favor.

If I had been with them, I would have been satisfied with just having sex with the village girls, but it was bad timing.

"I gave the other food and wine they gave me to the soldiers, and the silver to Wilk."

There was no one who could point out that I was mixing public and private affairs. Thus, I decided to accept it gratefully.

It was wonderful to see a village that would give up one of its daughter. The next time I come here, I would like to accompany them at all costs.

If you think about it, if you can get the seed of a nobleman, the village will have the child of a noble. Surprisingly, the people of the village might have some clever ideas.

The idea of offering one's daughter to a grandfather in his eighties to be sired by him was amazing.

By the way, in the village I visited once, where there were tea plantations, they kept encouraging me to have a daughter.

I wondered if she was still alive and well, since she was quite cute like Fanny.

I touched the silver coin with my index finger, my crotch half erect.　

"This is a silver coin of the Empire, isn't it?"

It was not the empire founding commemorative silver coin that I had found before, but an ordinary empire silver coin that was in general circulation.

Since this area was originally an imperial territory, it seems that imperial silver coins are still in circulation.

The Kingdom of Levios occasionally changes the design of their gold coins, so they have many different types of gold coins. In contrast, the Zinkhaen Empire often changes the design of its silver coins, so it has many types of silver coins.

"There are many types of silver coins. The reverse is ......."

I wondered what kind of silver coin it was, and when I picked one up, I saw that the reverse side was rough, as if it had been filed. I could not decipher the design that would have been on it.

I picked up a few other silver coins to see what they looked like, but they all looked the same.

The profile of the first emperor, Zinkhaeng, was still there on the front of the coin, but the reverse was completely unrecognizable.

Since most of the Imperial silver coins in circulation have the profile of the first emperor on the front and the current emperor on the back, the face that was scraped off must have been the profile of the third emperor.

As I was playing with the silver coin with my fingers, my grandfather opened his mouth.

"You can use it even without the back. Don't save them up, use them up at Nambonan."

"...... I understand."

In other words, it was probably a consistent negative campaign against the third emperor.

If a large amount of silver coins with the third emperor's face smashed into them were circulating in the empire and the kingdom, his reputation would be ruined.

Judging from the familiar tone of his grandfather's voice, he might have done something similar in the past. The image of soldiers being forced to do the chore of endlessly filing the backs of silver coins came to mind.

As my grandfather had said, the silver itself was valuable, so there was no problem in using it, even if it was slightly scraped off.

Since I had been given the money, I would use it quickly at the Nambonan market.

If you are going to help with a negative campaign, you want to use it in a way that will spread it to as many people as possible.

I took the burlap bag with the silver coins and headed straight for the carriage that Tesh and Odie had prepared for me.

The soldiers at the base had come to see me off, surrounding the carriage I was getting into.

I said one more goodbye to my grandfather and got into the carriage.

I found a bundle of letters in the corner of the carriage. These were letters written by the military officers at the base to their families and acquaintances in New Nelly City.

Since the military officers of the Quardenze army usually live in quarters in New Nellie City, they sometimes exchange letters like this during the expedition.

I looked out the small window, said farewell my grandfather one more time, and instructed Tesh to start the carriage.

The carriage soon picked up speed and the soldiers at the base became smaller and smaller.

I look out the window and notice that we're already going pretty fast.

Since Tesh is a magician, he uses his magic to drive the carriage. He reduces the vibrations and raises the strength of the horses to maintain the speed.

From the sensation of the wind as I poked my head out of the window, I felt like I was driving a moped at full throttle.

It was a mountainous road and the footing was not very good, but he didn't seem to mind.

"Young master. Would you like me to take the bag?"

Odie, sitting diagonally in front of me, said, looking at the bag of silver coins on my lap.

I closed the small window, turned to her, and held out the bag of silver coins. The bag is heavy and I don't intend to leave it on my lap.

"Put it somewhere else."

"Yes, sir."

After receiving the bag of silver coins, Odie bent down to place it in the corner of the carriage and began to adjust its placement.

Odie's hips were the only part of the carriage that shook. She seemed to be having a hard time rearranging the luggage in the cramped carriage.

During my stay at the base, I had lusted after Odie's body every night and poured my seed into her.

When I returned to Nambonan City, I would not have the opportunity to hold Odie, so I took advantage of the opportunity to sow my seed. There was no doubt that he ejaculated at least four times a night.

Odie, who thought she was infertile, tried to refuse and said, "It's a waste of precious sperm," right before I held her every night, but I completely ignored her advice.

My semen is not precious.

It will be stored up soon anyway, so I should just let it out when I can.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 120 - Eating my sister servant who gently takes care of my sexual needs (1/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I stood up just as Odie sat back down in her seat.

Wordlessly, I sat down next to her and put my arm around her waist.

"Oh ...... boy."

I responded with a chuckle, our lips meeting. Odie was taller than me, so I had to stand up straighter.

Odie must have gotten used to my demands over the past few days, because she slowly moved her face to rub her lips together and return my caress.

I thrust my tongue out, lured by the softness, and was entangled in her sticky mucous membrane.

The sound of sizzling water, which makes my cock hard just listening to it, echoes through the carriage. I wrapped my arm around her waist.

"Want to......?"

I asked, but I kept my body close to hers.

Tesh is seated at the carriage controls outside the carriage, and the guards are surrounding the carriage with their own riders.

There were only two people in the carriage, me and Odie. There was no problem in initiating sexual intercourse.

Odie, however, looked slightly confused.

Perhaps she was thinking that Tesh and the guards outside would hear about their affair.

"Odie, ......."

I called out her name in a slightly indulgent tone and buried my face in her chest.

It's hard to see the unevenness of her body because she's wearing a lot of heavy clothes to keep warm, but if I press my face a little harder, I can feel the symbol of motherhood underneath.

"Yes, I'll give you a lot of presents today, too."

She patted me on the head and said, "Good, good."

It's good that Odie spoils me when I make sweet gestures.

For the past few days, I've been having sex with Odie in a pampered way. I'm glad to see that Odie has gotten used to handling me.

As she began to slip out of her thick winter clothes, I began to undress as well.

"Wow..."

The sight of a woman taking off her clothes, especially a thick winter coat, is very intriguing.

It's really a sensational scene that reveals the hidden bulges and curves of a woman as each piece of cloth is removed, and it's enough to make my cock harden.

I took off my underwear which already had a tent and showed my erect cock in front of Odie's eyes.

As she looked at me, my cock began to leak precum, as if it was dreaming of the action to come.

"Please sit here, young master."

"Hmm?　Oh."

Odie stands up in her underwear, a gray camisole and ivory drawers.

I was tempted to look at her ample bosom and suck on it, but I did as she asked and sat down on the seat.

I'm a little embarrassed to say that my erect penis is peeking out from between my arranged legs, asserting itself.

"Mmm, you're very healthy."

Then Odie knelt down on the floor instead of the seat and touched both my knees.

I could feel that she was putting a lot of effort to open my legs, so I gladly spread them.

"If you don't mind, young master, ......"

Odie then moved her index finger and placed it on her lips. She was going to caress me with her mouth, in other words, give me a blowjob.

I've been playing this nice, pleasant but embarrassing game of sucking on Odie's chest while she's on her knees and squeezing me with her hand and ejaculating on her for days, but it looks like he won't be doing it today.

Come to think of it, the carriage isn't as easy to clean as the bedroom. Odie would probably have a hard time cleaning up after her if she gave him a hand job as usual and shot him to the heavens with all her might.

It was a shame that I didn't get a hand job, but it was actually my first blowjob by Odie, so I wasn't complaining.

I had been sucked clean after sex was completely over, but I had never been sucked as a caress.

Even Minith's blowjob, which I had only been lightly instructed in by the head maid, gave me such pleasure that my brain went numb. Just imagining the skill of Odie, who had the head maid as her mother and was married with a husband, made my penis quiver.

"I don't mind. It makes me very happy."

Odie giggled and took the root of the rod in her hand as she wiggled it up and down with a little effort between her legs.

She then moved in between my legs with a cat's paw motion. The familiarity of her movements is very encouraging.

"Chuu♡"

Odie's wet lips touched the tip of the glans.

My penis was instantly tinged with excitement as it received a sweet kiss, similar to a kiss on a beloved object.

"Chu...... nub, chu...... buchu...... ♡ Churu...... chu......."

Odie's tongue crawled slowly, impatiently, and she made sounds with her lips as if to provoke me.

She looked up at me with troubled, upturned eyes and occasionally combed her drooping bangs to the side with a hand comb.

The way she combed her red hair was so sexy that I wanted to skip the foreplay and just insert her into my vagina.

"Oh ...... ugh ...... oh, Odie, there, there, ahhh... good..."

"Fumo♡ Mmmm... fuuu... ...... mmmm... ......"

The flesh of Odie's mouth enveloped my penis to its fullest extent.

The embrace of the flesh, which was initially limited to the tip of the glans, gradually enveloped the rod and eventually reached the base.

The tongue on the underside of my penis ripples rhythmically as if to match the arousal of my penis, which rapidly increases its hardness.

"Ah, ah, also ...... a little more, slowly, Odie ....... Ugh, Odie ......."

I wanted to soak up more of her warm, inviting mouth. That was the cry from my penis.

The movement of her tongue was gentle and compassionate, accepting all of my meat stick.

I could be sure that if I let her go, she would accept everything I had to offer.

"Hmm.. Alright ...Hmm...Hmm...♡"

I wanted to ejaculate and be accepted, but I also wanted to be surrounded by these caresses.

The two conflicting desires began to fight in my brain, and before I knew it, I was slobbering noisily.

"Aaah ...... ugh ...... ♡"

"Mubu...... chu...... ♡ Churu...... leh...... mmm...... jubu......"

The relentless movement of her tongue as if she was scraping off the grime that had accumulated between the glans and the rod brought me intense pleasure and at the same time brought out my shame.

I hadn't soaked in the bathtub for several days and had only wiped my body with a cloth, so it was embarrassing to have my genitals licked so carefully.

Just the thought of her working so hard to clean up my dirty dick makes me feel irresistible.

"Mmm, Juju. ...... Pfft!　You can take it out just like that, young master. ...... Amumu♡"

I had only suppressed my ejaculation to enjoy more of this pleasure, but Odie may have decided that I was refraining from oral ejaculation.

She took her mouth off my cock for a moment, and then she sucked my cock into her mouth again, changing her movements from caressing it with her tongue and the walls of her mouth to a pistoning motion using her entire mouth.

The back and forth motion, the tongue flicking from side to side, and the lustrous breathing of Odie as she moved her head back and forth. Odie's breathing becomes more and more intense as she moves her head back and forth, and my penis instantly starts to make noise.

"Ugh, ...... is, oh, oh, it's about to come out ......."

"Mmm ♡, Mmm ♡, Mmm ♡"

Sensing that I had reached my limit, Odie sped up her pistoning and put her hands around my waist.

It was a silent declaration that she was going to drink up every drop of my semen.

I bent forward to hold the back of her head and released all the desire I had been holding in.



"Odie..... I'm cumming,  I'm cumming ♡ !　Ugh!"

"Mmm!"

"Hugh! It's coming!"

I unleash my seed on Odie, who is buried in my lower abdomen and all I can see is the back of her head.

My hands were still holding her head, and she was still taking in my semen.

"Oh, oh...... Odie, Odie, Odie...... ooh......."

The sound and vibration of Odie swallowing semen is transmitted through my penis.

The fact that she was swallowing semen tickled my sexual senses to a good degree, and my ejaculation continued in small increments.

I was intoxicated by Odie's receptiveness, and I was squeezed to my limit.

"Haa...... haa...... haa......."

Odie didn't take her mouth off my cock until I had finished cumming.

I felt her tongue gently stroke the sensitive glans after she had spit out my semen. I felt like I was stroking the head of a small child. I felt like I was being complimented on my ability to ejaculate so much.

I took Odie's hand which was lying round my waist and pulled her back a little.

"...... That was amazing."

Odie looked up and wiped the mixture of saliva and semen from her mouth with her finger.

I don't know what was so great, but I'm sure it was the force or the amount.

Ever since he learned to have sex with a woman, this young body has been producing semen like an industrial revolution.

"Odie was very good, too. I'm glad you drank my ...... stuff."

"You've given me a lot...♡"

I held my hands out towards Odie, asserting with my body language that I wanted to hug her.

I grabbed her wrist and forced her to sit beside me and hugged her body.

The pungent smell of cum hit my nose, but I was satisfied enough to ignore it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 121 - Eating my sister servant who gently takes care of my sexual needs (2/2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Odie picked up the jug provided in the carriage and took a few sips of water.

I watched her as I was exposing my wilting cock.

"Now I want to put it in here."

"What?　Oh, ......♡"

Then I touched her genitals over her underwear. I was in a sexual harassment mood.

Odie was surprised, perhaps because she didn't expect to have sex in a carriage, or perhaps because she thought that the amount of cum I had just produced would exhaust me.

But as far as I was concerned, there was no way I could hold back with just oral ejaculation. Sex is only as good as the seed it produces.

I beckoned Odie, who was trying to fix her messy camisole, to sit next to me.

Sliding one hand down her ample chest, I kissed her on the mouth.

"...... chu♡"

"Ahh ...... chu♡"

The faint smell of cum didn't smell particularly good ......, but I enjoyed the softness of Odie's lips regardless.

I focused on kissing Odie as much as possible.

"Chu...Ody, I love you...♡"

"Young master...♡"

I felt her tongue was stickier than before, but I decided not to think about why.

I let go of her lips and ran my tongue down her slightly sweaty neck.

"Oh ...... ♡ Mmm......"

"We have plenty of time, let's take our time and enjoy it."

My erect cock was already 80% recovered from the kiss.

There was nothing to do but fuck during the trip anyway. I want to enjoy Odie's body to the fullest.

"I think I'm ready for ......."

She wanted to put her hand inside her underwear to caress it, but her secret places were already wet.

I still hadn't laid eyes on Odie's genitals, but I was accustomed to touching them in the past few days of sex.

"Young master, please don't say things like that ......"

Odie turned her face down in shame and put her arms around my head and hugged me to her chest.

While buried in her soft and warm breasts, I continued to caress her genitals with my fingers.

"Young master..."

The love juices were spread out enough so that my fingers could easily enter the vagina.

My crotch hardened at the thought that it was going to be my dick, not my finger, that was going to be wrapped around her. No matter how many times I experience this, I never get tired of it.

"Odie, please."

With my face buried in her chest, I looked up at her and asked her to insert me.

I would have liked to pull down her underwear and thrust her as hard as I could, but Odie didn't want to do that because it would have exposed her vagina.

She would show it to me if I asked her to, but I don't think she would want to. I don't want to do anything she doesn't want to do because I want to have a sweet, fun and pleasant mating.

"Well, ...... I'm already this hard ......."

Odie touched my penis with her fingers to check the hardness. It wasn't the hardest yet, but it would hold up to penetration.

As I was thinking about what position to put her in, Odie put her palms on my thighs.

"May I?"

"Yes."

As soon as I said yes, Odie straddled my thighs. It was a face-to-face sitting position.

Even though we were face to face, Odie was taller than me, so it was her tits that came in front of me. She was still wearing a camisole, so I couldn't see her tits.

"Oh... young master..."

Odie was wriggling to pull down her underwear, but stopped when she realized I was staring at it.

I had a chance to sneak a peek at Odie's vagina, but it didn't happen.

"Oh, young master. You'll have to stay here until I finish taking off my ...... clothes."

With that, Odie picked up the hem of her camisole and pulled it up. This revealed, of course, Odie's raw breasts.

Just as she wanted, I was drawn like a moth to a light and put my lips on the tip of her breast.

I found myself sucking on Odie's nipple with a chuckling sound, as natural as a baby asking for milk.

"Chuu ......♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"

"Really ......♡ You like tits, don't you, young master?"

You can't help but suck on them when they pop out in front of you, it's the nature of men.

She finished taking off her underwear while I was engrossed in kneading her nipples, and she adjusted her position.

"I'm coming in, young master"

I felt something soft touch the tip of my meat stick.

It was probably Odie's cunt.

I stared silently at Odie and nodded slowly.

"Ohh. ......"

Slowly, Odie's hips lowered, and at the same time, the tip of my penis received an irresistible stimulation.

The pleasure was getting closer and closer to the base, with a little up and down along the way.

Odie settled back down and brought her face closer to mine.

I immediately accepted it and kissed her, stretching my neck up a little.

The sweet kiss, which drips saliva onto me, makes my penis even harder.

"Chu ....... Odie, don't move. I want to stay connected with you."

"Mmm, I understand ♡"

I could have enjoyed shaking my hips violently, but I wanted to taste Odie's vagina slowly and without moving.

She stiffened in the face-to-face position and I asked her to kiss me again and again.

We kissed deeply, nipping at each other's tongues, and then we kissed shallowly, bouncing our lips together and letting the saliva pour into our mouths.

Each time he called her name and kissed her, her vagina would contract slightly, inviting his penis to ejaculate. I suppressed the urge to move my hips in response to her invitation.

"Haa...... haa...... ♡ little boy...... mmm...... ♡ ah...... ugh......"

Odie was sitting with her legs open, so her cunt was in an easy position for me to knead with my fingers.

I continued to stimulate her clitoris with my fingers during our kiss, enjoying the caress.

"Nnngh ♡"

Her genitals were shamelessly dripping with love juice, responding to my assault.

Her face was slightly red with shame as she looked down at me with puffy eyes.

"Ah... young master..."

"Chuu♡"

When I kissed her on the mouth, Odie's tongue movements became more and more intense and powerful.

She must have been getting excited herself, because she was almost sucking up my saliva.

When I changed the rhythm of the clitoral stimulation, she seemed to be surprised by the change, and her vagina tightened up on my rod.

"Aah♡♡♡♡!"

"I'm going to cum, Odie. ......!

Even though I wasn't moving my hips at all, I was about to climax just by being connected to her.

I wanted to ejaculate right now, to fill her vagina with me.

I put my hands around her waist and positioned myself for ejaculation.

"Young master. Please cum anytime. I'll take it all in."

"Odie ......"

"Please let it all out."

Odie hugged me and patted me on the back as if she was nursing a child.

I think it triggered me, and I came.

"Ooooh!　Odie!　Ooh!"

It was not as good as the first shot.

It wasn't as strong as the first shot, but I felt enough force to make sure it reached the back of her vagina.

I lifted up her camisole and took her nipple into my mouth, breathing hard as I did so, and I shot the rest of my semen as well.

"Ugh ...... ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"

"Oh, ...... young master, there it is, yes, good boy ♡"

"Odie, more."

"Mmm. You're a good boy, little boy ♡ You've got a lot of cum, that's nice ♡"

Odie's voice sounded like she was praising a child, and I felt my heart melt with pleasure as I sought her out, not caring about her physical appearance.

My cock seemed to take advantage of this, and continued to ejaculate in small spurts.

I breathed hard again, imagining the semen sticking to her vaginal walls.

"Chū ♡ Huh ...... Huh"

"Nn...... chu♡"

After a long exchange of kisses, Odie seemed to decide that I was done cumming.

I held her shoulders as she tried to climb down on my thighs, and I opened my mouth.

"...... Odie, wait."

"You want me to stay like this?"

My penis is still stuck in Odie's vagina, though it has become squishy. If I pull out now, the semen is going to spill out.

I wonder if it is a man's instinct to impregnate a woman that makes him want to stay connected and plug her vagina.

"Yes, it is. I want to stay connected to Odie. Don't you......?"

Odie didn't reply to my question, but instead responded with a gentle pat on my back.

I hugged her tightly and just wished her good luck with my sperm.

Chapter 122 - Mixed Bathing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mount Erechtheion, the highest mountain on the continent.

This mountain, revered as the "Mountain of the North" by the people of Oldentse, is generally considered not to be a volcano.

There is no evidence of an eruption in the literature, and there are no legends of eruptions in the folklore at the foot of the mountain.

However, what I have been able to find in the literature is within the range of a few hundred years at most. It is quite possible that the volcano has been erupting repeatedly for thousands of years.

Unfortunately, I have very little knowledge about geology. My knowledge of geology was at the level of elementary school science; if I saw a layer of volcanic ash in the ground, I knew that there had been an eruption in the past.

While I was thinking about this as I looked at my penis, which had become an extinct volcano after the act with Odie, the carriage quietly came to a stop.

The area around where we are currently traveling by carriage can be described as the edge of the Kieborg Mountains, which make up Mount Erechtheion.

The land has many gentle slopes, but occasionally there are steep slopes or uneven roads that force the carriage to change direction.

If it was only a horse and a human being strengthened with magic power, it would be possible to pass through, but if you are pulling a carriage, it is a different story.

Just as I was about to take a look out the window, there was a knock on the carriage door. Judging from the way it was knocking, it must have been Tesh.

"The young master will have to wait."

"Got it."

Quickly adjusting her camisole and putting on her underwear, Odie poked her head out of the small window of the carriage and started talking with Tesh.

As expected, it would be suicide to attack a carriage ridden by a nobleman, so it was probably not a bandit attack.

Even if they did, they would be processed into meat immediately because my guards would be riding around the carriage on alert.

Apparently it was nothing too serious, and Odie quickly ended the conversation and turned back to us.

"I heard that there is a hot spring near here. Why don't you stop by and take a bath?"

According to what Odie had heard from Tesh, there was a village around here that used naturally occurring hot springs as a common bathing place.

Since I wanted to use the hot water to wash away the stickiness after sex, it was a good idea.

Tesh must have known that Odie and I were having intercourse together and that I would want to take a bath afterwards, so he was very considerate.

"That's good. I was just about to take a bath. Tell Tesh to get on with it."

Odie peeked out the window again to give his message, and soon the carriage was moving.

The hot spring village was about half an hour ahead of us in the other direction.

The scene of many small houses with thatched roofs, a country village at the foot of the mountains, was a perfect match. It looked like something out of a Japanese folk tale.

I guess they didn't expect the aristocrats to come this deep into the mountains, and at a break in the wooden fence that seemed to be the entrance to the village, a few villagers greeted them, posing as if they were crawling on the ground.

The old woman that looked so afraid was the chief of the hot spring village.

"Young master."

"Mmm."

With a look of dignity on my face, I handed Tesh several dozen silver coins.

As a nobleman, I can't hand money directly to the villagers, so I handed it to Tesh.

"Oh, my God!　Thank you, thank you, thank you ......!"

The old woman shuddered and bowed her head, apparently not expecting to be paid just for temporarily renting out the hot spring.

The silver coin I had been given was worth a decent amount of money, but from my point of view, it wasn't much.

It's a good idea to give a little bit of money to the soldiers and city officials when you return to Nambonan City.

I'd like to see the village of Hot Springs use it as a negative campaign against the current emperor of the Jinkaen Empire. I'm sure there will be vendors stopping by here, and I hope they can spread the word.

Led by the young villagers kneeling with the old woman, the carriage headed for the hot springs.

The hot spring was located at the back of the village, and seemed to be surrounded by a blindfold of sycamore. I decided to open the door of the carriage to get a closer look at the outside.

"I apologize for such a shabby place. ......"

What I found was an open-air bath with a circular border made of rocks.

The baths are about the size of a baseball diamond and are filled with milky white water.

"...... What is this dirty water?　Are you planning to bathe the young master here?"

One of my guards said to the young men in the village in a stern tone.

The young men, probably frightened by the way the guards were talking, began to make hasty excuses, but they had no idea what they were talking about.

Tesh, unable to see this, stepped forward and opened his mouth.

"I've heard that some hot springs have white water."

"Y-yes, that's right!"

The young people thanked Tesh for coming to their aid and continued to affirm his words.

The guards seemed to think that if Tesh was telling the truth, then there was no doubt about it, and quickly stepped back.

"It is said to be poor, but it is a good hot spring. It has a certain charm to it."

"Y-yes!"

The young man screamed like a girl and bowed his head, even though I had just given him a compliment.

If I were an aristocrat with a temper tantrum, the hot water would turn from white to red.

I got off the carriage, ignoring the young people, and looked around the hot spring.

It was very similar to the open-air baths of my previous life in Japan, which made me feel a little sentimental.

When I turned around to take a quick soak, I saw the old woman, the village chief, sitting some of her daughters on the ground.

She said, "I have gathered all the girls who wish to help the nobleman bathe. ......

She was so shaken when she greeted me, but when she found out that I was a young man of nobility, she immediately prepared the village girls.

"It's a nice spa."

"Oh."

I decided to join Odie in the hot springs.

Unfortunately, the village girls the old woman had prepared for us did not come for the purpose of pleasing me.

So I sent the girls back and asked Odie to take the bath.

Normally, it would be impossible for a servant to bathe in the same water as his master, but I convinced her that it was part of the sex time.

It was all about my selfishness of wanting to take a bath with a girl.

The milky white water obscured more than half of Odie's body, but I was very satisfied.

I wish we had a hot spring near New Nellie City.

Soaking in a hot spring under the clear blue winter sky gives me a different kind of euphoria than sex.

It had been a long time since I had taken a bath, and the fatigue seemed to seep out of my body and flow away.

If there was a hot spring near New Nellie City, I would invite Fanny to take a bath. I'm sure she'll be delighted, as she loves bathing, just like me.

She might say something cute like, "Thank you for inviting me, brother, but since we're going out of our way, let's go to the hot spring together.

I heard that there are several natural hot springs in this area, but unfortunately I had never heard of any similar ones in the vicinity of New Nellie City.

As expected, we can't bring Fanny this far.

"It's polluted now. It's a shame."

Odie was giving me a talking-to, but I couldn't quite make sense of the line.

"Polluted?"

"Didn't you know about ......?　I heard that there used to be hot springs in the interior."

The "interior" refers to the territory between the two major rivers in the Quadrant.

In short, the area where New Nellie City, Gatoren City, and Evermill City are located can be called the main part of the Quardenze territory.

On the other hand, the territory beyond the Okawa River to the west is called Gaichi.

These are the new territories that my grandfather had seized in the war, and they refer to the place where this hot spring village and Nambonan City are located.

"Hot springs in the mainland? I've never heard of it. ......"

"I see. I heard that it was located straight northwest from New Nellie City. I only heard about it from my maternal grandfather, so I don't know much about it.

Without even having a map in my mind, I had an idea of where it was.

If you go northwest from New Nellie City, you'll hit a big river, but before that, there's a lot of polluted land.

About a hundred years ago, a mature magical beast had wreaked havoc in the territory of Quardenze.

It was too late to rush to the scene, and by the time the nobles of the Quardenze family had defeated the beast, the pollution had spread.

The land where there used to be a small town is still polluted 100 years later, and remains as a negative legacy of the Quardenze territory.

It is said that this mature magical beast originated in the territory of the Kingdom of Voistra, and crossed the great river to the east to come to the territory of Quardenze.

This is an example of a neighboring territory's mismanagement causing trouble for others.

"I see. I would like to visit there one day when the land is clean again."

"Yes."

If Odie was right, there were probably hot springs in that polluted land.

I think I would get sick if I took a bath in a hot spring that comes from a land that has been polluted by mature magical beasts. I have no choice but to give up.

"...... It's nice to take a hot spring bath with Odie like this."

I hugged Odie from behind and rubbed her arms and legs.

The only thing we talked about while we were doing this was intercourse. As if suddenly remembering, Odie said, "Your semen is so wonderful."

"The young master's seed was so amazing. I was almost gagging."

I think that's what she said when she drank the semen he had ejaculated in her mouth.

I thought it must have been the force or the volume or the taste, but I was wrong.

"Yes. I didn't expect to be able to feel such a strong magical power.

"Magic power? Not because of the power or quantity?

"Magic. It was incredibly dense. I've seen ...... power and quantity many times.

Well, come to think of it, my first sexual act with Odie was a hand job. She seemed to have gotten a good grasp of the power and volume.

I felt like I was being taken advantage of, so I decided to ask her a few teasing questions.

"Hmmm. Was it thicker than ...... your husband's?"

"...... Yes. I've never had anything as thick as that before."

I was a little flattered, as I felt as if I was being complimented on the thickness of my semen.

Odie's husband is a cousin. The difference between my magic power and that of the main ancestor is probably an order of magnitude greater. And since I have an unusually large amount of magic power, the thickness of the semen must be different.

When I thought about it, when I forced Lupetta to drink her semen, she gagged to the point of vomiting.

That was probably because it was her first time someone ejaculated in her mouth, but maybe she was just surprised by the amount of magical power.

The only people I've ever had sex with who had magical powers were Lupetta and Odie, except for Eve who had a magical seal on her. It may be that people who are slaves cannot feel magic power.

After I finished rubbing Odie's legs, waist and arms, I finally put my hands on her breasts.

"...... They're soft and fluffy. It's not like touching them in bed."

It's the first time I've ever experienced the feel of breasts swaying with the buoyancy of water.

Unlike the usual firm boobs, the boobs in the bath are soft and fluffy, and if you touch them, you can feel them swaying.

It is a fuzzy feeling, but the feeling of the bath was very nice.

"Do you often touch other women's breasts as well, young master?"

"It can't be helped."

I won't deny it.

Even if it is Lupetta who has small tits, I will still rub and suck her chest.

"You can't touch ...... Minith's breasts for a while, okay?"

According to Odie, it's not a good idea to sexually stimulate a pregnant woman.

Minith hadn't been confirmed yet in her alleged pregnancy, but she said it was better not to touch them in the early stages of pregnancy, just in case it was an important time.

It seems that my love for breasts has been judged to be considerable, as she went out of her way to give me a hard time.

All right. Let me know if there's anything else I should be aware of.

When I said that, Odie gave me a list of things to look out for in pregnant women. I memorized each of them.

I would be impregnating a lot of girls from now on, so there was no harm in knowing them.

In this way, the fun mixed bathing time after sex turned into sex education in the true sense of the word.

Chapter 123 - Holy City
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Zesu Sect Holy High Society is an organization created by the founder Zesu.

Its purpose is to spread the teachings of Zesuism to the people and protect the land from maturing demonic beasts, so it is said that it has had a strong role as a ruler since its establishment.

Hundreds of years later, it is still a nation with its own territory and army. However, it has fallen far short of its heyday.

The political and economic center of Saint Navenpos, the once glorious holy city of Maguaose, was drizzling that day.

"Huh. ......"

In the anteroom of the Colpa Cathedral, a priest sighed.

The rain clouds outside the window were as dim as his heart.

"Priest Lante. You're sighing again."

The man called Lante replied, making no attempt to hide his annoyance at the priest who had warned him.

"I don't blame you. The mere thought of attending a saint's meeting makes my hands shake, so shut up and listen to me sigh."

"Isn't it a proud thing for a priest to be able to attend the Congregation for the Causes of Saints? I envy you."

In response to the priest's light-hearted remark, Lante pinched his own priestly garment between his fingers and flicked it around.

It was an unadorned garment that indicated the status of a lowly priest.

"If you want, you can take over. Wouldn't it be nice to sit at a round table with all the high priestly dignitaries?"

"Please don't. I'm more than nervous enough just being in this waiting room.

After that, Lante became silent with a sullen expression on his face.

The other priests in the anteroom understood how Lante felt, so they decided not to say anything else.

Tapping his fingers on the desk, Lante looks out the window and waits for the call with a sigh.

As the drizzle turned into a real downpour, there was a knock on the door of the waiting room.

"Thank you for your patience. Priest Lante, Priestess Renessa is waiting for you.

When Lante opened the door, it was his colleague, the priest, who was standing there.

As he led the way out of the corridor, he found an elderly woman waiting for him, dressed in a priestly uniform that was far more opulent than that of the lowly priest.

"I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Priest Lante. Are you ready?"

"Yes."

Lante shakes off his nervousness and anxiety as he speaks.

When Renessa saw him, she smiled benevolently.

"You don't have to be nervous like that. I chose you to be my assistant because I judged that I needed you."

The Congregation of Saints, consisting of the Pope and nineteen supreme priests, was the apex of St. Navenpos's power.

The supreme priest was allowed to have one priest as his assistant, but a high priest was customarily chosen.

The term "high priest" does not refer to a specific position, but is a general term for all priests belonging to the Patriarch. In the same way, a low priest is a priest who belongs to the ancestor.

"But I am a lowly priest. ......"

"If you are concerned about such practices, you will not be able to move forward. Priest Lante, you know it well, don't you?"

As a subordinate of Renessa's, Lante is involved in the administration of the territory, reorganizing and reforming to break down vested interests.

However, in the corner of his mind, he thought that the custom of limiting the attendance of high priests at the saints' meetings was one of the customs that should be protected.

The high priests are the power and the key to protect St. Navenpos from the threats of the Levios Kingdom, not to mention the maturing demonic beasts.

It seemed like an act of disrespect to all the high priests for a lowly priest to attend a meeting of saints who were directly involved in the running of St. Navenpos.

Even if Renessa, one of the highest priests, allowed it, it was impossible to predict what the Pope and the other highest priests would think or do.

The worst that could happen is that the matter would be brought to the fore and Renessa would be forced to leave the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.

"Has the ...... Priest Lante heard of today's agenda?"

"No, nothing yet. Does Priestess Renessa know about it?"

Renessa took a step closer to Lante, her eyebrows furrowed as she surveyed her surroundings.

Judging from the look on her face that this was a serious matter, Lante approached her with her head at Renessa's height and waited for her to speak.

"It looks like we're going to war with the Kingdom of Levios."

Before Lante could react, Renessa gestured with her finger, "Quiet.

Fortunately, Lante did not have the temperament to raise his voice carelessly. No one would have noticed the change if they hadn't seen his tense expression.

"Is it true, ......?"

"To find out, I would like you to assist me."

In the event that St. Navenpos and the Kingdom of Levios were to go to war, Lante began to run a number of simulations in his mind as to how he should act.

When Renessa saw the change in Lante's expression, she smiled with relief. There was the talented politician she had come to rely on as her one-armed friend.

"You've become a reliable face. I'm counting on you, Priest Lante."

With Lante nodding silently, Renessa began to walk down the corridor.

The meeting of the saints is held in the Holy Room, the innermost room of the Colpa Cathedral.

It is a sanctuary that not only ordinary believers and priests, but even high-ranking priests are not allowed to enter, unless they are from a very prominent family.

The sanctuary, which is said to be the room that Zesu, the founder of the church, used to pray in, was filled with a heavy atmosphere.

The presence of Lante, a lowly priest, was not well received by the other high priests, but their complaints were suppressed when the Pope accepted Renessa's word that there was no problem with the regulations.

"I will now hold an emergency meeting of the saints. Prayers and vows, each of you."

Since there is no hierarchy of supreme priests, the presiding role is rotational. This time it was Renessa who presided.

The meeting of the saints opened with the Pope, the supreme priest, the priests who assisted him, and several clerks and other administrative staff.

"First of all, let me ask you something. Is it true that you launched a massive indiscriminate attack in the Kingdom of Levios that failed?"

It was not the hostess, Renessa, who spoke first, but the middle-aged, bald-headed high priest.

He had a short temper and usually tended to ignore the moderator, but this time there was no one to blame. Everyone wanted to know the answer to his question.

"May I make a statement?"

The elderly high priest slowly lifted his palm, which was crisscrossed with blood vessels.

On the right half of his bearded face, a scar that looked as if it had been burned red stood out. It was a scar of honor from a battle with a mature magical beast.

He had been known as a martial artist in the past, and his body now looked well-trained and toned.

"Please. High Priest Terotris."

High Priest Terotris is one of the most outspoken priests in St. Navenpos.

The nineteen High Priests who attend the Congregation of Saints have formed several factions, one of which is the Terovolas faction.

One of the factions is the Terrorists, a faction that is willing to use violent means to revive the Society of the Holy High Priest. They are the extremists of the extremists.

"I would hate to be accused of having failed."

In an old man's voice, moderately hushed and low-pitched, Terotris continued.

"We have been forced into a situation where we must fail. I'm sure those of you sitting over there are well aware of that."

Making no attempt to hide his sarcasm, Terotris turned his palms to the other side of the round table and said.

"What do you mean?　The reason for this in the first place, Priestess Terotris!　It's probably because of the plan that you guys dictated!　Do you know how much more vigilant King's Landing has become because of that?

The Supreme Priest, who had his palms turned towards Terotris, who showed a fearless smile, turned red and protested. I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea.

When Lante thought that the discussion was about to turn into a shouting match, the moderator, Renessa, interrupted it.

"Silence. ...... Priestess Terotris. Can you begin by telling us what happened so that all of us here can understand?"

"Yes, miss."

After receiving the nomination from Renessa, Terotris stood up and looked at everyone sitting at the round table.

When his eyes met those red-black eyes, Lante felt a cold sweat break out on his back. It was as if he was looking at something dirty, a gaze that could only bring him shame.

I'll start with the conclusion. My subordinates have carried out a random attack. The location is New Nellie City in the Quadrant.

The words caused an uproar in the Holy Room.

"Why, of all places, New Nellie City?" Lante felt like slamming the desk.

And that seemed to be the feeling of most of the people present, as one of the high priests threw his words in anger.

One of the high priests said angrily, "Why did you provoke the Quardenze family?　Priest Terotris!　This is a serious matter!

Seeing the High Priest raising his voice, Lante inwardly cheered, "Good, say more.

The Quardenze family has not destroyed the Holy High Church despite being in the Kingdom of Levios.

Their collaboration with St. Navenpos is monitored and there are many restrictions on their activities, but they are still allowed to worship in New Nelly City.

There are a few moderate high priests who are considering reconciliation with the Kingdom of Levios, but they envisioned negotiations through the Quardenze family.

Even if they did not proceed with the reconciliation, there was no merit in making enemies of the Quardenze family, which was not strongly oppressive against the Holy High Society.

"Silence. Continue."

Renessa did her job as a moderator again and returned the control of the conversation to Terotris.

"We must start with the beginning. The first time this happened, I don't know how many years ago, a boy was born blessed by a spirit in a farming village near New Nellie City. The parents of the baby boy were devout members of the Holy High Society."

Even if it is just a commoner, a child of two slave ancestors, a person who belongs to the main ancestor can be born in very rare cases.

This is called a child blessed by the spirits, but in the Kingdom of Levios and the Jinkaen Empire, it is separated from its parents in the hunt for the main ancestor by the nobles.

As a rule, they are executed if they are boys, and if they are girls, they are often raised as mothers who bear children.

The parents, who did not want their child to be killed by the Quardenze family, consulted the church in New Nellie City. So we decided to raise the boy in secrecy from the Quardenze family.

It was only natural that the parents would try to hide the child, as a boy was certain to be executed.

But it was not something that could be easily hidden. As if he had read Lante's thoughts, Terotris continued his story.

The place where it was hidden was the field. Fortunately, there was a large field in New Nellie City.

The field is a perfect place to hide the baby of the main ancestor, since it is difficult for detection magic to work inside the field.

"I've heard that even babies can destroy leeches with just their natural magic power if they are the main ancestor. On the contrary, I would like to report that research has shown that leeches are no longer generated in an area the size of this room."

Lante understood the troublesome nature of leeches in the field, as he had once entered the field to exterminate magical beasts.

He thought that it would be quite convenient if he could just take one of the main ancestors into the field and not have to worry about leeches.

However, it was not in his power to take a high priest into the field.

"The environment for the child's upbringing was set up with the help of the local church leader. The environment for the child's upbringing was provided by the local churchwarden, and food was brought in mainly by adventurers, but I don't know much about that."

Adventurers spend several days or weeks in the field, so it was not unnatural for them to have a large supply of food.

The local church leader seemed to be a smart man in his own right, Lante thought.

"The reason we raised the boys, to create an army. Once the Blessed Child had reached sentience, we planned to bring in cheap slave girls to increase our numbers in the field. It would be just the thing for the incisive force of the coming days."

Terotris insists that we must fight the Kingdom of Levios decisively. The "coming day" he was referring to was the day of war with the Kingdom of Levios.

If the Kingdom of Levios and St. Navenpos were to go to war as he said, the Quardenze family would also join the war. If that happened, their home city of New Nellie would be stretched thin.

So what would happen if a special squad of followers led by the main ancestor suddenly popped up from the field?

It would be able to inflict a great deal of damage on the Quardenze family, who would be hit in the side.

Lante thought that what Terotris said made sense, regardless of whether it was right or wrong.

"In other words, we did not intend to carry out the same indiscriminate attack plan in the Quardenze territory as before. We intended to use the Blessed Child as a stallion. In fact, I've received reports that we were able to impregnate several of them."

Lante looked at Terotris's face.

He had the look of a man who was convinced that nothing he had done was wrong.

"However, our plan has been ruined. I believe there were some who failed to make it to King's Landing, and thanks to them, some of our movements were leaked."

When referring to those who failed in their efforts in King's Landing, Terotris glanced at a few of the high priests.

The irritated tone of voice that said it was your fault must have come from the heart.

Unfortunately, the only ones in the field were the Blessed Child and a newborn baby. It's no wonder he chose to strike a blow against the tyranny of the nobles rather than flee with them. My comrade Diana has carried out an indiscriminate attack by a mature magical beast."

Lante knew the name of the low-ranking priestess Diana.

Diana was a direct subordinate of Terotris, a female priest with a strong radical ideology. It would not be surprising if she launched an indiscriminate attack, as Terotris had suggested.

The details are still unknown, but a mature magical beast was born and attacked New Nelly City.

Once again, the Holy Chamber becomes noisy.

Everyone understood that a mature demonic beast jumping out of a field the size of New Nellie Field would be a once-in-a-century disaster.

They all waited for Terotris to continue, wondering how much land had been contaminated and in which direction the mature demonic beast that had destroyed New Nellie City was headed.

Lante also narrowed his eyes as he thought about what to do.

If a mature demonic beast were to move south, it would cause a great deal of trouble for the city-states that had established friendly relations with St. Navenpos.

And if this plot were to be leaked, it would lead to a serious deterioration in relations.

"......, by the way. The mature demonic beast was apparently defeated overnight. By the Quardenze family."

The face of Terotris, who said it as if he were spitting it out, was heartbreakingly bitter.

It was not only Lante who felt the concentrated outpouring of rage, like sludge spewed from the depths of his throat.

Everyone in attendance gasped at the sight, and for a moment the holy room was silent.

"...... Wait. I'm not sure if it's possible to defeat a mature demonic beast of the scale of New Nellie in one night?　This is the first time I've seen such a thing. I've never heard of any heroism against a mature demonic beast before."

The question that everyone felt was voiced by one of the High Priests.

After the silence was broken, the other high priests began to voice their doubts one after another.

Is it really a magical beast that was born in New Nellie Field?　Could they be mistakenly thinking that it was born in a smaller field?

"No, it's likely that Galfis was staying in New Nelly City. It makes sense if you consider that the one night was just a rumor and they actually fought for several days."

"Isn't it normal to think that Galfis is on the front lines against the Empire?　Considering the current composition of the Quardenze family, it is reasonable to place Galfis in the west."

"It's probably just that their military prowess wasn't widespread and they had power in their own generation. It's no wonder he has the blood of the Five Lords Princess and the Red Devil in his veins.

As speculation spread everywhere, Renessa turned her gaze to Lante.

"What do you think Priest Lante?"

"I......"

The moment Lante was about to speak his thoughts, Terotris lightly poked the desk and then answered his question.

"It was the legitimate son of the Quardenze family, Quardenze Wilk, who took the fall. I've received reports that a festival was held in his name in New Nellie City."

Even the High Priest does not know the name of the child of a noble family.

Terotris looked at the Supreme Priests, who were not responding well, and began to tell them information about the vanquisher, as if he had no choice.

"It seems that the priest Lante already knew."

-Seeing that Lante was listening to her only for confirmation, Renessa said quietly. Lante immediately affirmed it.

"Yes. Recently, some of us have become obsessed with Quardenze, and I naturally became familiar with it.

"So ...... I'd like to have a little chat with you when the meeting is over. The fact that a mature magical beast was defeated in a single night raises eyebrows, but I am concerned about the fact that the head of the Quardenze family is trying to spread the name of his son. I'm sure they have some sort of agenda, since the Quardenze are schemers."

Terotris's explanation was over while Lante and Renessa were whispering.

After looking around at everyone for the last time, Terotris begins to conclude his story.

"There's one last thing I want to say. Diana sent me a letter before she went ahead with her plan. This letter."

Then he took out a letter and flicked it around.

"It says that the indiscriminate attack will be carried out after all conclusive evidence has been destroyed. We'll just have to go through with it."

No matter how much the low priests said they would dispose of the evidence, the high priests could not be trusted.

In their eyes, Diana was just a feeble being with the magical power of a follower.

"What would happen if Priestess Diana was captured by the Quardenze family?　Wouldn't she tell them everything?"

Terotris glared at the High Priestess, who had interjected from the side.

"First, sacrifice the captured adventurers, then the hired mercenaries, then the babies that the Blessed Child has given birth to, and if the magical beast does not mature with that, Diana will offer herself, and finally the Blessed Child will jump in. ...... This is the indiscriminate attack plan that was written in the letter."

Lante felt his skin crawl with fear at the spirit of this man who was willing to sacrifice his own body to carry out the plan.

The Blessed Child was also educated in the ideology of the extremists, so he would have no doubts about being sacrificed.

The distortions of the extremists and the terrorists made Lante feel fearful even after all this time.

"The demonic beasts won't mature in the New Nellie Field if we take in a few ...... squires. I believe that taking in the Blessed Child probably completed the maturing of the demonic beasts. Considering the order of events, Diana is most likely already dead."

The tone of Terotris's voice dropped, and as soon as he finished, he prayed to the spirits. It was a requiem prayer for Diana, the lowly priestess.

With his eyes closed, Terotris said: "Even if she caught, there is no problem. Diana will not succumb to the torture of the nobles."

This confident statement resonated well in the quiet sanctuary.

After the meeting of the saints was closed, Lante and Renessa returned to the waiting room and let out a sigh together.

It had only been about 20 days since the indiscriminate attack by the mature magical beasts in New Nellie City.

At the moment, they could only trust what Terotris, who was an expert on New Nellie City, had to say.

There are many things we don't know, such as how the Quardenze family will actually act, how much information they have, and whether the lowly priestess Diana has really been able to dispose of the evidence.

Renessa felt the need to find out what was going on in the city of New Nellie as soon as possible, and closed the meeting of the saints before it fell into disarray.

She felt that making a decision without enough information would be like letting Terotris do what he wanted.

In fact, there is a hint that Terotris wants a war with the Kingdom of Levios.

It's a good thing that we were able to avoid having to start a war with him before he does.

Lante, on the other hand, was pessimistic.

He thought that an open war with the Levios Kingdom was quite possible.

There was a possibility that the Quardenze would not announce the indiscriminate attack by the Holy High Society because they wanted to prioritize the war against the Jinkaen Empire.

However, Lante believed that there was a 50-50 chance that the Quardenze would choose that option.

If the facts were made public, the Leviathans would take up the cause and declare war on Saint Navenpos.

Lante was desperately trying to think of a way to avoid war.

It was only when a cold sweat trickled down his chin that he heard a soft, sweet voice in his ear.

"Priestess Renessa."

"It is the Holy Priestess, isn't it? What brings you to this place?"

Renessa replied to the owner of the voice, and Lante just looked at her in silence.

There was a girl standing there.

She was a girl of an age that could best be described as a girl taking the first steps in her transformation into a woman.

The pure white robe she wore was simple, with only a few gold ornaments sewn into the ends of the sleeves and the edges of the cloth.

It is made of layers of cloth, and to the casual observer, it looks less expensive than a high priest's robe worn by a renaissance man.

However, the cloth was made from the finest pure white silk of the Mamshred Federation.

The clothes, which were worth enough to build a small castle or two, were holy garments that only those in the position of holy priest were allowed to wear.

"Please don't call me a holy priestess. Please, as always.

The way she speaks in a calm tone is that of a saint who knows no dirt.

I'm not sure if it's the light or the black hair that reaches her knees like the darkness of the night, but it has a lustrous shimmer to it that is out of character for a young girl.

Her black, childlike eyes shone like obsidian, making her smile all the more attractive.

Lante, who turned thirty this year, gazed at the girl who could have been his daughter and swallowed his saliva.

As for Renessa, she was a little stunned but relieved to see that the girl's attitude was the same as usual.

"You haven't changed at all, Lorna. The only people in this room right now are from my faction, but you mustn't talk like that anywhere else."

Holy priestess Lorna.

She was a girl who held a position as a symbol of faith in Saint Navenpos.

"So what are you doing here? You don't attend meetings of the Saints, do you?"

The current position of the holy priestess is only a symbol and has no political power.

Since the position is only for the purpose of gaining popularity among the people, beautiful daughters from famous families were usually chosen.

"I have a question for you."

"What is it?"

Renessa used to be Lorna's tutor, and sometimes she would come to her for advice like this.

Most of the consultations had nothing to do with politics, and were mostly about what was wrong with her pets or what she didn't understand in her study of ancient languages.

Sometimes, when Renessa was busy, Lante and his friends would write to her with their answers.

"What’s going on in New Nellie? 　I'm so nervous...I can't sleep at night..."

"Lorna is kind. ..... let's pray to the spirits."

Lante was not too fond of the sweet spirit of the holy priestess.

Yes, she was undoubtedly beautiful and a perfect symbol. But couldn't she have done something about this heartwarming personality?

Why was Lorna, her student, so laid back when Renessa was such a spirited woman?

Lante wanted to end this boring conversation quickly and discuss how to deal with the Levios Kingdom.

However, Lorna slowly denied Renessa's words.

"I am not a stranger. A friend of mine is visiting the church in New Nellie. Oh, ...... how I can only pray that she is safe. ......"

Lante wasn't the only one who was startled by these words.

All of the priests around her, including Renessa, gasped.

The holy priest's friend couldn't be just a commoner, he was definitely from the Holy High Society.

"Who is this friend?　Why were you visiting the church in New Nellie?"

"What?　What's wrong with you, Priestess Renessa? Why do you have such a scary face? ......"

"Just answer me, please. This is very important."

When Renessa shouted, Lorna began to speak in a faltering voice, as if she could read the air a little better.

"I don't know if you know this priestess Renessa, but her name is Cynthia. She is a very kind woman who cares about the scriptures. ......"

"Lante."

When his name is called, Lante immediately twists a priestess named Cynthia out of his memory.

A woman named Cynthia who was close to the holy priestess and was a devout Christian.

The first thing that came to Lante's mind was a female priestess whose breasts caught his attention.

Casually approaching Renessa, Lante told her where Cynthia was from, her affiliation, and her position.

"Lorna, please tell me. Tell me, Lorna, why did priestess Cynthia go to the church in New Nellie City?"

If the holy priestess is trying to become politically powerful, she must have some kind of agenda since she sent her men to New Nelly. Lante looked at Lorna's face and tried to find out what was behind it.

But Lorna's face remained unconcerned.

"It is said that New Nelly City is in the Kingdom of Levios, but the Holy High Church is still there. If that's the case, then it would be possible to get along with the Quardenze family, wouldn't it?"

Of course, Lante would not deny Lorna's words. She is a holy priestess, and her status is much higher than that of Lante, a lowly priestess.

You can't say, "No, of course not."

"If we show the correct beliefs of the Holy High Society, the Quardenze family will surely understand. Cynthia seemed to agree with me and wanted to actually take action. ......, so I gave her some time."

"Cynthia told me that she was going to improve the status of the Holy High Society by working faithfully as a nun, and then she left."

Lante couldn't help but think about that peaceful thought. The same seemed to be true for Renessa.

The holy priestesses of the day were very religious and had no interest in political battles. And there's not much a priestess can do.

As a result, they are neglected by all factions and have little experience in the viciousness of factional conflicts.

She is beautiful and calm, and has probably been surrounded by good intentions her whole life. She believes that if you approach someone with good intentions, they will respond with good intentions.

If the Quardenze family accepts the Holy High Society, the Kingdom of Levios will one day admit its mistakes. There is no mistake in the teachings of the saints.

Seeing the holy priestess who believed in a bright future without a single speck of doubt, Lante couldn't help but wonder if he was the one who was wrong.

"Priestess Renessa?　Um, did I do something wrong ......?"

Lorna said uneasily, as she noticed that everyone in the room had a suspicious look on their faces.

Renessa put her hand on Lorna's shoulder and said admonishingly.

"No," she said. Your idea is a wonderful one. Your ideas are wonderful, they are the very ideals of the Holy High Society. ...... But if you are going to do anything that takes you outside of St. Navenpos, you need to talk to someone. Preferably me."

It sounded a bit like she was trying to get the priestess to join her faction, which was a dangerous thing to say.

But even so, Renessa wanted to reduce the chance that Lorna would be in danger.

For Renessa, who had never been blessed with a child, Lorna was like a daughter to her as well as a student.

"I will look into the movements of Priestess Cynthia at ....... Lorna must not move."

"Yes sir. Yes sir. ...... I made a mistake, Priestess Renessa.

The holy priestess corrected her in a cute way, but Lante looked at her with a cold eye.

Cynthia, like the holy priestess, is definitely a priestess of the so-called faithful.

She is incompatible with the Terrorists, who would not hesitate to unleash mature magical beasts in order to regain the authority of the Holy High Society.

He must have gone to New Nellie City regardless of the plans of the Terrorists and was working without knowing anything about it.

Thinking about this incident, Cynthia would have met a tragic end.

She would be arrested without question just for being in the Holy High Church and tortured to tell the whole truth about the indiscriminate attack plan that she was not supposed to know. She was just genuinely trying to protect the teachings of the saints.

The holy priestess and Renessa prayed to the spirits for her safety, but Lante only prayed that she would be able to meet her end as peacefully as possible.

Renessa, Lante, and the other priests headed straight for Renessa's mansion.

Lante had a position in the church, but his main responsibility was to manage the territory that Renessa owned.

Most of the priests who hold territories live in the Holy City and govern without going to the territories.

Because the territory of St. Navenpos as a whole is not that large, even if a mature demonic beast appears, they can rush from the Holy City in time.

Lante looked around the work area of the mansion and confirmed the situation.

In the last room he visited, a young man was lying on the floor.

"Vidaldo, what are you doing?"

"Ah, the ...... Priest Lante. This is how I work out my calculations."

If you looked, you would see blueprints spread all over the floor.

Lante picked up one of them. It was a blueprint for a bridge.

"Can you really build a bridge this big?"

"Well..."

Vidaldo fell silent.

Thinking it would be a bad idea to interrupt his work by talking to him, Lante decided to look at the other blueprints scattered on the floor. They ranged from designs for bridges and mansions to construction plans for flood control.

He had no idea what the formulas were, but he didn't need to understand them, so he abandoned his thoughts.

In the past, Vidaldo had created unfamiliar blueprints and made them a reality. There was no need for him to encroach on his work.

The only thing that Lante could enjoy was the projected finished painting.

Remembering that Vidaldo used to make money as a painter, Lante felt that it would not be surprising if someone would pay for a painting as magnificent as this one.

"The budget is not enough. I'm running out of money. Let me do more experiments."

"I'm sorry, but we have our hands full with this. I'm sorry Vidaldo, but I hope you can make do with the budget you have."

Renessa appeared from behind Lante.

Lante straightened his posture in fear at the sudden appearance, but Vidaldo remained sprawled out.

"Hey, Vidaldo!　Don't dress so rudely in front of Priestess Renessa!"

"I don't mind. Vidaldo's job is to think, and if no one else is around, he doesn't have to be so formal with me."

"You're a good judge of character, Miss Renessa."

Vidaldo laid down to show Lante his approval and farted.

Vidaldo, the man who had done such a rude thing, was just a commoner. He is not even a priest, let alone a main ancestor. He is a weak man with no magical power.

The only thing that makes him worthy is his genius mind.

Math, architecture, civil engineering, and painting were just a few of his abilities. This young man, who was exceptionally talented in everything, was one of the most valuable people that Renessa had found.

"But the budget is the only thing we can't control," he said. "Can't you do something with the budget you have?"

Renessa was pragmatic and rationalist among the high priests.

She would call low ranking priests like Lante to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints if she thought they were capable, and she had no trouble using laymen like Vidaldo. She believes that everything is for the good of St. Navenpos.

"Lady Renessa, Vidaldo is even using the budget for his own hobby experiments. The more we give him, the more he spends on experiments."

"Good experiments are what give rise to good ideas. I'm just doing my best for Miss Renessa.  So it's okay to experiment a little bit with my hobby.

Lante knew that Vidaldo wasn't completely wrong; there had been several times when his experiments had led to a solution to a problem that had paid off handsomely.

In total, it was a definite plus, but the problem for Lante was that he had too many gold coins to invest.

"I've already given up on the mana crystal experiment, so why don't you give me a little extra?"

"That's a given. If I wanted to buy mana crystal, my finances would be in the red at once. We went to a lot of trouble to make it healthy."

He wanted to be patient with Vidal, though he had a bit of a budget to pay for it.

"It is no laughing matter if the estate is ruined for the sake of the idea of the Rebirth Initiative."

Renessa was currently working on a plan called the "Rebirth Initiative".

Right now, she was putting all her energy into reorganizing and revitalizing her territory.

Lante's organizational reforms had gone smoothly, and Renessa's territory, which had been in the red for years, had become healthier.

Since Vidaldo's arrival, a number of facilities and tools using new technology have been created, and productivity has increased dramatically.

Renessa had planned to make achievements in her own territory first, and then advocate for the reform of St. Navenpos as a whole.

The plan was to do so and take control of the reforms, streamline the governance structure, and increase the power of the country to compete with the Kingdom of Levios.

"Rebirth, huh? It's all the rage."

For the past ten years or so, an idea called "Reincarnation" has been spreading in St. Navenpos.

In the past, the Holy High Society had influence all over the continent and boasted immense authority. Today, however, St. Navenpos has fallen and is not even a shadow of its former self.

The basic idea of reincarnation is to regain the authority of the Holy High Church as it was in the classical era, because the current situation is not good.

This is a vague idea, and it depends on how you look at it.

For Renessa, Nativism is about opposing the kingdoms and empires by correcting the organization, making it financially sound, and boosting the economy and culture, as the cause of the corrupt Holy High Society itself.

For Terotris, reincarnation is about demonstrating the power of the priests by overthrowing the nobility through force and violence.

For the holy priestess Lorna, reincarnation means reexamining the scriptures to regain the correct faith and become a virtuous priest, because the Holy High Priestess has lost faith and fallen.

"In the meantime, why are you so involved in the Rebirth Movement?　I think you should only think about your own territory, I think..."

In response to Vidaldo's light tone, Renessa turned a serious expression on her face.

"It is to protect a world where people can live as people."

"What?"

Vidaldo, who had been expecting her to answer with some definite benefit, gave a distracted reply.

The two of them were in the kingdom of Levios.

"Are you two aware of the current situation in the Kingdom of Levios?　The Holy High Church has been destroyed and the faith is in ruins."

The Church of the Holy High Priest has been destroyed and the faith is on the verge of extinction," Renessa said slowly, as if she was a teacher teaching.

"Of course. It is nothing but the arrogance of the aristocracy. Destroying a church is unacceptable."

"I've never been to the Kingdom of Levios, but I hear it's like that. Priests have a hard time finding jobs."

There is no priest in St. Navenpos who does not know that the Kingdom of Levios is destroying the Holy High Church.

Lante was unsure of Renessa's true intentions for asking such a question.

When Renessa heard both of their answers, she exhaled deeply.

"No, you don't know anything about it. I am not talking about the Church of the Holy High Society or the priests. I'm talking about the people."

"The people?"

"I'm not talking about the Holy High Church or the priests."

"Do you know how the people in the Kingdom of Levios live now?　Do you know how the people in the Kingdom of Levios live now? How do they decide what is good and what is evil?"

"Good and evil are things that common sense can tell us."

"What you mean by common sense is the teachings of the Holy High Society. The common sense you are referring to is the teaching of the Holy High Church. ...... Priest Lante, a child must not kill his parents. Why is that?"

"It's in the scriptures. ......"

"That's it," said Renessa, clapping her hands.

"The child must not kill the parent. That's what the scriptures say. So, Priestess Lante, if you were to ask the people of the Kingdom of Levios the same question, what would they say?"

"I don't know, ..............................."

"There is no Holy High Church in the Kingdom of Levios. This means that there are no priests to read the scriptures to the people."

"This means that the people of the Kingdom of Levios do not have access to the scriptures."

"That's what I mean. We don't know what the people of Levios think is good and what they think is bad. This is very frightening, don't you think?"

"...... It is, indeed."

"There are people for whom common sense, which we take for granted, does not apply at all. I think that is terribly unsettling, don't you?"

Lante felt that he understood what Renessa was trying to say.

"Our values are based on common sense, based on the scriptures of the Holy High Society. I had an instinctive fear that there were people in the Kingdom of Levios who could not understand that at all."

"What I have just said is an extreme example, because even without priests, there is common sense that can be passed from parent to child."

Renessa continued.

"But the Church has been destroyed for about eighty years, the people are weaker than we are, and the generations change quickly. The common sense that is handed down from parent to child will fade as the generations go by. There is no priest in the Kingdom of Levios who can point that out."

This means that there will be a growing gap in common sense with St. Navenposs.

The common sense that needs to be conveyed will fade away, and even if the wrong common sense gets mixed in, there will be no priest to correct it.

Since there is no unified teaching like the Holy High Society, each person creates his or her own sense of values, and as many people as there are, common sense is born.

"What do you think will happen to the people of the Kingdom of Levios if the current situation continues for 100 or 200 years? Do you think you will be able to work hand in hand with the people who live there?　Can you trust them with your heart?"

"...... cannot."

As if to cover Lante's answer, Renessa continued.

"It's the same for them. The people of the Kingdom of Levios will not be able to trust the people of the Holy High Society because they will not be able to understand them. It's a world where people can't trust others."

"It is a world of beasts," Renessa assured him.

"Once that happens, all that awaits is endless killing. ......"

Lante felt that people who were blind to their beliefs were like beasts.

But he had never imagined that someone would see him as a beast.

"The teachings of the Founder Zesu, and the teachings of the saints, do not exist only for the benefit of the Holy High Society. They are teachings that are necessary for people to live hand in hand."

Lante nodded silently.

"We, the Society of the Holy High Priest, have forgotten our mission in the past and have allowed ourselves to be corrupted by our obsession with authority and the rise of the nobility. Faith should not be for priests. Faith must not be for priests, for it is necessary for man to live as a man, not a beast."

"Yes."

"We must rebuild St. Navenpos and turn the people back to the ways of men, not the ways of beasts. That is our mission and our responsibility."

Having watched Renessa struggle with the idea of the rebirth, Lante was convinced that she meant what she said.

He opened his clenched fist and saw that he was sweating slightly.

That was the end of the conversation, and tea was prepared by Renessa, who said she was thirsty after her powerful speech.

As the three of us were drinking tea, Renessa reminded me, "I remember in the saints' meeting, you said that Priest Lante had become familiar with the territory of Quardenze. Who told you that?

"Oh, that's Vidaldo. Isn't he the one who knows the most about the Quardenze family in this house?

When Vidaldo heard his name called, he turned his gaze only to Lante.

"Oh, What interest did Vidaldo have?"

"I've heard that in the last few years the Quardenze has been making a name for itself, and that New Nelly Silk has been making soap and other unusual things, as well as the Nambonan market."

As they looked at him, Vidaldo stood up and picked up a book from the shelf.

Placing the book on his desk, he said, "Here. This. It's a book made in New Nellie City."

Renessa took the book and flipped through the pages.

The last page was stamped with the author's name and the seal of the bindery.

You're still reading that boring book?"

Lante had read the book before, but had stopped reading halfway through.

Lante wondered why a man as smart as Vidaldo would keep such a book in his possession.

"Isn't it boring?"

Vidaldo did not respond to Renessa's question, so Lante answered instead.

"Well, what can I say? ...... It's a boring book. It's ridiculous. I think it is a book made by a rich man for pleasure. The author's name looks like a pseudonym.

"Oh dear. Then what did Vidaldo find to be so excellent?

Vidaldo did not say anything. It's not as if he was embarrassed by his favorite book.

"I think you should read it once, Lady Renessa. Then I will answer you.

Vidaldo then pulled some more books off the shelf and placed them in front of Renessa.

When Renessa's eyes fluttered, he continued.

"So far, this is all I have."

"So many ....... These are books that were sold in the city of New Nelly in the territory of the Quadrant, right?　What did you do with the money?　If you buy them here, you'll have to pay more to the merchant, right?

"I paid for it out of my salary. I'm living in poverty.

"Oh, my God. ......"

In order to keep the genius Vidaldo around, Renessa is giving him an unbelievable amount of gold coins as his salary.

Knowing the amount of gold she had prepared, Renessa was horrified to find that they had been turned into books.

"It's such an interesting book. And I'm curious about the author. See, if you replace them like this: ......"

With that, Vidaldo brought out a wooden letter for notes.

Vidaldo wrote the author's name on it, and then wrote down each of the words that made up the name in a different order.

"............ Quardenze Wilk?"

What appeared there was the name of the legitimate son of the Quardenze family, which had been the topic of conversation at the meeting of the saints.

"Yes. I was wondering if the author of this book is actually a nobleman. That would be really interesting. Interesting. And the latest volume is really exciting, I can't wait to read the next one."

Neither Lante nor Renessa noticed that Vidaldo's eyes were shining brightly.

"I can't wait to read the next volume. I'm sure you'll have a hard time getting it if you go to war with the Levios Kingdom. ......"

"What?"

Even though Renessa was hiring him, Vidaldo was not a priest, just a commoner.

Lante hesitated to tell Vidaldo about the contents of the meeting with the saints.

"Are you sure, Lady Renessa?"

"It will soon become a rumor, so let us tell the story ourselves."

Lante reconsidered, "It's true that bad rumors like this spread quickly.

If that's the case, it's better to tell them first than to let them hear exaggerated information.

Lante agreed with Renessa's idea and decided to tell Vidaldo about the situation.

"Huh.　The ...... die is cast, huh?"

Vidaldo muttered, and Lante picked up his words.

"What's that?"

It's a quote from a general in this book. Remember it well, it will come in handy soon.

Lante felt something disturbing about Vidaldo's fearless smile.

The next day.

Vidaldo had disappeared, leaving only one letter.

The letter said, in summary, "I'm moving to New Nelly City because I don't want to lose the ability to read the latest volumes. I'll pay you back this month's salary in books. Bye-bye."

Not wanting to give up a brain as smart as Vidaldo's, Renessa and Lante immediately sent their men after him.

In order to get to New Nellie City from St. Navenpos, all they had to do was to head north along the great river.

They couldn't deny that they was too proud to think that they could catch up with Vidaldo, who had no magic power.

In the end, Renessa and the others were unable to find Vidaldo.

At the same time that Lante and the others were in trouble, Vidaldo was on a ship crossing the great river.

There was no need to cross the river to get to the city of New Nelly, but Vidaldo had crossed it in anticipation of his pursuers.

If Priest Lante had read the book, he would have known.

If he had been caught, he would have been caught, so Vidaldo playfully told Lante, "The die is cast."

In the book, the general who said "the die is cast" was in the process of crossing the river, implying that he was crossing the great river to New Nellie.

"Now, what to do?"

The Quardenze family seemed to have a lot of money, so if possible, he would also like to get a job similar to the one he had when he was employed by Renessa.

Either way, he would like to meet the legitimate son of the Quardenze family.

Vidaldo was sure that if he could get a meeting with him, he would be able to show his talent and get some kind of job.

The most troublesome part was to get the meeting.

He needed a souvenir that would attract the attention of the nobles.

"Hey, where are you going?"

A sailor on a break spoke to Vidaldo.

He thought about it for a moment and then said.

"I'm going to go back to my hometown to see the sea, and then New Nellie City."


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 124 - Financial Affairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I got off the carriage when I saw Nambonan City.

It was a small hill where I could get a bird's eye view of the city.

It was probably a popular spot because of the great view, and there were several travelers sitting on the ground nearby, taking a rest.

Looking around the city from a distance, I saw a line of horse-like creatures with a body shape similar to a dachshund carrying sugar cubes.

When I looked closely to see what they were, I realized that they were made of stone, processed into squares and rectangles. The size of each stone was probably about the size of a one-door refrigerator.

It was only a few days ago that the government had given permission to rebuild the city walls, but it seemed that construction had already started.

A polygon of brown lines was drawn on the ground surrounding the entire city of Nambonan. They were probably the remains of the ground that had been turned over during the land clearing.

Surprisingly, Nambonan City had enough financial resources to rebuild the city walls.

The payment of reparations to the Quardenze family was also proceeding without any problems. It was hard to believe that the city had surrendered after losing the war.

The merchants were not discouraged; rather, they saw the fact that they had become part of the Quardenze territory as an opportunity and were moving about actively.

The dream city of freedom from the aristocracy is gone, but its economic growth shows no sign of slowing down.

"It's ...... raining."

At first I thought it was the sound of grass and trees swaying in the wind, but it was the sound of raindrops hitting the leaves.

As a drop of rain fell on my cheek, the rainfall became stronger and stronger.

Not wanting to get wet in the cold winter air, I climbed into the carriage and headed back to Nambonan City.

The papers were piled up in the mayor's office.

For the time being, I called the civil servants to check and process them.

There weren't too many, as I had only been away for a few days, and the desk was soon cleaned.

"The mayor will be returning to New Nellie City. ......"

As I was checking the schedule with the civilian, Rumon muttered to me.

""Hmm?　Is there any entertainment left?"

"No, it's not like that. ......"

I plan to return to New Nellie City to spend the New Year's holiday with my family.

At the beginning of the year, the knightly families in the territory come to greet each other, and I have to deal with them.

I'm not going to take him to New Nellie's because Kohli has requested that he continue to live in Nambonan.

I think he'll be more refreshed without me since he can spend time with his cute sister. I don't know why she's so sad that I'm leaving.

Does he really want me to do the paperwork for him?

I urged Rumon, who had fallen silent, to continue speaking.

"...... General Galfis is now concentrating on building the castle. I was worried that the old Voistra's forces might take advantage of the mayor's absence to attack Nambonan City."

At the frontline base in the westernmost part of the Quadrant, the construction of the castle is progressing smoothly.

My grandfather told me that because of the threat it posed to the old Voistra, reconnaissance troops were frequenting the area.

If my grandfather is away for a long time, there is a possibility that the old Voistra will attack the front base with their main force in order to sabotage the construction. Therefore, my grandfather would have to put more weight on the front base.

The last time I was in New Nellie, my grandfather visited Nambonan several times while I was temporarily back home, but I'm sure this will decrease in the future.

In such a situation, Rumon seems to be worried about me returning to New Nellie City.

No, he's probably speaking for the citizens of Nambonan, so it's better to think of this as their opinion.

"The city of Nambonan is packed with troops, don't worry."

It was the civil officer, not me, who responded to Rumon's concerns.

The military is still stationed in Nambonan. Their activities range from defending the city, maintaining security, replacing front-line bases, and hunting down remnants.

They rotate their troops so that they can keep a certain number of followers, so there was always a certain amount of strength in Nambonan City.

"You seem to have something to say. Tell me."

He didn't seem to be satisfied with the officer's answer, so I asked for more input.

Rumon thanked me and then opened his mouth.

"I'm worried that the nobles of the old Voistra will attack us."

"Nobles?　...... Ah, the main force."

In general, nobles don't come out to the battlefield very often.

The troops led by knights and commoners open up the battle lines and go out to fight after they have been set up to attack.

In a sense, this is similar to the way of fighting a mature magical beast.

"Rumon, I thought you were smart, but you don't seem to know anything about the military. There's no way the main force will come."

A literary officer from a knightly family says to Rumon as if to admonish him.

They had been familiar with war and the military from an early age, and had some knowledge that Rumon did not have.

"The old Voistra has its hands full defending itself. It's a good thing that I'm not the only one who knows about the military.　And it is not General Galfis who will miss the opportunity."

"That's right. And if they had wanted to attack it, they would have done so before it became part of the Quardenze territory, wouldn't they?"

The other civil servants from the knightly families also developed their own arguments.

But Rumon refuted them without hesitation.

"But the walls are gone."

The walls, made of a special stone material that repels magic, were literally the biggest barrier to the capture of Nambonan City.

The Quardenze army was fortunate to have been able to capture it, but it would have been a bit of a hassle if they had been able to use it as a shield.

However, the walls were dismantled and converted into a frontline base where my grandfather is now. Today, Nambonan City is completely bare.

"The old Voistra has no generals who can take on such an army."

The duke of the old Voistra is treated as a weakling, but there is nothing that can be done about that.

Basically, in wars between territories, knights and commoners mainly fight, and nobles only appear in decisive situations.

Once the knights and commoners have won a certain amount of victories, a discussion is held, and it is often settled by giving them reparations or making them accept some demands.

Only a few noblemen, like my grandfather, go out to the front to rampage and disrupt the war.

The civil servants also continued to explain to Rumon that the possibility of invading Nambonan City was low from a military standpoint, including the number of nobles and knights in the former Voistra, the number of commoners, and the benefits of an invasion.

"So ......, attacking Nambonan City would be a pretty bad bet. I don't think the cautious old Voistra would choose it."

The explanation was well reasoned, and I didn't see anything I should point out.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure that if you're a child of a knightly family, you're familiar with military matters, even if you're a civil servant.

Rumon seemed to understand the explanation, but he didn't seem to be convinced.

I turned to Rumon, who was trying to figure out how to respond.

"What you've just heard is the conclusion of someone who knows military standards. Rumon, the reason you're not convinced is because you've come to a conclusion based on a different standard.　Based on what?"

That seemed to be just the right helping hand for Rumon, and he smiled for a moment.

"The merchant's standard, sir."

"Hmm. Tell me ....... I'll allow it."

Rumon took a deep breath, then looked at me.

"Old Voistra is in financial trouble due to the prolonged war. The major cities are exhausted, the lords are suffering from heavy taxes, and the city of Ocellaria is losing its momentum. According to merchants familiar with ...... the Old Voistra, most of the territories are close to financial ruin."

Rumon, probably preparing to explain this case, took out a document from a nearby shelf and laid it on the desk.

There was a detailed description of the financial situation of several noble families, formerly known as the Voistra.

The information was gathered from the city's logistics, the increase and decrease in trade volume, and connections with local influential people who were close to them.

Apparently, Rumon had commissioned a merchant in Nambonan City to act as a spy.

According to the data, the finances of all the noble families of the former Voistra have deteriorated rapidly since the annexation of Nambonan City to the territory of Quardenze.

"Why has it gotten so bad?"

''Because of the loss of aid from ...... Nambonan City, and merchants avoiding the old Voistra for fear of war.

The city of Nambonan, when it was at odds with the territory of Quardenze, was using its ample assets to wage a dark war.

The old Voistra, being a sworn enemy of the Quardenze family, seemed to have received a great deal of assistance.

However, Nambonan City was annexed to the Quardenze territory. Naturally, Nambonan City's aid to the former Voistra was reduced to zero.

On the contrary, the Nambonan merchants refrained from doing business with the former Voistra, fearing that they might be suspected by the Quardenze family if they were not careful.

And peddlers from other parts of the world, concerned about the escalation of the war, began to avoid the territory of the former Voistra.

It is no wonder that the financial situation deteriorated so rapidly.

The longer these financial problems continue, the more painful they will become. At this rate, the territory may collapse before General Galfis can attack.

"Hmm."

"The sooner you start, the better. If you find yourself in a situation like that, and you see Nambonan City with no walls in front of you, ......"

There is a possibility that they might attack Nambonan City at the drop of a hat before it becomes completely untenable.

Even if they can't take it over, if they can get some temporary money by looting it, they can still breathe.

The nobles of the former Voistra, who had received aid from the city, would be well aware of the fact that Nambonan was a wealthy city.

"I'll keep Rumon's comments in mind."

In the unlikely event that the troops led by the nobles attacked Nambonan City, the current troops could only buy time.

I made a note in my brain to check the communication system with New Nellie City again.

Either way, not returning to New Nellie City is not an option.

After finishing the paperwork and letting the civil servants out, I was drinking tea by myself when Rumon came back to the mayor's office.

There's a man here who wants to see the mayor.

"By the look on your face, I'd say you're not a very nice person. ......:

The Rumon then smiled bitterly.

"He's the merchant who was Kohli's fiancée."

I remember Kohli and Rumon saying that there was such a man.

Kohli, who was a pawn in a political marriage, was going to become the property of a perverted old man who was more than a year older than her.

The "pervert" part is just my imagination. I've never seen him before.

"Mmm?　Didn't you say you'd tell him to stay away from Kohli?"

The perverted merchant had been lingering around Kohli even after his father's downfall, but Rumon had protested recently and made him stop.

"Yes.. There is no longer any sign of the man around Kohli."

It seemed that the man was not foolish enough to mess with Kohli, who had become a 'noble's concubine'.

Rumon's relieved expression showed that this was the truth.

"Even though you didn't know about it, you still tried to touch Kohli. I wanted to apologize to the mayor for that at all costs. ......"

"So what's the truth?"

"I've come for an apology, and to bring a gift."

"I see."

When the perverted merchant found out that Kohli was my mistress, he probably didn't feel like living.

The end result of a commoner who messes with a nobleman's mistress is nothing short of horrific.

However, I feel that it is typical of a merchant who will not just get up and try to make an impression by using the meeting to apologize.

"What can I do for you, sir?　The man's business association is quite vicious and has a very bad reputation in the city."

Rumon's father had a bad reputation, but it seems that the perverted merchant is also a very disliked person.

It seems that similarity calls for friendship, both on Earth and on the Eruo continent.

"There are also suspicions of tax evasion by the merchant association, and there are plans to have the military take them down within the year. They might even bring bribes to get them to forgive their tax evasion."

In the past, the military has raided several business associations and organizations at the request of civilian officials.

There were several times when I remembered signing documents regarding permission for the military to go into action.

As I aim to become the next head of the family, I'm not foolish enough to allow tax evasion with a short-term bribe.

Well, even if I were to take a bribe, I would have no problem lying low and arresting him since I'm a noble.

"I don't care. Let him through."

Since he had come all this way to curry favor, he should be able to expect some kind of tribute.

What would a vile merchant bring?

It's either money, rare objects, or women.

Chapter 125 - A kidnapped village girl eaten at a perverted club run by a corrupt merchant (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


A sobbing voice was echoing in the dimly lit room as dusk was approaching.

I don't know whose voice it is, but it probably belongs to more than one person.

There are a lot of women in this room, but no one tries to comfort them.

Because that's what they always do.

But I'm not strong enough to get used to the sobs and pretend not to be upset.

Just listening to them made me feel uneasy, and I pulled the blanket closer to my face.

"Are you cold, Sis?"

My younger brother, Kianes, responded to my movement and said in a quiet voice, "I'm cold, sister.

There is only one blanket in the house, and it is used by me and Kianes. I pulled the blanket away from him, and which he seems to have taken away from me.

"No, it's okay. I'm sorry."

"You can use it. It's cold, isn't it?"

With that, Kianes moves the blanket towards us.

"I'm fine. You're colder than me, aren't you?　Here, it's warmer this way."

Kianes hands were bound with metal chains.

I'm already unchained, but I still remember the feeling of being tied up. The chains were chilled by the cold winter air, and it hurt so much that I thought my wrists would tear.

When I hugged Kianes and touched the chains, the unique coldness of the metal stole the body heat from my fingertips.

In order to make the chain a little warmer, I let out a gasp of air.

"Ow! ......!"

"The bruise. ......"

I'm sure it's because he's been bound by chains for so long that he has bruises on his wrists.

I felt sad when I saw the reddish-black color of her skin against the slight rays of the setting sun.

I wrapped Kianes' hands in a blanket so as not to expose him too much to the cold outside air.

"It's okay!　I'm strong!"

Kianes was trying to be strong, but it was clear that he was pushing himself too hard.

If he stayed here, his mind would be exhausted before his body.

"Yes, you're right. But don't overdo it, okay?"

"I know, I know. I know. And don't push yourself too hard either. I'll protect you."

"Thank you."

I felt tears well up in my eyes as I saw my brother trying his best to keep his promise to his father even in this situation.

"I want to go back to the village. ......"

"Yes. ......"

When I closed my eyelids to cover my moist eyes, all I could think of were the memories of the village.

Kianes and I were born in a small village in the mountains.

It's an ordinary farming village where not many merchants come.

We always had a hard time finding money, but our family was always happy together.

It was not long ago that all of this life was destroyed.

It all started when a merchant told the village about a rumor. The rumor was that the city of Nambonan was looking for mercenaries at an unbelievable rate.

Nambonan City is a rich city.

I knew it well because I had been there several times with my father to sell crops, and since a rich city was recruiting mercenaries, I was sure they would be paid well.

My thoughts were the same as the thoughts of everyone in the village.

My father, brother, and other men from the village had gone to Nambonan City as mercenaries and rarely returned.

I was told by one of the men who escaped with his life that Nambonan City was gathering mercenaries to fight against the Lord.

There are only commoners in Nambonan City, not even knights. It's really a terrible story.

If I had known that they were recruiting mercenaries to fight against the lord, my father and brother would never have gone to Nambonan City.

My father and brother never came back. All the remaining members of the family spent many days in sorrow.

But the misfortune was not over yet.

Most of the mercenaries that Nambonan City had gathered were killed or captured by the lord, but it seems that some of them escaped.

One of the mercenaries that escaped came to our village and started looting.

The mercenaries took many things from our village. Not only money and food, but also the lives of everyone in the village.

It just so happened that we had a place to hide in the barn, which saved me, my mom and Kianes.

It was only the three of us left in the family for a month, but we didn't have time to be depressed.

There was nothing left in the house, and not many survivors in the village.

Kianes and I began to go into the mountains to gather food to help our mother.

Then one day, Kianes and I went to the river to catch fish.

We were so engrossed in catching fish that we didn't notice the kidnappers who approached us.

No, even if we had noticed them, we would not have been able to escape. There was no way that Kianes and I would have been able to defeat the grown men.

This is how Kianes and I were caught by the kidnappers and brought to Nambonan City.

The kidnapper was apparently a servant of a merchant who works in Nambonan City.

I think it's ironic that we were kidnapped by a merchant in Nambonan City.

Not only did they cheat on my father and brother, but they also kidnapped me and Kianes.

Most of the women are kidnapped by the same kidnappers as me and Kianes, and locked in this room.

The entrance and exit of the room has metal bars, so it is a prison itself, except that the people inside have not committed any crime.

"I hope mother is well. ......"

Me and Kianes suddenly disappeared. I wondered if my mother was okay.

I wondered if she was worried about us.

I found myself with tears running down my cheeks.

"Don't cry, Sis. I'm with you, so please, don't cry. ...... sister......"

I had to be strong as a big sister, but I couldn't stop the tears from flowing.

My tears seemed to have become a catalyst for Kianes' tears, and her voice gradually became tearful.

"It's okay, it's okay, ....... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kianes. ......"

I hugged his to my chest so that he could not see my face.

It was a little while later, when the area was completely dyed in the dark.

"There was even a boy here ....... Are they sister and brother ......?"

An adult woman sitting close to me must have noticed that we were talking quietly, because she started talking to me.

Most of the people who were brought here were very dark, but sometimes they were very talkative.

As far as I knew, Kianes was the only boy in the room, so she might have been curious and wanted to talk to him.

"Yes, I'm Tico."

"and I'm Kianes."

The woman also gave her name, and we talked about our villages.

While I was in a depressed mood, I could forget about reality while we talked about our memories.

The woman seemed to like gossip, and often told stories that she must have acquired in this house.

"The owner of this house is said to be a famous merchant in Nambonan City, though he was born in the Levios territory, not Nambonan City. Would you understand if I said Levios Kingdom?"

I only knew the name because it was the domain of the king of the Levios Kingdom.

I don't know where it is, but it must be so far away that you have to cross the great river three times to get there.

"I know the name."

"I know the name, too. I heard it from an old man in the neighborhood."

When I said that, the woman gave me a heartfelt look of disgust and said as if to throw up.

"So, do you know this?　People in Levios' territory don't mind doing bad things, you know?　Do you know why?

We had been kidnapped and brought here, and I knew from experience that they were people who didn't mind doing bad things.

We both looked at each other and had a look of uncertainty on our faces.

"In Levios' domain, children who break the spirit's teachings are praised."

"Really?　I don't believe it."

"It's not true."

Kianes and I denied the woman's words.

The woman did not seem to be offended and continued.

"No, it's true. No, it's true, I heard it. I heard that all the children in Levios' territory ignore the teachings of the spirits. I had a talk with a priest who was traveling there, and he told me that.　Levios territory is a really scary place. ......!"

The woman seemed to be really frightened by what she had said, which made me feel uneasy.

"The owner of this place was born in the Levios territory, so he could do such atrocious things ....... ...... I hate it. ......"

The woman was no longer looking at me or Kianes.

She must have been taken out of her room several times before.

At night here, men called "servants" come in and take away a few women.

I don't know what kind of criteria they use to select them, but I was told that the women who were unlucky enough to be taken were treated badly in another room.

The women would come back to this room the next morning, looking pitifully weak.

Some of the women never come back. No one talks about it, but I think they must be dead.

This is why women who have experienced the "outside room" even once begin to sob in the evening.

Fortunately or unfortunately, Kianes and I have never left this room since we were brought here.

We even poo and pee in the tub in the corner of the room. There was no room for escape.

As I pondered what to say to the woman who was beginning to give off a gloomy vibe, a loud voice echoed through the room.

"There are footsteps!　Coming ......!　Ah, ahhh!"

The surroundings were already dark, and I couldn't tell who was saying those words.

But the tone of his voice, tinged with fear, was so sharp that it pierced my brain.

The sharp words easily cut through what little peace was left in the room.

Everyone raced to wrap themselves in blankets and hide from the servants who would be coming.

"Sis!"

"Yes!"

For the time being, I imitated everyone else and got under the blanket.

It's a good thing that I'm not the only one.

"Aaahhhh!　Aaaaah!"

Suddenly, a high-pitched scream was heard from behind the blanket, followed by a thick male voice that seemed to control it.

The servants were trying to take the woman away.

"Get up now!　Come here!"

"Help me!　No!　No more!　Take me back to the village!　Help me!　Somebody help me!　Dad!　Dad!"

My hands tighten around the blanket.

I'm scared.

The woman's scream was getting farther and farther away. It was as if I was sinking into the depths of darkness.

"Heee!"

"Aaah!"

I could hear the sound of a blanket being flipped over, as if it was looking for someone.

It was approaching us with a scream and at a great speed.

"Sis, ......."

"Kianes, it's okay, it's okay. ......"

I said to myself.

I could not remain silent, even though my voice might be heard.

I couldn't contain the fear that was rising in my throat.

"Kyaaa!"

Suddenly, the blanket was taken away with a tremendous force.

When I opened my eyes, there were two men standing there.

"Is this him?"

"Yes, that's him. He has a sister."

He was looking for me. ......

My heart began to beat wildly and my hands began to shake as I realized that I was about to be taken out of the room.

The shaking was even transmitted to Kianes, who was in close contact with me.

"Stop it!　Don't take my sister!"

Kianes slipped in between the two servants and me and stood up.

But the servants only looked at me.

"Your name is Tico, right?　I'm taking you with me. Now get up."

"Just be quiet, boy."

The taller servant's hand reaches out to grab me.

It was Kianes who reacted quickly.

"I'll protect you, sister!"

Kianes kicked the taller servant in the shin as hard as he could.

The only problem was that his hands were chained together, making it difficult for him to keep his center of gravity.

Besides, Kianes was only twelve years old, and his strength was far below that of a muscular adult male servant.

But it seemed to be enough to make the servant angry.

"You little bastard!"

A dry sound echoed in the room as the servant slapped Kianes on the cheek.

The sound was so loud that I couldn't help but imagine the pain Kianes had suffered, and I felt a cold sweat run down my spine.

Another woman screamed in response to the violence, which set off a chain of events that sent the room into a frenzy.

"Hey!　You've been taking advantage of me!　You're a man, and you need to know that I'm letting you stay in this room out of pity?

Kianes' hair was gripped tightly by the violent servant and he was forced to turn his face upwards.

I tried to say I was sorry, to ask for forgiveness for what Kianes had done.

But I couldn't move. I was scared.

I was just scared that a grown man would use violence in such an intimidating way.

"Hey, don't do that. Take the brother with you, don't let him get hurt yet."

"Oh ...... Oh, right. ...... Damn it, that's why I hate male kids. I'm sure you'll be fine with just this girl. I'm not sure what to do with him."

I felt my skin crawl at the lowly smile of the violent man, but I was more worried about Kianes.

He was thrown out of the room and lay on the floor shaking. He must be crying.

"If you don't want to end up like your brother, get up. This is the last time I'm going to be nice to you."

The shorter servant's tone was calm and cool, but there was an eeriness to him that the violent servant didn't have.

It's a ruthless feeling.

I stood up, trying not to make any pretense of disobeying the ruthless servant.

My legs were shaking with fear, and I could feel that my knees were about to break.

My whole body was shaking, and my breath was labored as if I were drowning at the bottom of the water.

Even so, I mustered up my small, squeezed heart and continued to stand.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 126 - A kidnapped village girl eaten at a perverted club run by a corrupt merchant (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The walls were equipped with evenly spaced candlesticks.

The shadows seemed to be beckoning to me from the depths of the darkness, and I found myself wrapping my arms around myself as if to hug myself.

"Walk quickly."

The violent servant was in front of me and the cruel servant was behind me, forming a line between us.

I'm not handcuffed, but I don't think I can escape in this situation.

I walked in silence, feeling fear in the voice of the cruel servant on my neck.

"No. ......Ugh. ......Oh, no. ......"

The women who had been taken out of the room with me had apparently all experienced the "outside room" before.

After we left the room, we walked around crying the whole time.

I don't know what awaited me, but I could fully understand the horror of it.

"Um, Kianes, ...... is my brother ......?"

When I left the room, Kianes went away, accompanied by another servant.

Kianes, who did not want to be separated from me, was repeatedly beaten and dragged away.

I was afraid of the cruel servant, but I was even more afraid that Kianes would disappear like this.

My hands, feet, and even my voice trembled as I asked the question in desperation.

"Shut up and walk."

"...... Yes."

But I got no answer.

I was afraid of him getting angry if I continued to speak. I slowly closed my half-open mouth.

After a short walk down a creepy corridor, the women and I were ushered into a small room.

According to the conversations of the servants, this room was called the restroom. There were several women working in the room.

"Come here so we can clean you up."

Apparently, each one of us would be assigned a servant.

I was quickly undressed by the servant women.

I was embarrassed because there were others nearby, but I couldn't resist them.

I was carefully wiped down with a wet cloth and my hair was combed.

After being cleaned and polished, I was put into my new clothes. From the feel of the fabric, I knew it must be very expensive.

"Wow."

Feeling the supple softness of the cloth on my skin, I checked my image in the mirror stone placed in front of me.

The new dress looks like something a princess would wear.

Unlike the linen dress I wear in the village, it is very beautiful.

It was dyed a light purple, probably chosen to match the color of my hair.

My hair, which had only been tied up with strings, was taken down and lightly bound with a hair ornament.

The combination of my purple hair and the dress seemed to suit me very well.

In spite of the situation, I felt a little bit of pleasure in seeing myself become more mature.

"Okay, you're done."

"What?　But I'm not wearing anything. ......"

The only thing I'm wearing now is this dress.

The length of the dress is only above the knee, so if you turn it up a little, you will be able to see the part of the body that should not be shown.

"That's fine, now back off."

They pushed me back and sent me off to the servants.

The women who were brought in with me seemed to have gone through the same make-up and wardrobe changes.

They all wore the same color of dress, but the breasts and buttocks of the adult women stood out more.

"You look like shit. I wish you'd do the same for me."

"Shut up. If your husband hears about this, he'll fire you.

"I know!"

While listening to the exchange between the servants, we left the restroom.

The women walking by looked much darker than when we had entered the restroom.

I could feel my heart beating faster with each step I took down the hallway.

I was shivering alone in the room the servants called "the waiting room".

After leaving the restroom, we were brought to this waiting room.

There were other women there, but one by one they were called out and left the room.

Now I'm the only one left.

"Oh no, ...... oh no, ...... Kianes, where did you go, ......?"

Just a few minutes ago, I was casually sitting with my head against the wall when I heard a sound from the other side of the wall.

I made the mistake of listening to see what it was.

It was the screams of the women who had been taken before me.

As soon as I heard it, my heart skipped a beat and I sat down on the floor holding my knees.

I sat down on the floor with my knees in my lap, my buttocks touching the floor directly because I wasn't wearing anything.

It was so cold that my buttocks touched the floor directly.

"Ew ......, this is disgusting ......, mom ......."

The window of this waiting room was high up, so there was no way to escape.

The servants said that I would be the last to be called.

My heart was beating fast and I felt a strong urge to throw up the food I had eaten.

If I'm going to be left in this state, I'd rather they just take me away.

As I was spilling my tears on the floor, the door opened with a squeak.

Standing there was a neatly dressed man.

For a moment, I was hoping that someone kind had come to help me, but that was not the case.

"She's the last of her kind. She's still a child, but she's ...... beautiful. I'm sure you'll be pleased with her."

"Oh, ......."

"Don't be frightened, come here."

I thought it would be better to be taken away than to wait here like this, but after all, fear is fear.

I slowly walked forward to buy as much time as possible, but I was grabbed by the wrist.

I was dragged out of the waiting room.

"Your brother is waiting for you in this room."

"Kianes is ......?"

The man said as he came to a beautifully decorated door.

Considering the position, the screams that had reached the anteroom must have come from this room.

That is to say, the screams of the women were coming from this room.

My knees were shaking and I felt like I was going to fall down.

"Let's go inside."

"...... Yes."

There was no way I could refuse.

I stepped into the door that the servant had opened and proceeded slowly forward.

"Ugh. ......"

There was a strange smell in the room.

It's not the first time I've smelled it, but it's a fishy smell that makes you feel unstable.

The smell seemed to get thicker with each step I took.

As I passed through the door, I saw a man standing by a long partition.

"Now follow this man, the host. See you later."

With that, the servant left the room.

I looked at the man who had been called the host.

"So this is the last woman. Hmm, she's pretty and nice. I'm sure your guests will be pleased."

"Um, is Kianes at ......?"

I mustered up the courage to open my mouth, but the host ignored my question and grabbed my wrist.

As I stepped out of the doorway, I could see the room.

The room was reasonably bright, as candles seemed to be lavishly used.

There were sofas and tables here and there in the large room dyed in the color of the flames.

There were men in gorgeous costumes sitting there.

It was hard to see the depths of the room by candlelight, but I could make out some shadows.

Judging from the words of the servants and the host, they must be the guests.

　

They were licking their lips at me as the host pulled me along.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we have prepared an elaborate spectacle for you at the end," said the host, gesturing to me from a raised platform.

"This beautiful girl's name is Tico. She came here with her brother.

I didn't know what to do, so I listened to the host's words in silence.

He explained where I was from, how I had been living, and how I had been brought here.

I casually looked around the room, but there was no sign of the women. I wondered if they had already been sent back to jail.

"Tico's father had joined the Nambonan defense as a mercenary and never returned to the village. Oh, what a tragedy. ......"

I was told that the guests in this room were all merchants from Nambonan City.

For a moment, I was so angry that I forgot my fears at the lack of emotion at the host's words.

My father and brother died because of these people.

"Her father told her brother to protect Tico until he returned."

The night before he left for Nambonan City, his father told Kianes that it was his job as a man to protect his mother and me in the village.

"Her brother still keeps that promise. If we try to touch Tico, he stands there like a guard dog."

Kianes is desperate to keep his word, believing that his father will come back one day.

It's as if he thinks that the moment he breaks that promise, his father will die.

"Isn't that wonderful sisterly love?"

The host moved his arms in a flowing motion and asked the guests in the room.

The guests agreed in a low tone.

It was as if they were mocking Kianes.

I would like you to see the beauty of love.

I didn't understand what he meant, but the guests seemed to understand what he meant.

"Let's see it.

A visitor sitting on the sofa in the middle of the room said to the host.

A guest sitting in the middle of the room said to the host, "Let's see what you got.

The host smiled wryly and pointed his arm toward the door.

"Tico's brother, Kianes. Your entrance!"

I wondered how long he had been here, but Kianes was standing next to the door.

His cheeks were swollen from the beating, and the bruises on his wrists, exposed by the removal of the chains, looked painful.

"Kianes......"

But what caught my eye more than that was his appearance.

He was there without naked, without any clothing.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 127 - A kidnapped village girl eaten at a perverted club run by a corrupt merchant (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Illuminated by the red flame of a candle, Kianes stood there, completely naked.

When Kianes saw me, he tried to run toward me, but he couldn't. It looked as if someone was grabbing his right arm behind a partition.

"Sis!　Sis!"

"Kianes!"

When I tried to run up to Kianes, the host blocked my way.

I lowered myself and tried to run past him, but he grabbed my arm.

"Kya!"

"Stop!　What are you doing to my sister?"

The next moment, I felt a metallic chill on my neck, and at the same time, Kianes' face became astonished.

"Be quiet for a moment."

A blade is pointed at my neck. Although I couldn't see it, I could tell the size of the blade from the feel of it against my skin.

I think the purpose was to silence Kianes, but it had the opposite effect.

Kianes became distraught and let out an ear-piercing scream.

Children who don't listen need to be punished. ......"

The tone of the host's voice was so horrifying that it made my skin crawl.

The blade that was pressed against my skin was pressed even harder, and I felt as if my legs would break from fear.

"Ah...... ah...... Kianes......."

The sensation of standing faded, and soon my crotch became warm.

I couldn't understand what had happened to me, but I couldn't even turn my head down because of the blade.

I touched my crotch with the hand that was not in the MC's grip and found it soaking wet.

The fear of the blade made me pee my pants.

The robe that was wet with pee and stuck to my skin was very uncomfortable.

I felt shameful, embarrassed, sad, and scared.

"Oh my god, you peed your pants. ......"

"That's a lot. You've been holding back, haven't you?"

"You've been soiling yourself."

The ridicule coming from the people around me pierced my ears.

I was embarrassed to have made a mess like a small child, but now I was being watched by so many people.

The next thing I knew, tears were rolling down my face.

I tried to cover it up with my hand, but it was too late.

The stream of pee dripping down my inner thighs gave me an idea of how strong it was.

"I can't believe you pissed your pants."

The host looked at me and said in a dumbfounded manner.

The blade around my neck was lowered, which calmed me down a bit.

"It's your fault!　Don't laugh at my sister!"

Kianes snapped, making a noise like a wild dog growling.

But a nearby servant slapped him on the stomach and he cowered in place.

"Tico. You can lie down on the sofa there. Your brother is important to you, isn't he?"

"...... Yes, ......."

I didn't disobey, since I didn't want to be held at knifepoint anymore.

I approached the empty couch in the middle of the room.

I was wondering if it was okay to sit down in my wet clothes, but I did as I was told and lay down.

The soft touch on my back felt good.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I must let my brother deal with my sister's misdeeds. Now, Kianes, clean up your dirty sister."

The host shouted in a joyful tone.

Kianes had apparently been tied up behind his back for being too violent.

He moved slowly, probably due to the pain in his stomach from the beating.

"Sis, ......."

"I'm sorry, Kianes. ...... Please, do as these people say. I don't want Kianes to be beaten anymore. Please ......."

I'm afraid of these men, and more than that, I can't stand to see Kianes being beaten by these scary men.

I don't want him to protect me. I don't want them to hurt me any more than they already have.

As if he understood what I was thinking, he clenched his teeth and kept silent.

The host seemed satisfied with his attitude and approached the sofa where I was lying.

"Kianes. Lick this piss-stained area and clean it up. If you care about your sister, you can do it, can't you?"

He said "here" and pointed his finger at my crotch.

I didn't understand what he was saying for a moment. But I knew what it meant.

"Hey, get him close enough for his tongue to reach.

The men around me shouted as if to cheer me up.

I was convinced that my prediction was correct.

"No, no, no!"

I couldn't help but let out a few words when I saw Kianes being held by the neck by the host and brought close to my crotch.

But that only made the men around me happy.

"Sis, ......!"

"Kianes, don't, don't look at ......!　Aah!　No! No!　No, no, no!"

As I desperately tried to escape, I was easily subdued by a servant who was standing behind me.

He made me look like I was changing a baby's diaper.

Considering my position, I think my crotch was completely visible to Kianes.

I never thought I would have to show it to my brother.

My mother had taught me that this was an important place to show only the man I was going to marry.

"If you can't keep it clean, you know what will happen to your sister.　Come on, go protect her."

"Stick it in......!"

Kianes was indignant at the words of the host.

As I shuddered in embarrassment at the prospect of having my crotch examined, a slimy object touched the crack of my hips.

I knew right away that it was Kianes' tongue.

"Oh my God!　No!　Kianes, stop it!　You're disgusting!　No! No!　Stop it!"

Kianes' tongue stopped moving as he screamed in humiliation.

It was only a matter of time before the host gave Kianes an earful in a hushed voice.

"If you stop in the middle of ......, I will kill your sister. You're going to kill her."

"I won't stop!　Sis, just be patient!　I'll finish it right away!　I'll protect you!"

Once again, the hot, sticky stuff crawled up my ass and around my crotch.

My tongue is very powerful because of the incentive of the host. I was aware of the dirt being licked from my crotch.

The men around him watched him licking and ordered him to lick more slowly and where to lick, in an amused tone of voice.

It was so uncomfortable that I couldn't help but shout when he carefully picked at my poop hole.

I was so disgusted that I couldn't help but shout out, "Lero......, churro......, hmmm......."

It's not the same as a finger, but it's different.

The feel of the tongue, which is different from the fingers, and the exquisite warmth of the tongue on the important part of my body makes me feel like I'm about to pee my pants again.

"I don't like it. I don't like it, Keaneth. ...... Oh, ......, ......, ......."

The more I shouted, the more the men around me shouted happily.

I have no idea what's so funny about this humiliation.

"Well, that's pretty good, isn't it?"

"It's a wonderful sisterly love."

"You've got a nice erection for such a young man."

"That's a tasty looking cock!　Mmm-hmm."

The host instructed me to clean my hole as well, and Kianes' tongue entered me.

I've never touched my own hole before, and I'm surprised to find my brother's tongue inside of me.......

A hot sensation spread from my crotch, and sweat dripped down my forehead.

"It's about time. Kianes, come here."

"Ugh, what the hell?　I thought we were done!　I cleaned it properly!"

Kianes finally pulled away from my crotch.

I'm not sure if it's saliva, but the wet crotch is very uncomfortable.

"You're a nasty little brother, getting off on licking your sister's cunt."

Kianes was lifted up by his servant and made to look like a small child being made to pee by his mother.

There was Kianes' cock, standing out like a long, thin gourd.

"Kianes' ......?"

I knew that cocks could grow.

I've seen them plump up a bit when I wiped down Kianes when he was little.

But I'd never seen it grow to the point where it was intact like it was now.

"Oh my God, Sis, don't look at me!　Don't look at me!"

Kianes screamed, but I couldn't look away from it.

"Look at it, Tico, it's a sign that Kianes is excited about your body."

"No, it's not!　No, no, no. ......"

The servant held Kianes mouth and prevented him from speaking.

The host continued to pinch Kianes' cock with his fingertips.

"How do you like it, Tico? Your little brother is all swollen up here. Don't you think it looks really painful?"

His cock was twitching and trembling, and as the host had said, it certainly looked painful.

"The way to calm it down is simple. All you have to do is give it a gentle lick."

"Yeah, ......."

"You can do that, can't you?　Or do you get to lick yourself clean and your brother can't?"

The act of licking a cock was disgusting.

But I let him lick my precious parts, and I don't think I can be the only one to refuse.

"I can... I can ..."

As I said this, a well-dressed man came up to me, who was probably in the back of the room.

It was a man I hadn't noticed when I entered the room. I don't know when he came in, or if he was in the room all along.

He was not dressed in fancy clothes like the other guests, but in a simple but expensive looking fabric.

The man listened to the host for a while, and finally handed him a long, thin piece of cloth.

You will be able to taste better if you close your vision.

"Yes!　Yes, by all means, I'll do that!"

The host accepted the cloth with great reluctance.

Before I could resist, the cloth was wrapped around my eyes and tied at the back of my head.

The fact that I couldn't see anything made me even more terrified.

The only sound was my heartbeat.

I could tell that the servants who were restraining my body were moving away, but I couldn't see my surroundings, so I didn't feel like running away.

I was confused for a while in the darkness, but then I was grabbed by something soft and hard.

"Come on, Tico. Go ahead and lick your brother. Be gentle so you don't hurt him."

The warm, pulsing thing in his hand seemed to be Kianes' cock.

It was incredibly hot and indescribably soft, but it felt like there was a hardness lurking inside that was never going to break.

"Kianes, I won't hurt you, just be patient. ......"

I stroked his cock with my fingertips and searched for the tip.

It seems to be a bit bigger than when I saw it earlier, but maybe that's why it's so painful.

I reached out my tongue and placed my cock on it.

"Mmm."

I think it was because I couldn't see anything.

I could tell from the feel of my tongue that Kianes' cock had gotten even harder.

I licked the tip of his cock in a motion similar to a rabbit licking a human hand.

I could smell the faint odor of pee, but it didn't smell bad.

I was a little relieved, and hoped that the men around me would hurry up and give me the signal to finish.

As I rolled my tongue around the cock, the taste began to seep out.

It was a little sour.

The host said it would subside with licking, but the more I licked, the harder and bigger the cock got.

Unlike with Kianes, the men around me didn't give me any instructions on how to lick.

I began to worry that I was licking the wrong way, so I tried licking slowly, or concentrating on the striations on the underside.

As I carefully licked the groove between the tip and the rod, the cock swelled up surprisingly.

Then the cock suddenly plunged deep into my throat.

And then, with a tremendous rush, a warm liquid shot into my mouth.

It was pee.

I judged that immediately.

"Ptuu-!　Guughh!"

I opened my mouth and spit it out, but it wasn't watery like pee, it was sticky like glue that stuck to my mouth.

The sticky liquid dripped down my chin.

"Ugh!　What the hell is this ......?　It stinks. ......!"

A very strong smell that I've never smelled before hit my nose.

What the hell is this?

I couldn't see anything because I was still blindfolded, but at least it wasn't pee.

I'm not sure if the thing I was licking earlier was really a penis or not.

"Oh ...... Ugh, stop it ...... Kianes ......."

When I moved my hand to remove the blindfold, it was interrupted by a hand holding it.

"Oh!"

And then a finger was placed on my crotch.

"You can't do that. ...... Please don't do that. ...... Oh, no. ......"

My crotch was very slippery from the tongue licking I had just received.

The fingers used the wetness to their advantage and stroked the center of my crotch and around it.

"Nngh ...... stop, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ......"

The rubbing and crushing of the fingers made me uneasy.

I felt a creeping sensation in my chest and stomach and wanted to let it all out.

It was a strange sensation that I had never experienced before, and it was very scary.

"Mmmm, yuck, yuck...... stop, yuck......"

When I turned away, a hand was placed on my waist.

"Oh, ...... Kianes, could it be that you're being ...... ordered to ......?"

Kianes has been silent since a while ago, but maybe he's being ordered by his servants to be silent.

I don't even want to think about it, but there's a knife in my hand right now. ......

Just thinking about it made my heart shrink.

There was no way that Kianes would like to play with my body. I decided not to think about it anymore.

"......"

I felt something pressing against my crotch.

Because of the tongue licking and fingers touching me, I couldn't tell what it was.

Suddenly, an unusual pain shot through me.

I thought my skin was ripped open.

I felt as if my skin had been ripped open, and then a dull pain started spewing out from my groin to my stomach.

I felt such a tight feeling, as if there was some foreign object inside my body.

"Ow, ow, ow!　Kianes!　It hurts!　I'm being stabbed!　The knife!　There's a knife in me!　Help me!　It hurts!"

I thought of the knife that had been pressed against my neck earlier.

I wondered if the knife had pierced my crotch.

When I reached out to check it, I found a warm stick sticking into my crotch.

"What?　What?　What? A cock......?　Kianes!"

The touch was the feel of the root of his cock.

She had licked it earlier, grasping the base, so her fingers still remembered the feeling.

"There's a penis in there!　What the hell?

I checked with my fingers and found that more than half of his cock was inside me.

I felt like this was something I shouldn't be doing, and a feeling of guilt welled up inside me.

I tried to move my body to get away from the cock, but Kianes was on top of me as if to prevent me from escaping.

"It hurts!　It hurts!　Kianes, please, it really hurts, please stop!"

I wonder if it's because I'm afraid of Kianes that his body feels bigger than usual.

It was very painful as the cock swelled to pry open my body as it entered deeper.

He put his chin on my shoulder and let out a breath.

"Kianes. ......"

With a hand on my stomach, I try my best to pull Kianes' cock out.

But no matter how many times I tried to pull away, Kianes kept moving his hips to pull his cock back in.

It's hard, it's tight, it hurts, it's hard to breathe.

I just prayed that the pain would end.

"Guuu......"

Kianes let out an inarticulate moan that sounded like he was struggling or enduring something.

Then, with a sudden puff of breath, Kianes laid on my body.

"Kufu...... gu, u......!"

I could feel my back shivering.

My hips pressed down on him as if to crush me, and his cock penetrated deep into me.

I don't know what it is, but that seems to be the end of Kianes' action.

I noticed the warm liquid dripping from the connection that it started to drip into the groove of my hips.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 128 - Hentai Mansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I pulled my dick out of Tico, a trembling girl with a blindfold on.

It was a grotesque sight, covered in blood from the rupture.

I feel like my ejaculation deflated my meat stick even more.

"Ugh ...... gosh ...... Ki-Kianes, ugh ......."

Tico still thinks she was raped by her brother.

I pulled the blanket over her body so that it covered her entire body.

I wipe my penis, which is wet with semen, love juice and blood, with a cloth that resembles a handkerchief.

I've had a few virgins in my life, but I've never seen so much blood.

The blanket was quivering and quivering, and I couldn't help but love it.

I adjusted my clothes and decided to leave the room.

This is the mansion of the perverted merchant who was engaged to Kohari, the perverted mansion.

This afternoon, the perverted merchant had come to the house under the guise of an apology, and had brought a huge amount of gold coins as a bribe.

It was more than just an apology for wooing Kohari, or selling face or flattery to the mayor as a merchant.

According to the civil official, the perverted merchant was likely to have found out somewhere that the city side was suspected of tax evasion.

I thought for a moment that if he was found out, he could just run away, but if he made such a move, the civil servants would lead an army with big smiles on their faces and launch a raid.

The perverted merchant, in desperate need of a way out, took a once-in-a-lifetime gamble to bribe me, the ruler, to let him off the hook for tax evasion.

Unfortunately for the perverted merchant, I was not in need of money.

Besides, considering that I would eventually become the head of the Quardenze family, it would be better in the long run to confiscate some of my wealth for tax evasion than to take bribes when I was not the head of the family.

I have enough hidden wealth to not be able to bribe a large amount of gold coins.

The perverted merchant was visibly dismayed by my refusal to accept the bribe.

If I couldn't convince him, there was nothing left for me to do, and he was desperate.

That's when the secret club came into play.

The pervert merchant said that he had set up a members-only club and was holding erotic fun parties with the influential people behind the scenes in Nambonan City.

The club attracts the most beautiful women, and the members are invited to indulge their sexual tastes and watch a show that embodies sexual promiscuity.

Rich people, secret erotic clubs, and free access to women.

I was intrigued by these exciting keywords and decided to accept the invitation to the secret club.

With no intention of allowing tax evasion, I visited the perverted house with a few civil servants and a Rumon.

Rumon was forced to join us because he was acquainted with the perverted merchant and also knew the inside of the perverted house.

When we arrived, the main show of the night was just about to start.

Before the show started, I asked the pervert merchant about the content of the show, and he explained that the purpose of the show was to force an older sister and younger brother to have sex, and then everyone would masturbate to the scene.

I have no idea why the show ends with masturbation when there are cute girls in it.

"Everyone is already tired of having normal sex. ...... ...... A brother who tries to protect his sister is defeated by unreasonable violence and rapes the sister he is supposed to protect. Covered in frustration and humiliation, the meat stick slithers irrelevantly and pierces her sister's innocence. I don't want to do this, but my sister's female body comfortably stimulates my brother's ...... hahah! Isn't it really, really a wonderful sight?　It will be much more exciting than doing it yourself!"

He was truly a perverted merchant.

I couldn't sympathize with him, but it would be a shame to come all the way to the perverted mansion and end up without a visit.

After the show was over, I planned to move my army to take control of the mansion, seize the evidence of tax evasion, and confiscate the hidden assets.

What I hadn't planned on was that Tico, the star of the show, was the type of girl that would make me squirm.

As I watched her voice quivering in response to her brother's cunnilingus, my cock grew hard with the need for sex.

I had Tico blindfolded, and then kicked all the other guests out of the perverted room to enjoy her sister's mistaken belief that she was being raped by her brother.

Tico seemed to think I was her brother until the very end.

I don't think she ever hugged her brother in the normal position, much less gave him a blowjob, so she probably didn't notice.

Above all, the atmosphere of the room must have robbed Tico of her ability to make normal judgments.

There was no way she could judge her brother by touch in such a situation, deprived of her vision.

As she had thought when she had crawled into Kohari's room at night, having sex while being mistaken for someone else was immoral and very exciting.

I think I'll become addicted to it.

"Young Master, the control is complete. We are now looking for evidence of tax evasion.

"Well, thank you."

The civil official, who was waiting just outside the pervert room, saw me and straightened his posture before saying.

It seems that while I was enjoying Tico's body, the pervert house was safely under control.

The owner of the place, the pervert merchant, as well as the servants of the mansion, and even the unlucky ones who happened to be guests, are all in custody for now.

"And I have a report for you. It seems that the women being held here are not slaves, but commoners who were forcibly brought here by kidnappers."

"Huh?"

There are slaves in the Luo continent. They are like livestock that are bought and sold for money and are expected to provide labor.

Slaves like Eve are the exception among exceptions.

There are many territories that prohibit the kidnapping of innocent commoners living in the same territory and selling them off as slaves.

The Quardenze territory is the same as other territories in this area, and it does not allow someone with armed forces to forcibly capture its citizens and sell them as slaves.

Moreover, if such a thing were allowed, the security of the territory would be in a terrible state. The end-of-the-century domain of Quardenze was born.

From the ruler's point of view, the commoners living in his domain, the fiefdoms, are like a kind of property. They cultivate the farmland to produce grain, engage in economic activities to pay taxes, produce things necessary for daily life, and can be conscripted in times of war. That is the people.

When a lord protects his people, it is the same as protecting his own property.

A lord without power who cannot even protect his own property will eventually be abandoned by his people.

It is only natural to prohibit the sale of slaves to those who have been captured by unjust violence.

So how do slavers get slaves?

Except for the illegal ones, there are two main ways: either from the lord's side or by peddling.

In the case of purchasing from the lord, there is a clear example in the territory of Oldentse.

Since my grandfather was involved in wars of aggression against the Imperial nobility, he had many opportunities to acquire prisoners of war.

There are no rules regarding the treatment of commoner prisoners of war, and they are left to the discretion of each individual.

This is why slavers who have connections with their grandfathers, fathers, and knightly families who are participating in the war are able to purchase large quantities of slaves. The slaves are shipped directly from the place of production, and are made in the Imperial noble territory.

It's a good thing that the slavers in New Nellie City are able to protect the people of the Quadrant, but they don't care what happens to the people of the enemy territory.

The slave trade in New Nellie City has been booming for the past few years, but that's because my grandfather regularly wholesales captives to the slave traders.

With a steady source of slaves at their fingertips, the slavers of New Nelly City would not be able to sleep with their feet on Grandfather's back.

In the case of other territories that are not at war, only a portion of the criminals can be sold off to the slavers, so the supply is small and unstable.

Another major source of supply is the peddling of commoners.

Economically impoverished commoners come to sell themselves or their pre-adult children in order to give money to their families.

This is a kind of forced labor contract where slaves are freed after working for a set number of years.

Many territories have this system of selling as a privilege.

The lord sells the "right to purchase commoners" to slave traders as a privilege. With this privilege, the slavers are allowed to deal with the commoners who come to sell themselves.

Rather than selling slaves like livestock, the role of the slave trader is more as a mediator of labor.

The distribution system for slaves is like this for most of the territories.

Basically, merchants who are mainly engaged in the former often travel in search of war-torn lands, while those who are mainly engaged in the latter are often members of local merchant associations.

From a principled point of view, it is not the case that good lords and ladies are suddenly kidnapped one day and sold off to local slave traders.

In reality, bandits and thieves purchase kidnapped territories and distribute them as slaves, and there are also merchants who accept peddlers even though they have not obtained the rights.

As a matter of course, such people are strictly punished.

It seems that most of the people are from the old Voistra and Evenapis territories, but there were also people from the Quardenze territory.

"Hmm. The merchant said that all the women in the house were slaves, but it seems that he was lying.

If you take the proper procedures, you are allowed to buy slaves and force the slaves you buy to play perverted games.

Even if they were not slaves, there was still room for excuse if they had simply kidnapped the people of the former Voistra, a hostile territory. But if the people of Evenapis and Quardenze were mixed in, they were completely out of the picture.

"I'll be back. We'll protect all the women for now. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what to do."

"Ha!"

If Tico was cute, there is a possibility that the other women are cute too.

If I can raise my stock in the company by making them behave like gentlemen, it might make it easier to get into bed with them later.

"Rumon, I don't think you'll have anything left to do. Go back to the mayor's mansion and get ready to receive the women we protected."

The soldiers have already surrounded the pervert house and started to search it with manpower.

The civilian officials belonging to the Quardenze army are busy giving instructions to the soldiers, but Rumon, who is only a city official, can only watch.

After finishing the explanation of the perverted house, Rumon stood in the corridor, looking uncomfortable because he had no authority to give instructions to the soldiers.

"Um, what about the girl in this room?"

"I'll take her. You take the other girls and Tico's brother."

When Tico was blindfolded, Kianes was blindfolded as well.

The civilian said that blindfolded people do not scream unnecessarily. It was knowledge that might be useful in torture or something.

Then Kianes was escorted out of the room by the servants of the pervert's house, followed by the other guests, the pervert merchant, the civil servant and the Rumon.

I didn't know where Kianes was now, and I wasn't interested.

He would leave the boy's care to Rumon.

"All right, I'll take him with the other women."

Rumon bowed crisply and disappeared down the corridor at a run.

I entered the pervert's room again with my civil servant.

Tico seemed to have recovered from her stupor and was sitting on the sofa in a daze.

The blindfold was no longer on her face, and her wisteria eyes were exposed.

I hadn't noticed it when I held her earlier, but her big, bright eyes were adorable.

"Hello......!　Who's ......?

From her reaction, I judged that she hadn't been exposed to the fact that I had stuck my dick in her just a moment ago.

While answering Tico's question, the officer explained that he had come to rescue the women who had been held captive.

"Ah, ....... Sir Knight's soldiers, is it?"

It's not uncommon for noblemen to rule rural areas, so for commoners who don't live in cities, the first thing that comes to mind when they think of a great man is a knight.

"You fool!　This person is ...... of the Quardenze family."

"I'm not a knight, but I'm on the side of the lords, no need to worry. Come on."

I gave her a fresh smile, but she didn't get up.

I wonder if she's wary because she was once caught by kidnappers.

I don't think I'll be mistaken for a pervert in this life because my face is more masculine than in my previous life.

'...... Um, what about my brother?　I'm not sure what to do.　I have a younger brother. ......"

Apparently, she was worried about her brother.

It seems that Tico's brain is even firmly thinking about Kianes.

"We'll protect all the captives. If Tico has a brother, he can meet him if he follows me."

"Thank God. ......"

After exhaling, Tico tried to get up.

As she did, the blanket almost fell off, and I caught a glimpse of her small breasts through the fabric.

I was very careful not to make an erotic face as I pulled the blanket back over Tico.

"I'm sure you're cold, take this blanket with you. It's been hard on ....... You'll be fine."

"Oh, ....... Yes, ......!

It was mainly me who had given Tico a hard time this evening, but I didn't show it.

I could feel the innocence of a young girl's face as she stared at me, red-faced, and my cock, which had just ejaculated twice, was about to get hard again.

The next morning, I was in the mayor's office when I received a report from the civil servants who had been up all night.

After I returned to the mayor's mansion with Tico, the civil servants continued to investigate the perverted house throughout the night.

It seems to have settled down around dawn, and several civil servants came back to the mayor's mansion after my breakfast.

"Thank you for your hard work. It looks like you've been accumulating a lot of money."

The civil servants had compiled a list of hidden assets. It was clear that he had amassed a considerable amount of money.

Apparently, they had been evading taxes long before the annexation of the Quadrant.

And here is where the captive women came from.

The document he handed me listed the names of the abducted women and their hometowns.

It seems that they were intensively hunting refugees from the former Voistra and Evenapis territories who were trying to settle in Nambonan City. Most of them were from these territories.

There were only a few people from the Quardenze territory.

The women who they got tired of playing with were killed and swept away by the river. I've talked to several servants, and I'd say at least ten of them have been killed.

"They're unbelievable, aren't they?"

"Yes, absolutely. I'll prepare a list as soon as the ...... interrogations are over."

The list the civil servant was referring to was a list of executions.

The perverted merchant and his gang were no longer going to avoid execution, but they were big merchants with a good name in Nambonan City.

In order to avoid any trouble later on, a responsible person like a nobleman or a knight must make sure that they are executed properly.

"Mayor, if I may?"

Then Rumon, who was taking over with the civil servant in the corner of the room, raised his hand.

I silently moved my hand and allowed him to speak.

"I think we should make a big announcement about this matter in the city."

According to Rumon, there is no small amount of unrest among the citizens over the military's attack on the city's merchants.

They wondered what had happened to the merchants that the army had suddenly attacked them, whether this kind of thing would continue, and whether the army had turned its attention to the merchants, who had a lot of wealth, and was trying to curry favor with them. It seems that such vague fears are spreading.

"Let's bring to the public's ears the fact that they kidnapped innocent people, treated them like slaves, and even killed more than ten of them. As for tax evasion, that can wait."

"It all started with the tax evasion allegations, remember?"

The civilian interjected at Rumon's suggestion.

"The important thing is the impression of the citizens. ...... A nobleman who ran an army without allowing tax evasion, and a nobleman who ran an army without allowing unethical behavior. From the citizens' point of view, the former leaves them uneasy, while the latter brings them relief."

"What do you mean?"

The officer didn't seem to understand what Rumon was trying to say.

But I had a feeling that I understood.

If you announce that you are going to be executed for tax evasion, the commoners will not be able to think of it as someone else's problem, because they also pay taxes.

It would be as if they were saying, "If you evade taxes, this will happen to you too! It would be as if they were being told, "If you evade taxes, you will be subject to this too!

After all, the amount of taxation is at the discretion of the rulers. This seems to be quite unsettling.

Then, what would happen if you announced that you were going to execute an innocent person for kidnapping and murder?

Commoners are much more likely to be victims of heinous crimes like kidnapping and murder than to be perpetrators.

The fact that they were protected from the possibility of becoming victims, I think this is something that can be viewed favorably.

It is a good thing for good citizens to know that big merchants who seem to be able to escape detection by giving bribes are being punished in the name of justice.

The women who were actually victims were all beautiful looking girls, and the evil deeds of the perverted merchants would be well communicated.

"...... and that's about it?"

I told him exactly what I was thinking, and Rumon rolled his eyes and nodded.

"Yes, I do. I'm familiar with ...... civic sentiment."

It's no wonder I was a commoner in my previous life.

Rumon took a breather and continued.

"It would be better to announce that we have defeated and brought to justice those who are against the ways of humanity, for the same reasons that the ...... mayor mentioned. As for the tax evasion, we can just pretend that we stumbled upon it in the process of defeating them."

The perverted merchant had always had a bad reputation in the city, so there was not much sympathy for him to begin with.

But Rumon said that he was afraid that only a part of the truth, that the noblemen had suddenly hanged the citizens, might go unnoticed.

There is no possibility that the truth, like a small snowball, will roll around the city, take in the vague snow of anxiety, grow into a big snowball, and eventually be distorted into a story that the nobles ran the army because the commoners would not pay.

"The citizens need a clear and simple conclusion. It will ease the anxiety of the citizens."

He said that it would be better to determine the gist of the case by first focusing on the abduction and murder in a big way.

That way, there will be no room for gossip that the perverted merchants were unjustly attacked.

Because this is a case of overthrowing an unethical merchant, and the tax evasion is an added bonus.

Someone may say, "It was a nobleman's conspiracy!　The real purpose was to steal their wealth! No, no, that was a case of justice against a merchant who had repeatedly kidnapped and abducted people.

"...... Rumon .... "

"That merchant was after your sister, wasn't he?　Isn't that a little bit of a personal vendetta?"

The civilian officer was a little taken back by Rumon's manner of not only focusing on the emotions of the citizens, but also thinking of manipulating them.

For nobles, knights, and those on the ruling side, the popularity of the common people is not that important. The only thing they care about is making sure that there is no rebellion.

"I just can't forgive the fact that the great merchants of Nambonan City were committing such vile and treasonous crimes. If it's a ...... personal grudge, consider it the property of all good Nambonan citizens."

"It's outrageous."

Rumon let out a sigh.

This was Rumon, but there was no compassion in his treatment of the perverted merchant, and he seemed to be dealing with the situation rationally, thinking only of efficiency.

The "show where his precious sister was raped" at the pervert's house may have stimulated Rumon's trauma.

Did he see himself in Kianes, or Kohari in Tico?

"It would also serve as a warning to any merchants who might try to do something shady. If we can gain the support of the citizens, it will be easier to run the city in the future. There's no harm in doing it, and I'm worried about the impact if we don't do it. Mr. Mayor, please give it some thought."

I agree with Rumon's opinion that we should use the incident effectively for the future.

And for me, it feels better to be popular than unpopular.

"Okay, then, Rumon, I'll leave it to you to come up with the idea. I'll give you a few people to work with, and you can do whatever you want. If you produce results, you don't have to pay them back."

"......!"

In response to my words, it was the civil servants who let out their voices first.

Rumon is highly regarded by civil servants.

In addition to his high individual ability, accurate and quick work, he is well versed in Nambonan City and the ideas of the merchants, which makes him a valuable asset.

Recently, he seems to be interacting not only with civilian officials but also with military officials, so perhaps he is thinking of learning about the military.

Such is the case with Rumon, but at the city hall, he is just an ordinary employee.

He may move with the direction or permission of the civilian officials, but he does not have the authority to take the lead.

The city of Nambonan had until recently defied the Quardenze family, so there was a feeling that it would be better not to give authority to city officials from the city.

The civil servants also did not see the city officials from within the city as rivals for advancement.

I think this is one of the main reasons why Rumon was so popular among civil servants. Because no matter how much credit he get, he will never get promoted.

"Oh ...... thank you!　I will definitely do my best to satisfy the mayor!"

Rumon thanked me, almost falling to his knees on the spot.

To put it simply, I've given Rumon a chance to move up in the world. If he could successfully complete the project, he would be able to make the personnel attached to him his subordinate.

He didn't expect that someone from the city would be promoted, and the civilian officials in the room all tightened their faces.

My father told me that I could rule as I pleased, so I decided to let him.

The only reason why people from the city don't get promoted is because of the atmosphere, but there is no other reason.

As for me, I want people who are capable and trustworthy to be in a place where they can play an active role commensurate with their abilities.

It would make things easier for me, and it would help Nambonan City grow.

Besides, if Rumon, who's been working so hard, remains in the same position, the motivation of the other staff members will decrease.

"If you have any problems, talk to the civilian officials, they will be able to give you good advice."

"Yes, sir. I'm not familiar with the military, so I'll be relying on them."

I'll check with the civil servants to make sure that we don't start squashing each other with our trivial rivalries.

Any civil officer from a knight family will not interfere.

The knight family must never do anything that goes against the noble family, which is the master. This is what their parents and families instilled in them from an early age.

"You guys, I'm counting on you."

"Yes sir!"

When I turned my gaze to the civil servant and said, I received a very good reply.

After all, people from knightly families are easy to understand.

If non-military personnel can see that there are opportunities for advancement, they will become more active, and this will be a good stimulus for civilian officials.

The civil servants from the knightly families are excellent, but they tend to see things from the perspective of the rulers.

I was hoping that this incident would be a good opportunity for more civil servants to learn about the citizens.

I don't mean to say that they should listen to what the citizens think, but I want them to grow up to be civil servants who can control what the citizens think.

"Young Master, what shall we do with the property of the mansion?　There are many assets that cannot be easily disposed of."

It is important to get rid of the merchant, but we also have to think about the rest of the house.

The civil servants were the first to speak up.

I can feel their eagerness not to give up the remaining work.

"Oh, by the way, there was a lot of art in that mansion. ......"

I have a collection room at New Nellie Castle.

I collect everything from paintings and sculptures to jewelry, precious books, tapestries, carpets, and ceramics. The addition of a silver coin commemorating the founding of the Zinkhaen Empire to his collection is fresh in his mind.

When I think about my previous life in Japan, I can't help but collect them because they all look like masterpieces that could be displayed in a museum or art gallery.

Even if I don't actively work for the collection, merchants from all over the place who want to do business with the pioneer society leave their masterpieces and curiosities, saying that they are just a greeting.

The servants would take care of the cleaning and upkeep, so no matter how much the number of items increased, I would not have to worry about it, which spurred me to collect more.

"Young Master, I know someone who is skilled in the handling of art."

"Who?"

If it's to be transported to New Nelly City, I think it needs to be done carefully. If we send it with other cargo, some rough soldiers might destroy the valuable artworks.

Certainly, if we were going to transport a large amount of art, we would want professional supervision.

I was already planning to send a letter to my father asking him to give me the confiscated artworks, so it was just the right offer.

"All right, I'll leave it to you when my father gives me the go-ahead."

"Ha!"

It was good to have someone who was willing to take the initiative.

I'll just have to be careful that the word "death from overwork" doesn't come over from Earth.

Chapter 129 - The Erect Older Brother
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A/N: This is the story of Rumon, who received the money for the brothel in episode 89.

It's a story about going to a brothel, but there are no erotic scenes.

After taking a break from work, I came to the break room of the mayor's residence.

There was no one else in the room, so I sat down in the sunniest seat and had a cup of tea.

This room, which was prepared at the mayor's request, had been my room before the war, so I felt at ease.

"Hey, are you Rumon?"

I turned around, feeling slightly nervous at the unfamiliar voice, and saw one of the soldiers standing there.

I could tell he was a military officer by his huge muscular physique that was visible even through his thick winter clothes, the good-looking sword on his hip, and the gaudily dyed cloak and ornaments.

"Yes, I'm Rumon."

When you're dealing with a military officer of the Quardenze army, you can't afford to be inept.

I took a bracing posture of courtesy and tried to figure out who he was.

He was about the same age as me, or maybe a little younger.

He had a pleasant, mild-mannered face, but his dark eyes were very serious, as if he was looking right at me.

"What kind of woman do you like?"

"What?"

The question was so unexpected that it came out of my throat like a flood.

"What?　The young master asked me to come to ....... You're the one going to the brothel, right?"

"...... it's me."

A few moments ago, I received a few silver coins from the mayor.

I would have liked to buy something for Kohari, but he had given them to me as money for the brothel.

Since it was a gift from the mayor, I was afraid to use it for any other purpose. If I did so, I might be accused of stepping on the mayor's kindness.

I have never been to a brothel in my life. ...... In the first place, I have no experience with women.

That's why I was so confused when I received the silver coin.

The mayor said he would call someone who was familiar with brothels later, but he didn't expect such a well-placed military officer to come.

"That's good. Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Leahlight, and as you can see, I'm a soldier in the military of Quardenze."

He smiled with a toothy grin and said his name was Leahlight.

I took the time to return the greeting in a polite and relaxed manner, while my mind did its best to recall the name.

He was a military officer in the military of the Quardenze, and his name was Leahlight.

The name sounded familiar.

"......, are you the Leahlight of House Gatoren?"

"Oh, you do have some knowledge, don't you?　Indeed, I am Gatoren Leahlight."

The knightly family of Gatoren has a long history in the Quardenze territory.

He rules the city of Gatoren, which is not as large as New Nelly City, but is certainly the second largest in the territory.

However, now that Nambonan City has become part of the Quardenze territory, there is no guarantee that it will be able to keep its position in the future.

"Well, even so, one of my brothers will take over the house. You don't have to be so awed."

"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Leahlight."

I'm not going to give a bad impression to the Gatoren family, who are the top knights serving the Quardenze family.

"Oh come on, we're going to a whorehouse and you can't be so shrill. Don't call me Mr. Leahlight."

Mr. Leahlight put his hand on his chin and continued with a troubled expression.

"Let's go to the brothel for now. The young master gave me some money for the brothel because I was assigned to guide the Rumon. It's a good deal."

"Ha, ha. I'm glad to hear that."

"Now we can go to the best place today!"

With a slap on the back, Mr. Leahlight and I were about to leave the break room.

As we were pushed out of the room from behind, we almost bumped into someone walking towards us.

"Brother?"

The person I almost bumped into was Kohari, who was probably in the middle of doing some chores and was holding a stack of papers in his hand.

"Kohari. What's wrong?"

I felt a cold sweat break out on my back.

I didn't want Kohari to see me going to the brothel.

"I'm going back to my room to study. I heard that Ms. Odie is going to have a recruitment test for junior servants, so I'll take it. That way you will get more money, brother."

"Ah. Do your best."

"Yes, you'll see how I do soon!"

Kohari smiled at me, a pretty smile that made me smile like a flower, and walked quietly down the corridor.

I had heard that Master Tesh and Master Odie were making preparations to hire a junior servant.

But I had never thought that Kohari would be interested in applying.

I was excited to see how much the doll-like Kohari had grown, but at the same time, I felt that she was still out of touch with the common sense of the world, which made me smile.

It's impossible to hire a girl who wants to be a junior servant when she calls Master Odie, a senior servant, "Ms. Odie" without hesitation.

Kohari has become the mayor's favorite and is being given special treatment by Lady Odie, but she doesn't seem to understand this.

Besides, Kohari, who was almost certain to become the concubine of the mayor, or in other words, a nobleman, would never become a low-ranking servant.

Although Kohari didn't seem to notice, Lady Odie didn't look too happy about her preoccupation with scullery work.

She seems to think that she should be more aware of her role as the mayor's concubine, have more feminine hobbies, and try to conceive a child.

Lady Odie is like a woman from a knightly family, strict and relentless.

When I saw Kohari looking so carefree in front of Master Odie, it made me nervous.

The reason why Lady Odie is so lenient with Kohari is because the mayor allows it. Kohari is currently in a very privileged environment.

I still can't forgive the mayor for forcibly raping Kohari, but the fact that he is now at peace makes me think that it is a good thing.

The number of smiles on Kohari's face is much greater than it was when we were merchants.

"Is that Rumon's sister?　She's so beautiful."

"Yes. Thanks to you, the mayor will be pleased to hear that."

Mr. Leahlight's eyes were tinged with a fondness for me, so I decided to nail him early.

If you mention the mayor's name, the son of the Gatoren, who are famous for their loyalty, will never touch you, and if anything happens to Kohari, he will actively protect you.

"Hey, did you think I'd mess with that little sister of yours?　It's a known fact in the military. It's a known fact in the army that you can't mess with the young master's girl.

"Is that so?"

"Yeah," Mr. Leahlight nodded.

I've heard that male nobles tend to cherish the women they like. Considering the mayor's way of speaking and the fact that the military had been made aware of it, it was safe to assume that Kohari's safety had been guaranteed.

I felt a renewed sense of relief, and my shoulders relaxed.

"Oh?　You're relaxing? It's just the beginning, isn't it?　Let's hurry up and go see those cute girls."

I followed Mr. Leahlight out the door.

The mayor had recommended him as a whorehouse enthusiast, and he was well versed in the affairs of the lower half of the body in Nambonan.

Born and raised in Nambonan, he definitely knew more than I did. I wonder how much he likes brothels.

"So, Rumon, what kind of women do you like?"

"Well, you know, ......."

I hadn't really talked about this kind of thing before, so I couldn't help but hesitate. He was the son of a knightly family, after all.

"Don't be shy. Would you rather be older or younger?　Do you prefer a woman with skills?　Or do you prefer a new girl?　Which do you prefer, a woman with a big butt or a big chest?"

"...... What kind of woman do you like, Mr. Leahlight?"

Mr. Leahlight is apparently two years younger than I am.

He prefers older women with breasts, a strong personality and reddish hair. I feel that she is somewhat similar to Lady Odie.

And as I said before, please don't call me Mr. Leahlight. I don't like that kind of thing. I don't like that kind of thing, it's the reason why I ran away from home a long time ago.

"When you say "home," do you mean the Gatoren family?"

"That family has been nagging me about everything, telling me I don't have enough self-awareness as a child of a knightly family and whatnot. My brother is going to take over the family, and I don't need to be told that."

If you hear the name of the Gatoren family, the word "loyalty" is the first thing that comes to mind, a knightly family.

"I see, so that's why you belong to the Quardenze army."

If you're the son of a knight family and you want to pursue a career in the military, you'll often join either your family's army, the knight army, or the army of the lord nobleman.

It would be easier for them to escape the interference of their parents if they joined the Quardenze army.

"I'm a Quardenze soldier now. A while ago I was a mercenary outside the territory."

"Well, what can I say about that? ...... Is such a thing allowed in a knightly family child?　Isn't that a very unconventional way to live ......?"

"I've heard that a lot," Leahlight said, laughing out loud. His voice echoed well in the city's main streets.

I've never heard of a child of a knight family becoming a mercenary, so it seems to be a special case.

I wondered if it was his experience as a mercenary that gave him an air of friendliness despite being a military officer.

"The house will be fine even if I'm not there because my brother is around a lot."

"I see. ......"

I've always admired General Galfis and wanted to spend my life fighting. I was treated well wherever I went because of my magical powers. I traveled all over the continent.

General Galfis, who is in charge of the defense of Nambonan City, spent his childhood in battle and made a name for himself with his bravery.

According to Mr. Leahlight, the boys of the knightly family admire the anecdotes of General Galfis when he was young.

"A trip around the continent? To what regions?"

I had only been to the imperial capital and the royal capital at most, so the trip sounded very interesting to me.

"The southern part of the continent. There are a number of city-states, right?　There are a lot of skirmishes, so there was no shortage of mercenary work."

As he said this, Mr. Leahlight named some of the cities where he had worked as a mercenary.

Some of the cities were well known, while others were so small that you had to review a map to find their location.

"I also participated in the Gulf Cities Unification War, do you know it?"

"The Ricarda Confederacy?"

There were several city-states in the Gulf region in the southernmost part of the continent, but the war started about ten years ago and they finally became one.

Even if you check their territories on a map, they are small states with territories not much different from the great nobles of the Kingdom of Levios or the Zinkhaen Empire.

The new nation is called the Confederacy of Ricarda.

"That's it. I used to be a mercenary there. At the end of the war, I led a unit of about 8,000 people, and after the war, I was so active that they asked me to become a knight there. Isn't that amazing?"

It seemed more like an employed knight than a mercenary;

A man raised in a knight's family and a mere mercenary may still have a difference in self-power.

"It's great, but ...... why are you in the Quardenze army now?　You had the opportunity to officially become a knight, didn't you?"

Earlier, Mr. Leahlight had mentioned something about not being able to inherit the family name because he had many older brothers.

It would be a great opportunity for him to become a knight, as he could not inherit the Gatoren family.

"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. ...... No, it won't just be my dad, my brothers will all come aboard. I'm going to kill the disgrace of the Gatoren family!　...... or something like that."

"What?　Why?

From my point of view, if a son who is low in the line of succession to the heir becomes a knight somewhere, it would be to the benefit of that family.

If my son becomes a knight in the Ricarda Confederacy in the southern part of the continent, he can make a fortune through trade and quickly grasp the situation in the south.

Why, of course?　The Gatoren's lord is the Quardenze family. If you are only hired temporarily as a mercenary, it is ...... shameful to change your family name and have another monarch.

"Is that how it is ......?"

"Because of the Quardenze family, the Gatoren family exists, and because of the Gatoren family, I was born as a person with magical powers, and as a result, I was able to take credit for the war. It seems that Mr. Leahlight has that kind of thought process."

"I see. If that's the way he thinks, he can't do anything like switching from the Quardenze family."

I knew that knightly families had this way of thinking, but I think I understood it for the first time through actual conversation.

"And I don't really want to be a knight. I don't want to be like my father, doing detailed desk work, thinking up policies, I hate it just thinking about it."

"I see."

Mr. Leahlight may be an excellent warrior, but I get the feeling that he is not suited for detailed territory management.

"The city of Nambonan is interesting in that respect. The commoners ran the city with their own representatives, right?"

"Yes. Elections will be held soon and a new representative will be chosen."

Mr. Leahlight, who didn't know how elections worked, asked for an explanation, and I was happy to oblige.

There is no city in the Quadrant that has a governance system similar to that of Nambonan City.

Currently, the system is maintained because the mayor understands it, but there is no guarantee that it will remain so in the future.

In order to preserve the autonomy of Nambonan, we need to make the rulers understand that this autonomy is the source of Nambonan's vitality.

Forgetting that I was in the middle of going to a brothel, I gave an impassioned speech to Mr. Leahlight.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 130 - Captured Girls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As one of the biggest merchants in Nambonan City used to live there, the perverted mansion is quite magnificent.

He must have hired a good architect when he built it, not to mention the large land area, and it looks like a graceful mansion without the obnoxiousness peculiar to millionaires.

As I passed through the main gate, I saw a row of arched gates made of bricks that resembled an aqueduct.

The gates were probably designed for appearance rather than practicality, and the sight of the gates in the same shape, spaced evenly to the main building, was beautiful enough to make me stop and look.

I hadn't had a chance to take a closer look because it was night when I came to see the pervert show.

Although the pervert merchant was sexually twisted, he did not seem to have bad taste when it came to things around him.

When he stepped into the main building of the pervert's mansion, he found a civil official waiting there.

"Young Master. I've been waiting for you.

A few days had passed since I stepped into the pervert show, and I came to the pervert house again.

The evidence of tax evasion and kidnapping had already been collected, and the Quardenze army had retreated.

"Thank you for welcoming me. What's the progress?

The owner of this mansion is no longer with us. To be precise, he is no longer in this world.

Yesterday afternoon, the evil deeds of the perverted merchant were announced to the citizens, leading to his execution.

Rumon seemed to have done a lot of behind-the-scenes work, and the excitement in the square was tremendous.

As soon as the perverted merchant stepped onto the special stage set up in the square, the surrounding area was filled with shouts of abuse even before the charges were read out.

When I appeared on the stage at the very end, I thought the bricks of the building would collapse from the cheers.

After that, the public announcement ended without a hitch, and Rumon was promoted to the position of having subordinates.

Thus, the perverted mansion, which had lost its owner, became the custody of the Quardenze family.

Incidentally, I was surprised to hear that it was the citizens who started asking for the house to be kept by the mayor. This shows the high level of Rumon's public agitation skills.

The cleaning has been completed and all that remains is to install the furniture. The furniture we ordered in the city will arrive soon, so we expect it to be ready by the end of the day.

"That's pretty fast, huh?　I thought you placed the order a few days ago."

This time, I decided to move part of my living quarters in Nambonan City to the Pervert House.

This is because both Tesh and Odie advised me to do so.

Originally, I had ordered the renovation of the mayor's mansion to accommodate Anna and Kohari as concubines.

I had planned to put their living quarters under my control.

I had planned to add a palace-like facility to the mayor's mansion, but when Tesh and Odie found out that the perverted mansion would be free, they immediately expressed their opinions.

The mayor's mansion is a facility where my living space and the city hall coexist.

Even though the two are separated by the pavilion unit, an unspecified number of men, including civil servants, will be coming and going on the premises.

This was apparently unacceptable to Tesh and Odie. They don't want some insolent man to come in and make a mistake with my Anna or Kohari.

If my mistress's infidelity were to cause me to lose faith in women or become impotent, it would be a matter of great importance to the Quardenze family.

From Tesh and Odie's point of view, it was the worst thing that could happen.

For that reason, if the use of the perverted house had not yet been decided, they were asked to use it as a house to enclose their mistress.

Because of the noble nature of the people around me, I thought it was understandable that they would be worried, and because I had no other ideas on how to use it, I decided to maintain the perverted house as my rear palace.

It seems that the people in the city gave top priority to the work. I guess that's the result of the young master's virtue.

I had a feeling that it was the result of propaganda, but let's just call it my virtue.

And since I had already ordered the beds and other things when I gave the order to rebuild, I guess I didn't start from scratch.

"If you are satisfied with the work done by the citizens of Nambonan, ...... and there are no problems with the quality of the delivered goods, tell the contractor that I said so."

"Yes, sir."

Since he had worked so hard, it would be nice to at least give him a compliment.

A word of praise from the mayor of the day would put the contractors in a good mood, and they would come in handy next time.

"Now, let's see how the captured girls are doing."

"Ha!　I'll show you around."

The purpose of my visit today was to check on the progress of the renovations, but the main purpose was to check on the status of the abducted girls.

The thirty or so girls who were taken into custody are temporarily living in the pervert house until their future treatment is decided.

I wondered if it would be a good idea to let them live in a house with bad memories, but there was no other house that could accommodate almost thirty girls, so I had no choice.

We were led down the corridor by a civil official and into a large room.

As we entered the room, the girls, who had been chatting happily, all looked at us at once.

"Everyone, please refrain. This is the legitimate son of the Quardenze family, Sir Quardenze Wilk."

The women, who probably knew in advance that I was coming to inspect today, were not distraught and all fell to their knees at once.

I told them to relax their posture and sat down on the chairs that had been prepared nearby.

I felt a twinge of embarrassment as my every move was being watched by the girls of my age.

The air in the room, warmed by the fireplace, was laced with the delicious scent of young girls.

I was tempted to take off my clothes and announce the start of a big orgy, but I held back.

Maybe being in a perverted house makes you a pervert. It's a dangerous place.

"Are you having any inconveniences?"

I tried to speak as softly as I could, but the girls were too afraid to say anything.

I looked around at their expressions, but I couldn't see any of them looking uncomfortable at my appearance. They looked like they wanted to reply, but couldn't bring themselves to do so.

They look as if they are worried about not being polite to a nobleman by using bad language.

"...... Tico, how are you doing?　Are you having a hard time with anything?"

"Huh?

The girl next to her looked around in a panic.

The girl next to her saw her demeanor and gestured frantically with her hand for her to respond quickly.

"Oh, um, ......!　Oh no!　And, very!　I'm not struggling!　I'm fine!"

I couldn't help but chuckle at her oddly phrased answer.

Tico's face turned bright red and she covered her face with her hands.

"How about the rest of you?"

Perhaps because of Tico's answer, the other girls seemed to be able to calm down.

All of the girls who had asked the question gave a neat, if stuttering, reply.

The short answer was that they were living without any problems.

"That's good. Take your time to heal."

As I said this, the girls all spoke in uneven tones of gratitude.

It wasn't just a token of gratitude to the nobleman, but it seemed to come from the depths of their hearts.

I turned my gaze to Wenjian and asked him to explain the recent situation.

At first, the girls were quiet, paying attention to the conversation between me and Wenjian, but after a while, one or two of them started to talk in secret.

They must have sensed that we were not to be blamed for their chatter, and soon the room was filled with a lively atmosphere.

Most of the girls were between the ages of 15 and 20, with 13-year-old Tico being the youngest.

Glancing back, I saw that all of the girls were sitting on the floor, chatting and embroidering.

I asked the civil servant about them, and he told me that he had prepared them because the girls had told him that they had nothing to do and wanted to do some domestic work.

Most of the girls were from rural areas, and it seemed like a waste of time to just relax in a room with a fireplace.

Kianes, who is not good at embroidery and is on fireplace duty, has been pacing in and out of the room for a while now. He has some firewood in the backyard.

The sight of nearly thirty girls embroidering in unison in a room with a large fireplace and beautiful, luxurious shapes was quite bizarre.

I broke off my conversation with the civil servant and approached Tico to see how the rural girls were doing with their needles.

Some of the girls were looking at me, but Tico was so focused on her work that she didn't notice my approach at all.

I guess when daughters get together, they naturally form groups of good friends, and Tico was forming a circle with five other girls.

If you looked closely, you could see that one of them was Kohari.

At first, it was a male civil servant who was stationed in the room of the perverted house, but when there were reports that the girls were a bit frightened, he was replaced by Kohari, who was in charge of miscellaneous tasks.

It wasn't like she was going to be stationed there to do any work, but it was judged that she could at least keep an eye on the girls, so she was put in charge.

From the looks of it, she seems to have forgotten all about her work and is enjoying working with the girls now that she has become friends with them.

If this were Rumon, I would think that he was trying to find out their true intentions by getting to know them not as a resident but as a fellow worker. ...... But in Kohli's case, I can only think that she is enjoying herself.

"Are you any good at embroidery?"

"Hiya!"

When I called out to Tico, she jumped up in surprise.

When she sees me, she sticks a needle into a pillow-shaped needle holder and puts her fingers on the floor in a formal position.

"Oh, my God, me!　The embroidery is, well, ......!"

"You don't have to be so nervous. I won't punish you if your speech slips a little."

I casually put my hand on her shoulder and waited for her to calm down, enjoying the sexual harassment to the extent that it didn't become unpleasant.

As if a drunkard had been given a drink, Tico's face quickly turned red, and her wisteria eyes moistened as if the heat from her face had melted them.

The girls nearby were letting out excited squeals as they peered at her.

A situation comes to mind: a girl talking to the senior of her dreams, and her friends cheering her on from afar. It's quite a nice feeling.

"Is this the finished product?　It's beautifully done. Who made this?　Kohari?"

In the center of the circle made by Tico, Kohari and the four girls, there was a finished embroidered cloth.

I picked up one of them and looked at it.

The dark blue cloth with many petals stitched in red and yellow thread reminded me of a fireworks display in a previous life in Japan.

"Oh, ......, it's me, ......."

Tico quietly raised his hand and immediately hid his face in embarrassment.

Her ears, which she hadn't been able to hide, had turned a magnificent shade of red.

"Wow, ......, that's nicely done. Are you familiar with it?"

The threads were sewn in tightly, and to my eyes, it looked well done.

"We have a lot of rabbits in the house, so I'm good with thread."

"Rabbits?"

I couldn't really see the connection between being good at needlework and having rabbits.

The girl sitting right next to Tico must have noticed that I didn't understand, because she opened her mouth.

"The rabbit's hair is used to make thread, so there are many opportunities to embroider with thread that can't be sold. Tico's family keeps rabbits, right?"

"Yes."

I wonder if I look like a naïve aristocrat to them, not knowing how thread is made.

I began to feel that I couldn't make fun of Kohari's ladylike nature too much.

"Tico's family is a rabbit family?"

It's not an occupation I've heard much about, but maybe it's not an uncommon family business in the continent of Eruo.

In both New Nellie City and Nambonan City, rabbit meat soup is rather common on the menu.

I had thought that hunters hunted rabbits, but perhaps rabbit farms are the mainstream way of raising rabbits.

Again, it was the girl sitting next to me who answered my question.

"You know, many farmers keep rabbits in their gardens. The hair can be used to make yarn, the meat is delicious, and even small children can take care of them. Besides, the droppings can be used as fertilizer for the fields. There are many houses that have chickens and rabbits."

"Is that so?"

The girls in the vicinity who had been listening in nodded in agreement with her words.

It seemed that keeping rabbits was a normal thing for farmers.

'You keep rabbits in your house, don't you, Mr. Mayor?　There was a well-fat rabbit."

Tico said with a smile, but I had no idea what she was talking about.

I don't think they raise any livestock in the mayor's mansion.

I was about to ask Tico where she had seen it, when Kohli raised a small hand.

"I think that might be my rabbit. It's a black-haired rabbit. ......"

"Oh, I'm sure it's that rabbit."

I can't believe she had a rabbit. I wonder if she was dabbling in rabbit breeding as an inside job.

It's a little scary to imagine such a young lady, who wouldn't kill a mosquito, strangling and dismembering a rabbit, smiling and saying, "Brother, the fatty thigh meat looks very tasty."

"Did you have a rabbit or something?"

"Yes, I did. Now I can live with them again."

When we talked to Kohari, she told us that they had been keeping rabbits since long before they were annexed to the territory of Quardenze.

His father, who always put his work first, rarely came home, but his older brother, Rumon, was very protective of her.

But that was only until Rumon came of age. As the heir to a large merchant family, Rumon became very busy when he came of age, and many days he did not come home.

Kohari spent her days alone in the house without her family, waiting for Rumon's return.

One day, Rumon brought a baby rabbit back to the house for Kohari, who was feeling lonely, and she was able to drown her sorrows for a little while.

When the house was confiscated by the Quardenze army, the rabbit was left in the care of one of Kohari's few friends.

At that time, Kohari was so sad to say goodbye to the rabbit that she cried endlessly at the inn.

Eventually, Rumon was hired as a city employee, and he was able to live and work in the mayor's mansion.

Recently, he could made enough money to live well, so he got the rabbit back from his friend and decided to keep it at the mayor's residence.

Incidentally, Rumon got the permission to keep the rabbit from Tesh and Odie. He's a very sweet brother to his sister.

In other words, it seems that Kohari's rabbits were not livestock, but pets.

"I've collected their hair and had it made into yarn. I even had them collect the hair and turn it into thread, which turned out to be very beautiful and black."

"One rabbit, huh?　How can you get that much hair?"

I've never touched a rabbit in a previous life on Earth, but I think that one only had hair the size of a cat.

If you collect the hair from a cat's growth, you won't get that much. And I don't think it can be processed into thread.

"The ...... rabbit is a thick-haired rabbit, not like the ones you find in the wild. ......"

The girl sitting next to Tico moves her hands in an Afro-head drawing motion.

This is the first time I've ever seen a thick-haired rabbit.

That fuzzy creature was a rabbit. ......

When I was out and about in New Nellie City, I once saw a domestic animal with the appearance of a hairball being kept in a rural plot.

The people in the farming village called the creature by a word that means "furball" or "hairy" in Luo language, so I thought that there must be strange creatures with such strange names in the Luo continent.

After listening to the girl's explanation in more detail, it seemed that the "furball" in New Nelly City was identical to a creature named the "thick-haired rabbit.

Since there are rabbits that look like rabbits on the continent of Luo, whenever I hear the word rabbit in my brain, I think of that rabbit.

Thick-haired rabbits, also known as furballs, are creatures that have voluminous, sheep-like body hair.

If you include the fuzzy parts, an adult rabbit is bigger than a basketball.

I was allowed to touch a live one in a farming village once, and it was so pleasant to the touch that I wanted to rub its cheeks.

The farmer told us that the hair on their bodies was so thin and strong that they could take the bite of a wild dog.

However, even if they were able to catch a bite attack, they would be sucked into their mouths and taken somewhere else, which means that they will eventually be killed unless humans help them. The thick-haired rabbit is a slow-moving animal.

The thick-haired rabbit is a slow-moving animal, and as each region has its own name for animals, it may be a custom around New Nelly to call it a furball.

"The thick-haired rabbit, as you can see when you shave it, is just a normal rabbit. They just have a lot of hair on them."

"Wow. That's interesting.

I had an image of rabbit hair being used as fur, but considering its sheep-like appearance and her explanation, I guessed she would use scissors or a razor blade to cut off the hair.

However, given its sheep-like appearance and her description, I guess she uses scissors or a razor blade to cut off the hair. It was hard to believe that Kohari was so happy when she tore off the skin of her pet rabbit and said, "Brother, the fur came off beautifully.

"Shaving is fun. Kianes...... my brother is very good at it."

According to Tico and the other girls, thick-haired rabbit hair can be used to make thread that is much finer than sheep's wool.

"You're used to embroidery, aren't you Tico?"

"No, that's not true. Your mother is much better at it than I am."

Tico put one hand on her cheek, as if embarrassed, and averted his gaze.

One of the hobbies of the noble princesses is embroidery.

Fanny also has a needle sometimes, but compared to that, Tico's embroidery is on a much different level.

It may be natural that Tico is a better embroiderer because she is older, but I don't think Fanny will be able to catch up with this level in a few years.

Well, princesses' embroidery is just for fun, so except for a few embroidery nerds, their skills are very limited.

I was once given a handkerchief embroidered by Fanny, and it was a smiling piece of work. Of course, I took it with a smile and played the role of a kind brother.

I took Tico's hand and smiled, "No need to be modest, you look beautiful. If you can sew ...... well, can I have one?"

"Yes.... yes ♡"

Tico was no longer a maiden.

But her eyes were those of a maiden in love.

Chapter 131 - Concubine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A/N: Thank you to Jimmy and Someone for buying me Ko-Fi! In total, there will be 12 (131 - 142) chapters. I will be posting 3 everyday starting from today until the bonus chapters from Ko-Fi are done! Thank you for your patience.

After the inspection of the perverted house, I returned to the mayor's mansion.

I could have relaxed a little longer, but I felt that my lower body would not be able to handle Tico's passionate gaze and the young sexiness of the guardian girls.

The impression that I was a nice nobleman was going well, so if I was going to invite them to my bedroom, I wanted to do it smartly.

When I returned to the mayor's mansion, I instructed Rumon, who was working, to bring me a thick-haired rabbit.

I wanted to make sure it was the same furball I'd seen in New Nellie City before I forgot about it.

Rumon seemed to be accustomed to handling the rabbit, since Kohari had kept it for him, and he seemed to have a good way of holding it.

"Is this the thick-haired Rabbit?　It doesn't have as much hair as I've heard. ......"

"Kohli regularly trims the rabbit's hair because too much hair makes it hard to see what's in front of it. Rabbits in the countryside grow their fur long enough to make fine yarn, so they look different."

I observed the thick-haired rabbit as it sat motionless on the desk.

I could barely make out the rabbit's silhouette, though its fur was thick and voluminous, making it look very round.

The ball of fur I saw in New Nellie City before looked like a rolling cloud of dust, and I couldn't even make out the "U" in rabbit. I think the ears were completely buried, too.

"Is the hair on this going to grow into a furball ......?"

When I opened my palm and touched the fur of the thick-haired rabbit, it felt soft and fine. It's really comfortable.

The densely packed hair was not straight, but curly, similar to wool or cotton.

"A hairball?　...... Oh, that's what some rural people call their rabbits. This rabbit was purchased in a farming village, so if you let the hair grow out, it will look like that."

"I see."




Well, it certainly has the shape of a rabbit.

I wriggled my fingers and dug them into the fur, eventually reaching the skin.

As I groped around the neck and the base of the foot, it seemed to be the shape of a rabbit.

"Does the mayor prefer the fast-moving rabbits that live in the woods and fields?"

"I don't really like them, but ...... they are more like rabbits, aren't they?"

But Rumon, with an indescribably half-hearted expression on his face, gave a vague, caring reply without denying us.

It seems that my view of rabbits is not the same as the people of the continent of Luo.

"I wonder how such a slow-moving rabbit can survive in the harsh natural world. Wouldn't they be devoured by wild dogs?"

The thick-haired rabbit in front of me twitched its long ears every once in a while, barely moving, and I wondered if it would turn into a furball, a mere object.

"The rabbit is a domestic animal and cannot live in the wild. As the mayor said, they can be attacked by dogs and wolves, and they are not very cautious. Even in captivity, they can mess with a snake that enters their hut and die from the venomous fangs of a counterattack."

Compared to the fangs of wild dogs, snakes' fangs are long, thin, and sharp, so they can slip through the hair defense of thick-haired rabbits.

Incidentally, even though there are differences in the types of snakes, poisonous snakes live almost everywhere in the continent of Eruo.

It is one of the most common causes of death for people without magical powers.

The coat of arms of the Quardenze family includes a picture of a snake, which is said to be a poisonous snake that lives widely in the central part of the continent.

It is a snake that looks like a slightly thicker version of a green snake, with metallic green scales that resemble those of a cockatoo. It is smooth and beautiful to look at.

However, it is extremely poisonous, and a single bite from a mere human can paralyze the nerves, rendering the person unable to move, and the person will die from breathing difficulties.

Especially in the summer, it is difficult to see them because they blend in with the green grass, and many people accidentally step on them and get hit back. Every year, many New Nelly citizens are bitten by these snakes and die.

I wonder what the ancestors of the Quardenze family were thinking when they incorporated such a vicious creature into their coat of arms.

"Well ...... be careful with the snake. Kohari will be sad."

"Yes. The hut is in the courtyard, but I will make sure that there is no space for snakes.

This was the end of the conversation, and Rumon gave off that vibe.

But I wanted to know more about the thick-haired rabbit, and I had other things to do.

"Wait a minute. I'll get to the point."

"My apologies."

Rumon apologized for trying to pull up the rabbit without permission, and placed the thick-haired rabbit on the floor, which I had picked up to take home.

I took out a small box from my desk drawer.

This was something that had just arrived from New Nellie City the other day.

After my inspection of the Mana Mine, I had written a letter to Lupetta in response to the letter from New Nellie City.

Although Lupetta was an adventurer with no fixed address, she had mentioned that she would be staying in New Nelly City for a while, so a castle servant could deliver the letter immediately.

In fact, I've sent servants out on errands a few times when sex was called for, so I know the inn where I'm staying is cracked.

"Do you know what this is?"

Inside the small box was one of the mana crystals that had been lent to Lupetta.

It was a good luck charm that I had lent to Lupetta just in case she joined the expedition to New Nelly Field to protect her safety.

It would be useless for her to keep it after she returned from the field expedition, so I contacted her to return it.

"This is ...... the mana crystal I received from my mother."

There were a total of three mana crystals that I had previously confiscated from Rumon.

Two of the items were so-called "mementos" given by the deceased Rumon's mother to her own children, Rumon and Kohari.

The remaining one seemed to have been displayed in the mansion, and there was no one to whom it belonged. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

"...... I see."

It seems that the mana crystal that was lent to Lupetta was given to her by Rumon from her mother.

I couldn't tell which of the three mana crystals belonged to whom at all, so I just showed him the actual crystals and didn't say much.

I seemed to have succeeded in extracting the answer from Rumon.

"Tesh will present you with another gift. But I thought I'd give this to you first."

It has been officially decided that Kohari will be my concubine.

In a sense, this is like a marriage ceremony, so the rest of the family will receive money and goods.

It's not important to know, but in Eruo, both receiving a regular wife and receiving a concubine are often expressed in the same way.

If I were to translate it into Japanese, it would be closer to the native sense to say that Kohari would marry into the Quardenze family.

However, there is not as much hassle as when welcoming a regular wife.

I don't have to do anything, because Tesh and the others around me will take care of everything.

"Mayor?"

"Once you get married, you won't be able to live with her like you used to. ......"

A room for a concubine was prepared at the pervert's mansion, so Kohari's life would be based there.

It was decided that she could continue her menial work at the mayor's mansion until she became pregnant, so it didn't mean that she wouldn't be able to see Rumon. But the chances of that happening will be greatly reduced.

"I'm going to give the crystal to Kohari as a memento. Even if you have to be away from each other more often, having something that shows the bond between siblings will help you feel a little less lonely. ...... Besides, you're now in a position to have subordinates. Take a look at this, brace yourself, and continue to work in a way that would make your late mother proud."

"Mayor ......!"

The next moment, Rumon, who had been posturing, fell to his knees as if he was going to collapse.

"The mayor's kindness ...... makes me truly happy ......!　I will continue to help the mayor ...... and devote myself to the development of Nambonan City and Quardenze!"

Rumon's fingers, shoulders, and voice were shaking with emotion.

The mana crystals were in a small box, but there was no proof that they belonged to Rumon.

Two of the three mana crystals were still in existence, but one had been filed away in an experiment.

Since I was certain that the crystal I was carrying around was Kohari's, there was a 50/50 chance that the missing crystal was Rumon's.

It was fortunate that Rumon's crystal was still there. It was a little awkward to wake up to the fact that he had destroyed a memento.

"That's good."

If Rumon's crystals had disappeared, he assumed that he would have to make some quibble that sounded reasonable and give the remaining crystals to her.

The plan was to say, "You have protected your sister well until now. I'll take responsibility for that thought, along with the crystal as a memento. Rumon, from now on, make a new determination, swear by this crystal, and live to make your late mother proud!"

I was planning to return the memento to Kohari and increase her favorability.

But I was afraid that if I screwed up, she would say something like, "I want you to give my brother back his memento, too. ......"

If Rumon's crystals had disappeared, he would have trouble dealing with them. That's why I decided to make the first move and return the crystals to Rumon.

In addition, it would be profitable if he could elicit the loyalty of Rumon by ostentatiously returning the confiscated items.

"I'm a bit of a fool, but ...... she's my precious little sister and I wouldn't trade her for anything. Please take care of her."

"...... Ah!"

The trembling of Rumon's body stopped immediately, and his serious eyes turned only to me.

I wonder if he feels like a father sending off his daughter.

Of course, I'm going to be very kind to Kohari.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 132 - Eating the daughter of a former merchant family that I've gradually grown to love(1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While I was writing in the mayor's office after taking a bath, there was a small knock on the door.

Judging from the way they knocked, it was not Tesh or Odie.

"Come in."

The person who opened the door without a sound was Kohari, who had changed into a nightgown.

She was dressed in simple clothes that were not at all glamorous like those worn by commoners, and her ladylike demeanor was quite unbalanced.

She was wrapped in a large black cloth over her nightgown to protect her body from the cold, and looked like Count Dracula.

"Oh?　You've come alone?"

I was the one who summoned Kohari, but I forgot to specify that she should come alone. I forgot to specify that she should come alone, so I assumed that Rumon would come along with her anyway.

Surprisingly, however, Kohari seemed to be the only one who came to the mayor's office.

"Yes, sir. My brother told me to go alone.

"Hou ......"

Even with the word "ex" at the beginning, Kohari was still a young lady, a lady-in-waiting, a girl in a box.

She thought that an unmarried woman could not just waltz in here alone when a man called her out for the night.

It was a very serious thing to say, even though she had already experienced sex with a man several times.

However, even though she had already agreed to be his concubine, she hadn't been officially welcomed yet.

As for Kohari's current status, I suppose she could be classified as an unmarried woman.

So she consulted Rumon about my call and decided to ask him to accompany her to the mayor's office.

"Did Rumon say anything to you?"

In response to my question, Kohli gave a small denial.

"He told me to go to the mayor's office as soon as possible, and pushed me out of the room."

The reason I called Kohari was to return a memento to him.

I was glad that Rumon hadn't spoiled it for me.

"That's good. Kohari, come closer."

I had expected her to hesitate a little, if not reject me.

She would understand that she was going to be a concubine, but she had done it so many times before that I thought it was inevitable that she would be a little wary.

"Yes."

However, Kohari approached me with an innocent smile on her face and the relaxed gait characteristic of a young lady.

Her movements were so unguarded that I was confused.

"Mu ...... wait. After all, you should sit on that couch over there."

It's not in front of the mayor's desk, but points to a sofa set up nearby. It's a sofa big enough for about five adult males to sit on at once.

When I saw Kohli sitting on the edge of the sofa, I picked up the small box in the drawer and left the seat.

I sat down next to her.

In a snake-like motion, I wrapped my arms around her waist and pressed my entire body against hers.

"Oh."

"Kohari, thank you for coming."

I shook Kohari's hand, trying to keep my tone gentle.

She moved her eyes from side to side as if embarrassed and closed her mouth, which was about to open.

"How's work?　You seem to be working very hard. ......"

I hadn't had much time to talk to Kohli.

Since we were alone, I decided to take the opportunity to communicate with her.

Kohari was too well-behaved and smiling for me to talk to her, so I asked her what she was comfortable talking about.

"It's so much fun."

Sure enough, Kohli jumped on the bait I had spread.

She talked about her daily life as a scullery maid, like a dog wagging its tail for praise.

I praised Kohli's work with open arms and gently stroked her shoulders, arms and back each time. It's a strategy to remind her that it's natural for me to touch her.

Sometimes she would squint her eyes and accept my nudging, and I could feel the small animal-like quality of a thick-haired rabbit, which soothed my heart.

"...... So I've become good friends with Tico and her friends. I'm glad to have more friends."

After chatting for quite a while, we finally came to a recent topic.

Apparently, Kohari likes to talk, but I guess she usually only has her brother to talk to.

Rumon had told me that Kohari doesn't have many friends. Inevitably, he would have few people to talk to.

She talked on and on, leaving no room for me to interrupt her.

"I've never had so many friends my age before. ...... Every day is so much fun."

For Kohari, it was a new experience to be the guardian of the 30 protected girls, embroidering together, drinking tea, and chatting.

I could tell she was having a good time by the way she reported to me with a smile on her face what she had said or what she had done.

"The mayor came today, so everyone was happy."

"Huh?"

As the young nobleman who brought the wicked merchant to justice, I'm said to be very popular with the guardian girls.

I don't know who brings them in, but they've been building up an image of me based on the gossip they hear about me from outside the mansion, and they're cackling with excitement.

Maybe the Wilk in their brains is an idol creature that doesn't pee or piss.

The real me pisses and urinates, and even squirts semen.

"Tico was very excited to see me. I was also happy that the mayor came."

The real me is the kind of person who would rape her sister in front of her brother after a graft, but Kohari seems to have forgotten all about it in the past few days.

Perhaps her memory had been tampered with while listening to the delusional talk of the protective girls.

I was in a space where more than 30 people were praising me endlessly, so it was no wonder that the negative factors against me were mitigated.

I'd like to try an experiment to see what would happen if I threw Eve in there.

"...... Brother told me that you protected me from those scary people, didn't you?

Those scary people are probably the perverted merchants and their associates.

The perverted merchant who wanted to get hold of Kohari had hired a bunch of ruffians to harass her.

"It's only natural to protect the ones you care about, right?"

"Uh-huh."

Kohari smiled elegantly, putting his hand over his mouth. I'm sure you'll agree with me.

I decided that this was the right time to attack her, so I took out the small box I had in my pocket and exposed it in front of her.

"I'm going to give this to my precious Kohari as a token of my marriage."

"What is this?"

When she received the box, she silently played with it in her hands and looked at me as if she wanted to know if she could open it.

I hugged her shoulders, untied the box and took off the lid.

What was there was a mana crystal that Kohari had inherited from her late mother.

The crystal was transparent, similar to crystal, and shone brightly in the light of the magic lighting that illuminated the room.

"It must be important to you."

"What ......?　This is a ...... eh ......?　No ......?"

Kohari hid her mouth with her hands, but her red eyes were wide open, as if they were about to fall out.

I took the crystals in the small box, took her hand and handed it to her.

"I'm not lying. I've checked with Rumon."

"Ah ...... ah ......"

Kohari stroked the mana crystal with her slender fingertips, as if checking its shape.

After a few moments of checking, she was finally convinced, and she slowly closed her palm and pulled her clenched fist to her chest.

"...... mother....... mother ...... ah ......."

Kohari put her other hand on her fist and looked down, tears spilling down her face.

I was expecting a kiss of appreciation, but the way she cried pierced my heart.

"Kohari...?"

"Ugh. ...... mother. ...... thank god. ...... mother. ...... mother, you're back. ......"

Her shoulders were shaking, and she was crying tears.

It's not a sexual desire, but a paternal feeling that leads me to embrace her.

"Thank you, Mayor ....... ......"

I was the one who took her virginity.

It's strange that being thanked so honestly makes me feel more sorry than criticized.

I hugged her in silence and continued to stroke her supple hair until her sobs ended.

Many of the people living on the continent of Eruo have habitual hair, with curly ends and wavy hair.

Kohari's hair is straight and uncombed, which is a bit unusual.

Her crimson eyes, small shapely breasts, and tight buttocks are all eye-catching, but it is her straight silver hair that is most distinctive.

It's beautiful.

I couldn't help but let out a heartfelt sigh as I felt comfortable stroking it.

The texture of the hair is quite different, but it is similar to that of the thick-haired rabbit's body hair in that it feels good to touch.

I feel that Kohari is somewhat like a thick-haired rabbit. She seems to be a bit like a thick-haired rabbit, especially when she seems to be unable to live by herself.

Maybe owners take after their pets.

"Mmm♡"

It's also cute when you pet it and it makes a cute purr.

"Good, good girl."

As I stroked her head, I wondered if I should just push her down on the sofa.

If I'm going to play with her, I'd rather do it slowly and lovingly in the bedroom.

"That ......"

"What is it?"

Kohari, who is completely in my arms, looks up at me with her face slightly down and her eyes only looking up at me.

Even though I'm shorter than her, I can't help but get excited when she makes a small gesture and stares at me.

And it's scary because Kohari doesn't aim to do it, but does it naturally.

She is a beautiful woman who needs to be protected by someone. Isn't this the best stimulation for the male sex?

"I'm sure my brother will be happy to see this.　I'm sure my brother will be very pleased."

It's a thought process like a toddler who goes to show his parents what he has received. This is what makes me smile, and also makes me feel a little jealous.

Right now, the best person for Kohari would be her brother, Rumon. But I wanted to take his place one day.

"...... Oh, go ahead. Rumon will be relieved."

The desire for exclusivity that had been bubbling up in me gradually turned into sexual desire.

I'm sure it will take some time to dye her heart my color, but that's why I'm going to dye her body my color, or to be more specific, a cloudy white color.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 133 - Eating the daughter of a former merchant family that I've gradually grown to love(2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kohari left the mayor's office in a languid mood.

I returned to the mayor's desk, regretting the sweet lingering scent of her long hair.

I wondered if I should do the deed in my bedroom or crawl into the night like before. The brainstorming session unanimously adopted the night crawl.

Finishing the day's activities on a high note, I began the preparatory exercises for intercourse.

Bending and stretching exercises, back and forth movements of the hips, may not be necessary for a young body of 12 years old, but it somehow makes me feel elated.

I looked out the window and saw the moon floating in the clear winter sky.

My breath turned white and it soon melted into the darkness of the night.

I continued down the cold corridor, warming it with my magic, and came to the front of Kohari and Rumon's room.

As usual, there was a plaque on the door that read "Rumon & Kohari".

I opened the door without making a sound and went inside, but there was no response.

It had been about an hour since Kohari had left the mayor's office, and it seemed that both of them had already fallen asleep.

Unlike the Japanese people, the people of Luo continent go to sleep as soon as it gets dark. The only person who spends a long night using lighting magic is me, who still can't get rid of the habit from my previous life.

"Goo......"

I hear a not-so-cute sleeping sound. It's probably Rumon's, echoing low.

He seemed to be tired from all the work he had been burning up lately.

I walked through the room without making a sound and approached Kohari's bed.

The sensation of quietly sneaking up on the girl I wanted to mate with was really exciting.

I turned on the dim, low light magic and saw Kohari lying on her side, asleep.

I gently turned up the blanket and crawled in, my stomach against her back.

"Huh, huh?"

Kohari made an unintelligible sound in her sleep in response to my entrance.

"Mmm-hmm."

The feeling of being defenseless in the face of imminent danger is truly irresistible.

I hug her close and slip my hand through the gap between the top and bottom of her nightgown.

"...... Hmm?"

When I put my hand on her chest, Kohli's neatly organized tits fit perfectly in my palm.

They are small, but not flat. They are large enough to be squeezed firmly.

I moved my fingers in a circular motion, gradually working my way to the top of her breasts.

"Oh, ......."

I touched the nipple, enjoying the way Kohari's voice twitched and trembled.

Kohari's nipples are usually half full, so I wait for the real nipples to emerge by stimulating them.

I play with both breasts with my fingertips and press my crotch against her ass to enjoy the softness.

As I buried my nose in her moist hair and smelled her scent, my heartbeat quickened and my penis hardened.

I let my fingers crawl down from the circles on her nipple rings, through her soft belly to her private parts.

Reaching the humid space, my fingers braved the soggy pubic hair meadow to reach her most cherished spot.

I gently touched it with my fingertips, but there was little moisture, suggesting that she was still preparing for intercourse.

"Aaah ......!　Hmm?　What?"

Kohari's consciousness was awakened by the touch of the sensitive part.

"Kohari?"

"What?"

I put my hands on Kohari's shoulders and called out her name, breathing on both her nape and ears.

She must have guessed who I was by my voice, because she shrugged her shoulders, rolled over and turned her body towards me.

Her eyes were as red as a vampire's, illuminated by weak lighting magic and floating in the dark night, and I felt as if I were being sucked in as I stared into them.

"............ Mayor?"

"I'm here to see you.

"Uh.."

I put my hand on Kohli's chin, ignoring the snoring of the room on the bed next to me.

"Hmm. ......"

I kissed her lightly, taking advantage of her sleepy confusion.

I kissed her again and again, enjoying the softness of her lips as if she were a bird nibbling on them.

"Churu...... haha, Kohari...... chu♡"

"Chuu ............, wait ......, my brother ......."

He must have guessed what I was looking for, because he made a small, sad sound.

"No. I want Kohari now. I want Kohari right now."

Kohari likes to be held powerfully. No, it would be more accurate to say that she is sexually weak.

I hugged her body as hard as I could, tightening my grip on her words of resistance.

The feeling of the soft flesh on her slender body was comfortable, and I couldn't help but relax my arms, wanting to taste more.

"Oh, ............, ......, no, no, ............ afu......♡"

I pressed my lips against Kohli's as she let out a sweet, melting breath.

I twirled my tongue in a sticky mess, savoring the taste of her.

"Churuu...... chu............ chumu, haha, Kohari......

"Yaaaah ...... leh...... mmm...... chu...... chu......, my brother is ...... chu♡ mmm...... chu......."

I kissed her hard so that Rumon who was probably asleep in bed would hear.

As if to assert that Kohari was my woman, I sucked her lips, flicked my tongue, and swirled our saliva together.

I repeatedly loosened and tightened my arms around her, caressing her roughly all over her body.

"Chug. That's good, Kohari. ...... Chuuuuu, chup ♡ My Kohari, chup ♡"

Judging from my past experience, Kohari is basically a lonely person and tends to depend on men who are dependable.

If you show her how you feel and how much you accept her, her heart will start to roll in.

I called her name again and again, and kissed her again and again.

"I'll always protect you, my precious Kohari. Chuu. Chuuuuu ......♡"

"Mmmm ...... chu. 

When I felt Kohari's body heat up, I loosened my embrace and disturbed her nightgown.

When her breasts were open, I grabbed her breasts, and when her attention shifted to them, I reached my other hand down to her lower body.

The moment his fingertips touched her labia, which were now even wetter than before, she struggled to resist.

"No, no...No, no...My brother will wake up...-"

"It's all right if you keep quiet. I'll give you lots of love."

I kissed Kohli's lips, as if to say, "That's not what I meant.

I put my hands on her back and pushed her down so that she was on her back.

"Chup ......, be quiet. You'll wake up Rumon."

"Oh ......!"

When I let go of her lips, Kohari turned her gaze in the direction of her brother's bed, praying to see what was going on.

But it was dark in this room with only weak lighting magic, and I couldn't see Rumon, who was supposed to be in the darkness.

As Kohari tried to figure out if his brother was asleep or awake, I began my next action.

"...... you have cute breasts."

"......?

I peeled off her completely disheveled top half of her nightgown, exposing her breasts completely.

The breasts were not very voluminous, even though they had been raised on good food, but their well rounded shape was like a meat bun and looked really delicious.

Her nipples were still erect thanks to her continued arousal, and she was insisting on sucking on them.

"Hmph!"

"Heeeee!"

I suddenly attacked the main part of the body.

I licked the nipple in my mouth with my tongue in a circular motion, enjoying the nice feeling of it.

The nipple was licked in a circular motion with my tongue, enjoying its feeling.

I sucked on her breasts, making a deliberate and disgusting water sound that echoed around the room.

I sucked on her breasts, making deliberate and disgusting water sounds that echoed around the room.

"Oh, ......, ............, I'm so embarrassed. ...... Oh, stop it. ......"

After enjoying the right breast, I caressed the left breast as well. Both sides are equal.

I presses my tongue, which is generously wet with saliva, against the breast as if it were dripping.

"Oh, ......, ......, that tickles, ......."

"Chuu."

I can hear the sweet moaning that stimulates me by just listening to it.

I did not stop caressing her ass and back while enjoying her tits.

I decided to proceed slowly and insistently with my caresses on her lips.

At first, I just touched her inner thighs, and then, little by little, like a caterpillar crawling, I advanced my finger, which eventually reached her labia.

"Ohhh...♡...♡...Oh♡...No...Oh, no♡"

Kohari seems to be very receptive to my finger movements.

When I tried to kiss her, I felt her saliva become more viscous and she seemed to get hotter.

I wonder if it would be better if it were not here.

The first time she had held Kohari, her brother had been present, but now she was more embarrassed than ever.

I guess she's less anxious about being alone with me, which is a nice change.

"I'm not going to let you go, Kohari. You're mine, and no one else can have you."

A feeling of joy welled up deep in my heart, and I decided to give in to it.

I whispered my love in Kohari's ear, kissed her deeply with passion, and intensified my caresses on her private parts.

"Agh ♡ Hah ...... ♡♡"

Her palms were sopping wet and her breath was clearly tinged with lust.

I finally reached the end of my patience and pulled down my pants to show her my raging cock.

"Haha, I'm going to pour my seed into you. I want you to take it like a wife, okay?"

I pull down the slightly caught skin to expose the swollen glans, which looks like it's about to explode.

The clear juice that dripped from the tip glistened in the moonlight.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 134 - Eating the daughter of a former merchant family that I've gradually grown to love(3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kohari's vagina was wet enough, as I could tell from the sensation of my fingers touching it.

When I slipped my middle finger into her vagina, I felt a very strong tightness, but it went in without any problem.

It was nice and slippery. I was ready to fuck at any time.

"Oh, ......."

"Come on, sit up."

I couldn't take off Kohari's nightgown pants while she was lying down.

I put my hands on her thighs and she silently lifted her hips as if she had given up.

She lifted her hips to let the man take off her pants. ...... It was an erotic pose that I can't describe.

"Kohli's body seems to be telling her that it wants to connect with me as soon as possible, right?"

I whispered in her ear as I slid down her nightgown, her wet pubic area tingling with the need for a man's cock, but she seemed to be aware of this and covered her face with her hands.

I tossed her nightgown pants to the side of the bed and began my final caress before penetration.

The most erotic sound in the room echoed through the room, and Kohari's shoulders shook as she let out a mixture of a gasp and a moan.

"...... Come on, let's go."

"Oh ......."

When I was in the normal position, with my penis at her vulva, I stuck close to Kohari and covered her with the blanket.

If Rumon peeked at us, all he would see was my head and Kohari's. From the neck down, nothing can be seen because of the blanket.

The sight of us mating without exposing our bodies, hiding under the blanket, was immoral and exciting.

"Oh ......"

"Ohhhh ...... ah, so hard ...... ♡"

Despite Kohari's reluctance to have intercourse in this room, her body seemed to be waiting for the first male penis in a long time.

The hot vaginal walls wrapped gently around my penis and then began to devour it violently.

"Haa...... haa...... good...... Kohari, wow, that's hot...... ♡♡♡."

"Ugh ...... ugh ...... haha ♡ Please don't move ...... ah, ah ...... ♡"

Slowly, with a sinking motion into the bed, I brought my body closer to Kohari's.

I'm sure she's trying to keep her panting down a bit, so she's holding her mouth with both hands, but I shift them and give her a thick, saliva-filled kiss.

The stimulation from the tongue and the skin, even through the clothes, made my penis even harder, and my brain was dyed with lust.

I regretted now that I should have taken off my top half of my nightgown.

"Koharii, Koharii ......!　Chuchu, chuchu ♡"

I put my lips on hers as I put my weight on it, and thrust my cock even deeper, thinking only of reaching her most important place.

"Ugh!　Kuh-hah ......!　Koharii ......♡"

When I realized that I couldn't go any further, I relaxed my arms and legs and lay my body on top of hers.

When I checked with my fingers, I found that my cock had penetrated her to the base, and had successfully penetrated her body.

She stopped moving her hips and savored the movement of her vagina from the penis.

It was very tight, but also very comfortable, as Kohari's vagina regularly tightened in small increments.

"Do you understand, ......?　I'm deep inside of you right now. ......"

I concentrated on the feel of the glans, and it seemed to be reach as far inside as possible.

The feeling of accomplishment that I had conquered her insides made me feel like I was about to ejaculate.

I slowly pulled my hips back to make sure I didn't accidentally ejaculate, and made sure my cock was halfway out.

Then I thrust my penis all the way in.

"Aaah!"

The wooden bed shuddered as I moved.

"Kuhu......♡ Oh no......"

"Hmmm ...... do you not like it?"

When I started to pull my hips back again, Kohli put her legs around my hips and kept them close together. I guess it was a defensive measure to prevent the penis from ramming into me too vigorously.

But the way she was moving made me feel as if she was trying to keep her manhood intact, and my arousal went through the roof.

"Oh ......♡ Kohli, you want it deeper, don't you?"

If she didn't like the intense pistoning, she could try a different approach.

I groped for the deepest part of her vagina, just moving my hips forward.

At first, Kohari seemed to endure the foreign sensation of the penis pushing into her vagina, but as I continued my attack, she began to moan more and more.

"Agh ♡ ahh ♡ deep ...... ♡ ahh ♡"

The vagina wrapped around the cock also seemed to be drunk with pleasure, and the rhythm of the contractions became wild and rough.

It seems that this is the way she prefers to be attacked.

"You have a lovely voice. I want to hear more."

Kohari seemed to be feeling very aroused, her breath leaking out through the gap between the fingers on her mouth.

As my body was getting hotter, I took off my nightgown jacket and stripped completely naked.

"Kohari......!"

"Aah♡"

As our bare skin met, Kohari's voice was full of pleasure and sensuality.

She looked ecstatic, as if to say that she had been waiting for this all along.

Kohari clutched at me with her nails, as if trying to tear the flesh from my back.

It was a grip so strong that I couldn't believe it was hers. Maybe she was close to climax.

Kohari hugged me in a voice so sad that I was about to cry.

I'm not a man if I don't respond to this.

I hugged her body as hard as I could and leaned over her as if to crush her.

At the same time, I thrust my penis deep into her vagina and tried with all my might to perform her favorite attack.

"Ohhhh ♡"

Her vagina twitched and tightened, and her fingers, which had been wrapped around my back, scratched my back with all their might.

I tightened my hold on her and stirred her vagina with my penis as hard as I could.

Kohari was panting heavily, almost hyperventilating, and was drunk from my aggression.

She was drooling and tears were welling up around her eyes, but from the look on her face, it looked like she was begging for more.

She was like animal in heat, which is unimaginable from her normal demeanor.

I, of all people, am the one who sees it closest to me. I'm the only one who knows the face of her beast.

My cock swells up and begins to prepare itself for ejaculation.

The desire to dominate, to possess, to conquer... I felt an intense feeling well up in my chest, and my whole body began to tremble as I tried to shoot from the tip of my penis.

I must stain her vagina with my semen and make her mine.

I had to make her mine.

"Kohari ......!　I'm going to let you out. Take my baby. ......!　Aah!"

I hugged her as hard as I could, thrust my penis in to reach her womb, and I ejaculated.

"Ggh!

"Aaaaahhhh ......♡"

With a pleasant sensation that seemed to melt my brain, semen flew out with great force.

I wondered how much of it was coming out, and it seemed like there was no end to the amount of seed that was being shot out in small increments.

Saliva dripped from her unconsciously open mouth, and my squirming rod continued to quiver like a different creature.

Her vagina must have remembered its original role after receiving the semen, because it began to contract in a rhythm that encouraged her to ejaculate in order to squeeze out the long awaited seed.

I let the gentle movements of her vagina caress and compliment my penis, and I continued to squirt my semen.

"Goo...... haha♡ U......!"

Kohari's hands moved from my back to my waist as she hugged me.

It was as if she was silently insisting that I give her more semen. I put my lips on hers.

"Chuu♡"

"Chuu♡"

Kohari was eager to kiss me, but I couldn't get my movements right, so I gave her a rudimentary kiss where our teeth clashed and made a sound.

Their tongues clashed fiercely in each other's mouths, entwining powerfully as they sought each other out.

She occasionally stiffened, as if numbed by electricity, as if she was repeatedly climaxing.

"...... chu♡"

I stroked her hair, catching my breath as I sensed my seed was gone.

"I'm not going to give my Kohari ...... to anyone. ...... to anyone."

"......ok ♡"

I whispered as I dipped my penis into her sperm-filled vagina.

With our joined genitals intact, I continued to mumble their thoughts about Kohari to no one in particular.

As I regained my breath, which had become ragged with intercourse, Kohari whispered to me.

"I want you to squeeze me."

"Yes?"

Her voice was so faint that I momentarily lost track of it.

I could sense that it was not a request for sexual arousal, but a request for tenderness.

I could feel the love for her slowly spreading in my heart.

"Good, good, good girl."

I wrapped her gently in my arms. I didn't hold her, I wrapped her.

I touched her hair, stroking her head, and rested my chin on her shoulder, cheek to cheek.

"You did a good job, you were so cute. I'm going to protect you ...... all the time, Kohari. Always."

"Mmm, ......♡"

When Kohari heard my words, she replied with satisfaction, closed her eyes, and began to sleep peacefully.

There was no time to enjoy the pillow talk after the act. However, I felt a sense of satisfaction that I couldn't put into words when I saw her peaceful sleeping face.

By the way, the snoring from the bed next to me had disappeared before I knew it.

I'll give him some more money for a brothel tomorrow.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 135 - Poor brother
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After twelve years of living without an alarm clock, just the arrival of the morning is enough to wake me up.

The windows were covered with wooden boards to prevent the morning sun from reaching them, but my senses told me it was time to get up.

For a few moments, I couldn't think of where I was, but when my hand touched the warm presence lying next to me, I remembered what I had done last night.

I used my magic to illuminate my hand, and there was Kohari, sleeping, breathing softly.

Her expression was reassuring, and her mouth was occasionally moving in a squirming motion. If I offered her my penis, she might suck on it.

I thought I'd give it a try, so I looked at my dick and saw that it was still intact from last night's activity. I didn't feel comfortable letting her suck my cock in this state.

In addition to that, the dry winter air was making my whole body scalding.

Last night, I had lost myself in a fit of sleep as Kohari slept, so I had only half finished processing her bodily fluids.

When I turned the blanket over, the smell of sex that comes from the mixing of a man and a woman filled the air.

"Muah!"

I pecked her on the cheek, but she showed no sign of waking up.

I turned around and looked at Rumon's bed, but it was already empty.

It would have been awkward if he woke up at the same time as me and Kohari, so he must have left the room quickly. He is a very thoughtful brother.

"Kohari, look.

As I played with Kohari's cheek, making an octopus mouth between my fingers, she finally woke up.

For a moment, she was surprised to see me in bed, but she soon let her guard down.

"...... Good morning."

"Oh."

The way she greeted me in the morning was that of a young lady, but she was completely naked, which made her very sexy.

I had slept on only one ejaculation last night, and my body was begging for more.

I smiled at Kohari as I held my penis, which had gone from a morning erection to a serious erection.

"Let's take a bath together and wash away the sweat of last night."

Of course, Tesh and the others knew that I had taken Kohari into my arms.

Since I didn't take a bath after sex, they must have anticipated that I would take a bath in the morning. They must be boiling the bath just in time for me to wake up from sleep.

I got out of bed and took Kohari's hand, who was relieved to see that her brother was not in the bed next to him.

I was finally satisfied when I gave Kohari the first, second, and third pumps of my semen in the morning in the bath, leaving her exhausted and Odie to help her.

The three rounds of cum seemed to be enough to wake Kohari's consciousness.

After I finished changing, I came to the room where the civil servants and city employees were working.

The staff had already started working, and the air was lively.

"Hey, where's Rumon?"

I grabbed a staff member who was walking nearby and asked him where Rumon was.

I'm sure he agonized over his sister's moans last night, so I thought I'd give him some brothel money before he forgot.

"Rumon is teaching the new scullery maid her trade. Would you like me to go get him?"

"You hired a scullery maid?"

There were several scullery maids in the mayor's mansion, and one of them was Kohari.

I'm not sure if Rumon, who witnessed last night's violent sexual intercourse, knew it was only a matter of time before his sister became pregnant and immediately hired a new scullery maid. He is a very quick-witted man.

"I'm not saying he hired her, but ......, you know, there was a boy among the girls we protected the other day ......."

Oh, I remember one of them.

I think he is referring to Tico's younger brother, who was captured as part of a sister brother sex show. I think his name was Kianes.

He was the poor little brother who got an erection from licking Tico's cunt and then got kicked out of the show.

"Yes. I've invited the boy here from time to time as a scullery maid. He seems to have some thoughts about ......."

"Something on your mind?"

"What does the erection brother think about the erection brother?"

"I don't know what to say. ......"

In response to my question, the official seemed to have a very difficult time answering.

Then a civil official who had been watching us nearby walked up to us.

"The boy's father and brother were mercenaries in the Battle of Nambonan City, and he says that Nambonan City killed his father and brother, and that Rumon is bitter about it."

It's his father and brother who are to blame, since they were lured by money and defied their lord.

The people who were protected in the perverted house were interviewed about their place of origin, and the village where Tico and Kianes were from belonged to the Quardenze territory. It was a new territory taken from the Imperial nobility.

Although there was a change in the territory's affiliation due to the war, the lord of the territory was still the Quardenze family.

Becoming a mercenary for the city of Nambonan in defiance of the Quardenze family was not the right thing to do as a citizen of the territory.

It is as you say, Young Master. You are right, young master. There is no room for sympathy for a fool who is a citizen of Quardenze and yet is willing to join the Nambonan City of that time.

I could see why the staffer was stunned. I guess he didn't want to talk about Nambonan when it was a hostile city.

Unlike the civilian officers of the military in Quardenze, the city officials were citizens of Nambonan. They wouldn't want to talk about it too much.

"The boy said that Nambonan City was recruiting mercenaries without telling them who they were fighting. The boy's sister also said that no one expected ...... to fight against the lord."

Isn't this a scam?

It seems that it was left to the discretion of the person in charge to decide how much information to pass on. Many of the mercenaries knew that they were going to fight the Quardenze family, so the person in charge who visited the boy's village must have been deceiving them.

I would have thought that they should have at least confirmed who they were going to fight before entering the war, but they must have taken advantage of the sweet offer from the well-paying Nambonan City.

But to Kianes, this is just an act of fraud by the city of Nambonan.

Perhaps it's inevitable that Rumon, who loved Nambonan, would be concerned.

"I see, so you are being accommodating."

Yes. It's a great way to get a little bit of extra cash when you return to the village. The boy seemed to be wary at first, but he soon seemed to take to Rumon. The number of visits here has increased recently.

Yesterday, he was working as a fireplace guard at the pervert's house, but when he's free, he comes to the mayor's mansion to do chores.

It's a good thing that he has the guts to work ahead of time instead of rebelling or sulking.

Besides, it's not a good situation for a 12-year-old boy to be surrounded by 30 beautiful women. He must be jerking off every night. Kianes' cock is getting worn out from the friction.

If he misses Rumon, he might as well make a temporary Kianes room in the warehouse of the mayor's mansion.

If Kianes is in the perverted mansion, which is a rear court position, people might think he's a philanderer.

When I was thinking about it, the civil servant added in an uncomfortable tone.

"Besides, I had a miserable time at the mansion. ......"

"Disastrous?"

The only kinky show I remember seeing was Kianes licking his sister's cunt after she peed her pants.

I don't think it's so tragic if it's like that. For me, it's more of a reward.

"...... Oh, by the way, young master was protecting the boy's sister, wasn't he? Don't you know what happened to the boy when he was taken into custody?"

In the middle of the perverted show, my crotch gave out, and Kianes was taken out of the room, followed by the guests and the civil servants who had followed along with him.

So I didn't know what happened to Kianes after that, and I wasn't interested. I just assumed that he had been protected for some reason.

I was busy torturing Tico.

"What's going on?"

One of the guests was a man with a quality of being excited by boys. ......

Apparently, one of the guests at the pervert house was the type of pervert who was excited by young boys.

If you ask me, I think there was one fat middle-aged man who was excited to see Kianes' erect dick.

Kianes was taken out of the room blindfolded and moved to another room.

He said that he had become the erect little brother and that the perverted customer had sucked him off.

"Ugh. ......"

He was blindfolded, so he thought he was being sucked off by his sister and was intoxicated by her exquisite tongue.

When the military came to the room to give evidence of tax evasion, Kianes fainted from the sheer pleasure, and the perverted customer was in ecstasy with semen all over his face.

According to the pervert, he ejaculated three times.

"Yeah, that's ...... miserable."

"Yeah. ...... As you can imagine, it's a terrible thing to tell a boy that he's been sucked off by that man, so we're keeping it a secret from him."

The civil servants decided that if it was sucked by an ugly middle-aged fat man and sucked by a beautiful sister, the latter would be a better memory.

I didn't expect to hear from Kianes, "Your blowjob felt good, sister. Please do it again!"

Tico wouldn't even bother to bring up the subject.

Thus, the secret would be kept forever.

I left the room, praying for Kianes' peace of mind.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 136 - Commoner literacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I returned to the mayor's office, I decided to clean up the materials spread out on my desk.

As is the case at New Nellie Castle, the servants don't clear my desk unless I tell them to do so.

Although it was a hassle to clean up the desk, it was more troublesome to change the arrangement of the materials to suit my needs without my permission.

As I was sorting through the materials I needed and didn't need on my desk, I came across a super-secret document submitted by Odie just the other day.

This is something that cannot be shown to anyone else.

"Hmmm... ......"

The true nature of the document was a menstrual chart that listed the menstrual cycles of all the protected girls.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a thing.

If I were to compare them to Japan in a previous life, they might be close to the level of the prettiest girls in their junior high or high school grades.

It's not so much that they are stunningly beautiful girls, but it's nice to feel their simple loveliness.

Odie may have sensed something when she saw me deciding to protect them. A hearing was held later that day, and the menstruation chart was completed.

I did not give any instructions.

I opened the document and checked the contents.

Since I went to visit the pervert's house yesterday, the names and faces on the list match a little. I'm in an erotic mood.

"...... Mm."

I didn't have a girlfriend in my previous life, so I didn't know how to calculate safe and dangerous days.

Even if I remembered, I wouldn't care. Rather, having sex on dangerous days is more exciting.

Incidentally, Odie didn't make this chart with that much thought in mind. She prepared it so that my desire to fuck would not coincide with the target's menstruation.

I don't have any plans to hold the protected girls at the moment, but with young men and women, you never know what will happen when things get exciting.

I'm sure I'll be visiting the pervert house more often from now on, and if I get the chance, I'll be willing to fuck them.

I run my fingers over the names on the menstrual chart, remembering the faces and bodies I saw yesterday and imagining how it would feel to hold them.

They would never dream that I, their hero and idol, would be having such a vulgar fantasy.

"Hmm..."

The names on the menstrual chart are sorted by age, so Tico's name is the one written at the bottom.

Next to Tico's name, there is no information written. This is because you can't write something that isn't there.

The other day, Tico had a lot of semen in her, but she hadn't had her first menstruation yet.

The day after I took them into custody, I was planning to call her up and have some sweet sex with her to ease her mind.

However, Odie had provided me with this chart that showed me that she was not yet ready to be a woman.

Even if I poured my semen into her, she would not get pregnant. The mere thought of this caused my burning cock to rapidly deflate and I stood there.

I loved the look on a woman's face when she became aware that she was going to have a baby.

Whether they are uncomfortable or happy, that is what raises my erection the most.

If it was a woman who was struggling with infertility, I would have another energy to say, "Then I'll impregnate her."

But unfortunately, this didn't apply to Tico. Perhaps rural girls don't develop well. Her breasts were small, too.

Thus, I decided to stop holding Tico and watch her grow up with my lewd eyes.

I told the civil servants to feed her well, hoping that she would mature during the protection period. I want to fatten her up and make sure she tastes good.

I was shocked when I saw the menstrual chart and spent the next few days having sex with Anna in mourning for the sperm that had been wasted in Tico's vagina.

It was a win-win situation for Anna, but she was also happy.

I had just put my menstrual chart in my desk drawer when there was a knock at the door. Judging from the knocking, it must be Rumon.

I gave my permission to enter, and the door opened quietly.

"Excuse me."

The two who entered were Rumon and Kianes. I had asked the staff to tell them to come to the mayor's office when they returned.

Kianes, who seemed to have been trained in some manners, imitated Rumon's movements and quietly entered the room.

"Here, Kianes."

Kianes, who was patted on the back by Rumon, got down on his knees on the spot, put his fingers on the floor, and thanked him for rescuing him from the perverted house.

He must have practiced this beforehand, because his body movements and speech were smooth and different from when he entered the room.

I allowed myself to stand up on the spot in response to Kianes' words.

"I'm glad to see that you have a good understanding of the situation. You don't seem to have a bad head on your shoulders."

Kianes and I are the same age. I'm taller than you, but if we stood side by side, we'd look like two boys.

In response to my arrogant attitude, Kianes seemed to be in awe and took a half step back.

"Thanks for the ......!"

"He can work fine. He can read and write, so he's not too bad to use."

Rumon explains the reason why he brought Kianes from the perverted house.

As the staff and civil servants had said, they had prepared the job so that Tico and Kianes would not have to return to their home village penniless.

But I was more concerned about something else.

"You can read and write?　You're a child of the countryside, aren't you?　How well can you do that?"

The first thing that troubled me when I was reincarnated was learning Luo.

In my previous life, I couldn't even speak English, so I was filled with a sense of despair.

However, due to being thrown into an environment where there were no one else who could speak Luo at all times, my linguistic skills rapidly developed over the years, and now I have a Luo brain, not an English brain.

Nowadays, when I think about things, I have a strange environment in my brain where Japanese and Luo are mixed together.

I have a feeling that I will forget all about Japanese in a few decades, so I keep my diary in Japanese.

It took me a great deal of effort to acquire this language, but the literacy rate among the commoners is naturally low.

I've been exploring New Nelly City on the sly, and my feeling is that only about 30% of the citizens can read and write.

That 30% includes those who can only understand their own names and the names of commonly used items. The number of people who can write proper sentences may be less than 10 percent.

It's a good thing that I can read and write Eruo even though I'm from the northern part of the continent, the land of mist. ...... Even if you become educated in this way, you will still end up a sex slave, so life is heartless.

The literacy rate is low even in places like New Nellie, where the level of citizens seems to be high.

"It's hard to say to what degree, but ....... I can write to the extent that I can summarize the events of the day and communicate them to others. My writing is poor, though."

"You're a good writer."

What did you do when you woke up in the morning? What did you do after that? I did this and did that. It was lunchtime. I did my work. Work is the work of doing this and that. After work, I had dinner. I ate dinner and went to bed.

If you can write a crappy diary like this, it's safe to say that you can read and write by commoner standards. In fact, I would even boast that I am good at it.

"How do commoners learn to read?"

As far as I know, there is no such thing as a municipal elementary school for commoners in the continent of Eruo.

In the first place, there is no such thing as a school for nobles to study, so there can be no such thing as an educational institution for commoners.

In the royal capital of the Levios Kingdom, there is a kind of academy where young nobles gather, but this is not for the purpose of study.

The study of noble children is basically a private tutoring system.

In the case of the Quardenze family, they gather their relatives and educated retired knights from subordinate knight families to tutor them.

In this way, the children learn Eruo language, arithmetic, history, how to be a nobleman, and so on, so they can learn without any problems even if they remain confined in the territory.

"Not all commoners study letters. There are a few who do."

"I suppose that's true."

Even if you can't read or write, you won't have much trouble living on the continent of Eruo. There are plenty of jobs that require physical capital.

In fact, you can make a much better living if you have a job in your hands than if you are halfway literate.

As for learning, if a family can afford it, they hire a teacher.

Rumon, the heir to a merchant family, said that the teachers his father hired taught him letters and math.

As the son of a merchant family, Rumon was taught to read, write, and calculate by a teacher his father had hired, who also taught Kohari, who was attached to his brother.

If you can't hire a teacher, there are people in Nambonan who make a living by gathering children and teaching them letters and math. Children from families with some money to spare often go here because they can learn for a low monthly fee.

Apparently, there is a kind of private educational system in Nambonan City. Maybe I just don't know, but New Nellie City has a similar system.

The idea of a lord providing education to his people is nowhere to be found, so a private education system must have arisen spontaneously.

"What about the rural areas?"

"It depends on the village, that's all. In some villages, all the children in the village are taught to read, while in other villages, no one, including adults, can read because they don't understand it."

In the case of villages where no one can understand the script, it seems that the lords are in trouble.

I don't know much about rural governance, but I heard that sometimes they make the village keep some kind of record or report in writing.

For this reason, the lords would force the village to hire a scribe, someone who could read and write.

The village would then have to pay for the scribe's labor in addition to taxes.

Even though it was only one person, the salary of the scribe introduced by the lord was quite high for a poor village. Their finances were on fire.

So why don't the villagers ask the scribe to teach them how to write? However, if we did that, the scribes would eventually lose their jobs.

This is how the illiterate village has remained poor for so long. It's a sad gap in education.

"In this way, illiterate villages remain poor for a long time," he said. ...... So, in rural villages, knowledge of writing is often protected as a common property of the village. I heard that even in the village of Kianes, they gathered the children and taught them letters and calculations.

"Yes!　I learned it from my grandpa, who was a board cutter. ...... I learned it from him!"

It is said that in the village of Kianes, an old man with a weakened body taught the children to write.

However, it was impossible to exchange documents with the lord's civil servants with a writing ability at the level of a crappy diary.

In the village of Kianes, they educate all the children and pick up a few promising ones and train them to become scribes.

"I was told I didn't have much of a chance, so I was dropped from the study. ......"

"It was really frustrating," Kianes said, his face falling.

The village of Kianes must be blessed, because even those who dropped out could write to a certain extent.

It's hard to believe that this is the village of an idiot who was lured by money and challenged the lord to a fight.

"I see."

In a small village, children are valuable labor, so ...... they can't be helped.

Looking at the frustrated expression on Kianes' face, I could feel that he wanted to learn more.

He looked like nothing more than a squealing little monkey in a perverted show, but surprisingly, he seemed to be a child with a plan.

"Mr. Mayor. May I ask you something?"

"What?"

"Kohari is leaving the room today. ......"

A room has already been set up for her in the pervert house.

Today, Kohari will be welcomed into the house, and Rumon will be sent a gift for the occasion.

I don't have to do anything since Odie has already arranged everything.

So the only person left in the live-in room at the mayor's mansion will be Rumon. It's going to be a lonely night.

"May I ask Kianes to join me in the spare room?"

"What?"

Rumon said that he would like to be Kianes teacher and teach him his studies after work.

He also said that it would not be a good idea for Kianes to come and go in the perverted house where Kohari, who had become my concubine, lived.

It seems that he didn't become a shota because he was lonely without his sister. That's good.

"Well, that's fine, but ...... Kianes, are you sure?　Even though you can go see her soon, you'll be living away from your sister. ......"

"I'm fine!　I want to live here if Rumon can teach me how to study!　Yes!"

It seemed that they had discussed this beforehand, and Kianes was willing to go along without any worry.

Tico and Kianes were from a village in the Quardenze, and would be sent back to their village after the winter.

The village of Kianes is in great need due to the plundering by the fugitive mercenaries, and they do not have the reserves to survive the winter if they are sent back now.

Tico and Kianes' mother was very happy to hear that they were still alive and protected, but that was about it. The three of them would have frozen to death or starved to death if they hadn't.

As for Tico and Kianes, they will be living in Nambonan City until spring.

The parents of the other guardian daughters will probably send the same message back to us.

The commoners on the continent of Eruo are well prepared for the winter, so if the number of people suddenly increases, they will be in trouble.

"Only if you really want to. I'll allow you to live with Rumon."

"Thank you very much."

"Thank you very much."

"It's good to be motivated."

If Kianes is willing to work hard and study hard, I might be able to hire him as a scullery servant at Nambonan City Hall.

That way, Tico might want to stay in Nambonan, and it would also give him a chance to call his mother.

After all, she's Tico's mother, and she's likely to be beautiful and in her thirties, possibly even in her late twenties.

If that was the case, it wouldn't be a bad idea for me to take her as a gift.

A mother and sister will give birth to my child, and their brother will work hard for me. Isn't that a wonderful future?

"I'll go back to work then."

"I'm going back!"

Seeing the two of them contentedly going back to work, I remembered the real purpose of calling them.

The status check is just an added bonus.

"Wait a minute, let's do this one last thing."

I took the silver coins out of the bag, laid them out on the desk and showed them to them.

Rumon, who was used to seeing them, was unfazed, but Kianes was amused by the excited look on his face.

Rural children don't often have silver coins in their hands.

"Take Kianes along with you."

He didn't need to say "to the brothel" to get the message to Rumon.

"I'm sure the Leahlight will know a good place. This is for the three of you. Enjoy yourselves."

I felt deep sympathy for Kianes, who had ejaculated after being sucked off by a middle-aged fat man.

Even though he wasn't aware of it, it would be a pity to let him pass the year like this.

That's why I decided to make him understand the benefits of sex.

"Thank you."

Leahlight told me that him and Rumon have been visiting brothels lately.

I've often heard that virgins get into trouble when they get into the sex industry.

I hope he will be careful not to lose himself and become disillusioned with Kohari.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 137 - Slave Trade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Rumon and Kianes left the mayor's office, I called Tesh to clean myself up.

I have plans to go out later today.

"Young master, I got a call from Doran, the slaver. He says everything is ready."

"Good. Good, then we will leave now.

We are going to buy Eve's mother, Rave. No, we've already paid for it, so if I'm saying it correctly, we're picking her up.

Originally, we were not going to pick up Rave until the renovation of the mayor's mansion was finished, but now that we have the perverted house, we were able to move it up a bit. Thanks to the pervert merchant.

At the moment, there are three rooms in the house: Anna's, Kohari's, and Rave's.

Since Anna's arrival is still planned for the future, two of the three rooms will be filled today.

The thought of having two beautiful women in my nest makes my cock harden.

I left the mayor's mansion with Tesh leading the way, and got into the carriage that had been prepared for me.

This carriage was not the gorgeous one that I usually ride in, but a normal one with less decoration.

I personally felt that the sight of the mayor proudly visiting the slavers' club was not a good look.

"I've told him to clean the building thoroughly."

"Hmm?　Oh, okay."

As the carriage began to move, Tesh, who was sitting diagonally in front of me, said.

The basic rule is that slavers are called upon when necessary. I'm sure Tesh doesn't want to take me, a noble son of the Quardenze family, to some dirty slave shop in the city.

There are several slave trading companies in New Nelly City.

Thanks to my grandfather's war, there is plenty of supply, so the slave market is much more booming in New Nelly City than in Nambonan City, but I've never been in one.

When I go around the city in secret, my status is that of a 12-year-old commoner boy, so I stand out very much when I go to the slave trade. There are not many reasons for a young boy to visit a slaver's market.

That said, visiting as a nobleman would be more troublesome.

If you go as the legitimate son of the Quardenze family, you will be welcomed as the grandson of General Galfis, who brought about a bubble in the slave market of New Nelly City.

I've always wanted to see the current state of slavery and the existence of slave traders as close to the real thing as possible, something that didn't exist in Japan in the past.

The carriage moved leisurely through the city, approaching the commercial district.

It was hard to believe that the city had been at war only a few months ago, but there was a lively scene outside the window, with many people coming and going.

The Nambonan City Council was already up and running, the merchants were quickly discussing post-war measures, and a number of new measures were being passed.

The city hall, which I conveniently use under the mayor's authority, seemed to be desperately trying to catch up with the dynamic and speedy movements of the council.

Anna had told me the other day in my arms that there was a proposal to increase the number of city employees, so I was sure that the number of employees would eventually increase.

After a while, we seemed to have arrived at our destination, and the carriage came to a stop.

Doran is a slave trader specializing in sex slaves, based in the east of the Quardenze territory, the Galiana territory ruled by Viscount Galiana.

It is said that this slave trading company in Nambonan City is run by Dolan's relatives, and they are temporarily renting it as a place to house Rave. The whole family is a slave trader, what a deeply sinister family.

I looked at the sign on the building of the merchant's association, and saw that it was called Gan-Oras Merchant Association.

Since the owner of the Gundoran Chamber of Commerce was a Doran, the owner of the Gan-Oras Chamber of Commerce might be named Oras.

Perhaps the letter Gan, common to both, is a play on an ancient word meaning "faithfulness" or "sincerity".

I wonder which of the two meanings he really gave to the name: "I sell loyal slaves" or "I am an honest merchant.

At least we know that Doran is an honest slave trader from the way he has been treating us so far.

"Ah!

I've already told Dolan that I'll be visiting today.

In the case of the Eruo continent, where you can't specify a specific time, you can only roughly specify morning, noon, and evening.

I only told him that I would be there between noon and evening, but it seems that he had his employees waiting at the back entrance of the mansion all along so that they could respond immediately when I arrived.

I'm a nobleman, so if I can't show that level of concern, I'm not a good merchant.

Because of the normal armored carriage, the employee was a moment too late to notice us and raised his voice, but as soon as he noticed us, he walked into the mansion.

It seems that the two buildings are connected, with the stores on the front street and the building on the back street.

The rectangular building was probably left as it was from the days when Nambonan City was under the rule of the Imperial nobility, and the stone was faded to a good degree, creating a heavy atmosphere.

The stone was faded to create a heavy atmosphere. I can feel the aura that says, "We will not let you escape.

As I was thinking about this, Doran and two good-looking men came to the front of the carriage.

Doran greeted them first, and then the man standing next to him began to introduce himself.

"I've been waiting for you. My name is Oras, and I'm the representative of the Gun Oras Trading Company.

It seems that my prediction was correct.

Oras led me into the building, and we walked through the inside to see the store side and the cages where the slaves were locked up.

Looking around while listening to a professional's commentary was interesting, somewhat like a factory tour. Although the slaves who are being watched probably don't find any of it interesting.

The commentary by Oras was good and easy to understand, but I was bothered by the fact that he strangely emphasized the fact that he was running a legitimate business.

"...... So, all of our slaves are sourced from the disputed areas of the Free Cities or the Misty Lands, and we never do anything unlawful like kidnapping the people of the Quadrant."

I guess that's what he wanted to say.

Just a few days ago, a perverted merchant was executed for enslaving the people of Quardenze. From the point of view of the slavers, it was not surprising that they were nervous.

What the merchants feared more than anything else was the nobility.

Some merchant can move from place to place like a peddler and get away with it, but most merchants are rooted in the land.

For such localized merchants, the nobility is an absolute presence. Their authority, based on the fact that they are protecting the land where their people live, is frighteningly strong.

Viscount Galiana once told me that the borderline between a merchant and a big merchant is when the main people to watch out for change from other companies in the same industry to the lords and nobles.

Large merchants are always thinking about how to protect their assets from the power of the nobility.

They protect their remaining assets by paying large sums of money to the nobility, they monopolize important trade to become irreplaceable for their territories, they exchange goods that are difficult to exchange for cash to make it harder for them to be robbed, or they invest large sums of money in border cities where the nobility has abandoned them and the commoners have become independent.

Nambonan City has become one of the most developed commercial cities in the continent thanks to the efforts of each and every citizen, but that is not all. The city's development as one of the leading commercial cities in the continent is due to the efforts of each individual citizen, but that is not all.

For the great merchants, Nambonan City was like a boy's dream, chasing the possibilities of a new era of property rights.

"I'm glad to see that you understand the mindset of a slave trader so well. Keep up the good work."

"Yes, of course, sir."

Oras breathed a sigh of relief when I showed him that I knew he was not doing anything illegal, so that was enough.

The rest of the explanation was easy to understand, without any strange appeals.

By the way, the merchant's dream of Nambonan City is still going on.

I don't know what kind of future he's envisioning, but it's a good thing, because it will help Nambonan develop and increase the tax revenue for the Quardenze family.

"The Free Cities, I hear there's a lot of war in that area."

"In the past few years, the supply of slaves has dwindled considerably due to St. Navenpos' efforts to broker a truce. I almost envy the merchants in New Nelly City."

The other day, Dolan and I signed a contract to sell Rave.

This fact was not told to Rave, and she was given false information that she was to be sold as a sex worker for the army.

Doran and Oras have been pressuring her every day, telling her to eat a lot of food, put on some meat, and have a lot of fun shaking her hips at the soldiers.

They are also subjected to a miserable environment where they are treated with high-handedness and disdain, with no mercy whatsoever.

Sexual harassment and excessive violence are forbidden by me. Why should I give Dolan and his friends the benefit of the doubt?

Rave is so despairing about her dark future that she's been laying low all day.

And when she sees a private customer coming to the Gan-Oras Trading Company, she stares at them with indescribable eyes.

Doran, who was a professional slave, could see that Rave was thinking of such a convenient thing.

Rave must have realized that it would be happier to be a private sex slave than to be a military cum dumpster.

"I see. ......"

"The finishing touches are sufficient. I think we can proceed as planned."

In contrast to Rave's broken heart, Dolan was proud of his craftsmanship.

This time, I might have been extra enthusiastic because I had delivered the product without any discipline at the time of Eve.

I felt a little guilty that I had dented her so badly, even though I had ordered it, but I would make her happy from now on, so it was okay.

All's well that ends well, as the saying goes.

"Rave is over there now, at a distance."

"Oh."

Doran said, pointing to a barn-like structure in the yard.

He kneeled down in front of me, put his fingers on the floor and continued in a low voice.

"...... First, an apology. Even though I was acting, I may have been rude to the legitimate son of the Quardenze family."

Since I had made all the preparations for Rave, it would not be fun to just take him in as usual.

This is why I have been thinking of various scenarios and settings to give to Dolan. When I took him in, I made sure to act the part.

In the setting, I'm a nice boy with a sense of justice, while Doran and Oras are evil slavers who look like con artists.

I've instructed them to act like thugs, so some of the things they say and do to me will be vulgar and inappropriate.

"That's fine. Any disrespect in this matter will be tolerated."

I decided to be cool and scoop up Rave's heart from the depths of hell.

The bigger the negative, the stronger the momentum will be when it turns positive.

The thought of having that beautiful woman in his life made his cock stiffen, even though it had been emptied after three rounds of Kohari in the morning.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 138 - Three actors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"You can see what's going on here."

"Oh, you can see very well."

Oras led me to the second floor of the building.

This room seemed to have a stairwell, and if I looked down, I could see the entire first floor.

The windows on the first floor were open and the sun was shining, but the second floor where I was was dark because the windows were closed.

Even if someone downstairs were to look up, it would be difficult for them to notice me.

The first floor, which was reasonably spacious, was equipped with a small sofa and a desk. It might be a room normally used for business meetings.

"Doran will now bring Rave to you, so please be quiet."

"Mm."

I was going to make a play, but I wanted to see how Rave was doing before I did.

I told him what I wanted, and he agreed to bring Rave to the first floor of this room.

This way, I could watch the current situation of Rave from the second floor.

I waited there for a while, and then the door opened with a small sound.

First Dolan, then a man who looked like an employee entered the room, followed by Rave.

I watched the proceedings, careful not to lean forward.

"Stand there."

"...... Yes."

Doran sat down on the couch and the employee stood beside him.

Rave, who was in an upright position in front of the couch, was looking at Dolan with a warlike expression.

Earlier, she had wondered what she would do if he looked up and their eyes met, but she didn't need to worry about that.

She was so frightened and alarmed by Doran's every move that she didn't seem to have time to look around.

"Too late!　Move as soon as you're told!　You're a sellout!"

"I'm sorry, sir."

The strong, angry voice that sounded as if it was hitting me echoed well in the high-ceilinged room, making me feel as if I was being scolded.

I beckoned to Oras, who was crouched down beside me, and asked him in a low voice.

"Are you really acting?"

"I'm used to it."

Doran is a slave trader who specializes in sex slaves, and naturally, many of the slaves he deals with are women.

According to Oras, women are basically very vulnerable to male abuse.

That's why the training of slaves begins with shouting at the slaves they buy.

Oh, so that's how they train their slaves.

Oras must have sensed my interest, because he opened his mouth in a reserved manner.

"Yes. May I tell you a ...... story?　We're talking about when you train a normal slave. ......"

While concerned about the state of Rave and the others downstairs, he turned to Oras to indicate his affirmation.

Then, in a small voice, Oras resumed his talk about slave training.

It seems that all the girls who have been bought as slaves are more or less rebellious at first.

Some of them are actively rebellious, complaining to their faces, while others are passively rebellious, crying and refusing to follow instructions.

Even though she was a slave, she was a girl who had lived a peaceful life until a while ago. There was no way that she would want to be a sex slave, of course.

So Dolan continued to yell at them.

He would line up his slave girls and bang them against the walls and floor with a stick that made a nice sound when struck, shouting abuse at them until their voices died.

If any of the slave girls were frightened and fell on their faces, he would grab them by their hair and raise them up and shout in their ears.

Slave girls who don't give in at this point will be sent to the corporal punishment course, so the sooner you give in, the better off you'll be. The future of being a slave will not change anyway.

In this way, the slave girls who succumbed to the abusive training, the next thing that awaited them was the blatant discrimination training.

During the training, Dolan would find one slave girl who was weak-minded and obedient, and he would blatantly favor that girl.

He would give her different meals, no physical punishment, warm blankets, and kind words in front of the other slave girls.

Because they have endured abuse together, the slave girls have a kind of camaraderie, but it all falls apart in front of this discriminatory training.

The first slave girl who is given preferential treatment feels superior to the other slave girls.

She is given special treatment by Dolan, the overwhelming ruler. The other slave girls were being treated so badly.

It was the sweetest thing that could ever happen to a weakened slave girl. The euphoria is irresistible.

The other slave girls who saw the slave girls being treated well would want to be in that position too, and would obey.

Then Doran scoops them up and favors the other girl. He acted as if he had forgotten about the slave girl he had favored until then.

A slave girl who is thrown out of the protection of the ruler is miserable. They become more and more submissive because they don't want to lose that feeling they once had.

They want to be praised as much as possible, they want to be treated well, they want to be favored more than that woman.

The trick is to use a woman's instinct to monopolize the kindness of the strong, Oras said smugly.

Thus, the enclosed space will soon be filled with women who want to be slaves.

"I educate her about the attitude of a slave, imprint on her that there is no other way but to live as a slave, and brainwash her that serving her master is the supreme pleasure."

After six months or even a year of maturing, a top-quality slave girl will be completed.

"Oh ......, that makes me curious about the other girls."

"We also have a girl who sells sex technology, so if you're interested, please contact Doran."

It seems that virgin and obedient sex slaves are the best-selling product of the Gandolan Trading Company, but they also deal in slave girls that specialize in erotic techniques.

I'm not sure if it's because of Oras's good sales talk, but I'm feeling the urge to buy.

"Do you know why I brought you here, unsold?"

The story seemed to be going on on the first floor, and Doran was echoing a low voice to Rave.

For now I'll only buy Rave. As for the other slave girls, I'll discuss it with my crotch later.

"Ah ...... ah ......!"

Doran's line was not particularly worrisome, but for some reason, Rave let out a voice full of grief, and put her hands over her face, grieving.

"You look quite depressed, don't you?"

I asked Oras, who had turned into a commentator.

"You must think the day has come when the army will take you away."

"Oh, you mean that."

She was sold as a sex slave to the military, a lie that was told to Rave.

In addition, I've never heard of the military having slaves for sex work. It's a complete myth.

But Rave is probably not familiar with the military situation, and more than anything, the trauma of being gang-raped by the Royal Army has probably prevented her from thinking about the truth.

She was standing in a cautious posture, but she began to sway so unsteadily that even from a distance she could be seen, and she sat down on the spot with her knees folded.

"Aaaaah!"

Holding her body with both arms as if she was freezing in the cold, Rave was distraught.

The memories of the days when she had been raped by the men of the royal army day after day, night after night, might be coming back to life in her brain now.

"Shut up!　You sellout!　Do you want me to hurt again?"

Doran raised one hand to shoulder height as he shouted at her.

When Rave saw this, she jumped up and down, kneeling on the spot and placing her fingers on the floor to ask for forgiveness.

"What is that?"

"It's a signal to activate the slave crest."

The slave crest is a curse-like magic that reacts to certain magical powers and inflicts pain on the person inscribed with it.

It is said to be useful in the military for torture, as it can continue to inflict pain without leaving any scars on the body.

Engraving, maintaining, and activating the slave crest. All of these require magical power, so there are almost no opportunities for commoners to get involved. If they do, it's more likely to be engraved.

Doran is not a magician, but the employee standing beside him is. I always have my magic detection spell active, so I know immediately.

It's probably a process where the magical employee activates the slave crest according to the signal from Doran, the store owner.

According to Oras, Rave, whose mind was already in a state of collapse, has rarely rebelled, so the slave crest has only been activated a few times.

But from what I saw downstairs, those few activations seemed to have left a deep scar on her mind.

I too had activated Eve's slave crest once, and she was in a lot of pain and suffering.

"Please forgive me. ...... Please forgive me. ...... Please, please forgive me. ......"

Her trembling voice was very melancholy.

I can feel that she is really scared and can't help it. Fear was no longer the only color in her mind.

"Stay like that and be quiet!"

The words were thrown wildly at her, but Rave was just relieved that the slave crest was not activated.

When Dolan saw that she had quieted down, he said in a tone of voice full of disgust.

"I'm going to put you in a cage for display. Maybe we can sell you."

Then Dolan began to tell Rave about the situation.

Recently, a merchant was arrested for illegally enslaving commoners in the city, and the kind-hearted boy nobleman was upset about it.

The young nobleman said that he was going to see for himself whether the slavers' association in Nambonan City was doing anything unlawful like kidnapping commoners, and that he was coming to visit the Gan-Oras Chamber of Commerce today.

So Doran thought of a plan to show the gentle boy aristocrat the defective stock of Rave and ask him to buy it. ...... is the setting of this play.

"He is a kind mayor, so he might even take pity on an unsold item like you and buy it."

"...really?"

Rave's voice is full of joy, as if she's been hanging by a spider's thread in hell.

"It's up to you ...... You know that, don't you?　If this doesn't sell, you'll be tortured forever. It is a life of being raped every day from morning to night, giving birth to a child that belongs to no one, and if it is a girl, both parent and child will be raped until death. If you don't want that, then do whatever you can to get them to buy you."

Doran's detailed narration of how miserable the fate would be if taken by the army shook Rave's heart.

His narration was so skillful that it seemed as if he had seen it all before, and that the military really did have sex slaves.

It's better to say that you are an unmarried daughter, so that you can attract more sympathy than a pregnant woman. It's also cheaper to raise the price.

"What?"

Rave was married in her home village and gave birth to Eve. Because of her unworthiness as a virgin, she was gang raped by the kingdom's soldiers.

In other words, what Dolan is trying to do is a scam.

"If you say so, no one can be sure. Your race is long-lived and your age can be hard to pin down, which means there's nothing wrong with you."

Eve and Rave are a race of people who are beautiful to look at, live much longer than humans, have more powerful magic than their commoner magicians, or cousins, look younger if they are 100 or 200 years old, and have long ears.

For the sake of convenience, I translated this race in my brain as the Elves, because I felt that they resembled the race that was often raped by orcs and tentacles in the Japanese fantasy of my previous life.

By the way, Eve is 12 years old and Rave is 185. I'm getting the right information from Dolan behind the scenes.

Rave, who was being lured downstairs to commit fraud, still looked like Eve's older sister.

She has pale blond hair that could be described as the color of sunlight, green eyes like Eve's, and despite her slender body and thin fingers, her breasts are swaying.

She had the impression of a calm and gentle older woman, a look that I never get tired of seeing again and again.

When he saw that Rave was having trouble speaking, Dolan said, "Or something."

"Why don't I just tell them you're a woman who's had a baby?　Maybe they won't feel sorry for you?　Where would you go if I did ......?"

Doran went on to give a real life example of how I saved a protected daughter, all thirty or so of them, all unmarried.

He went on to show that he had a track record of unmarried daughters being saved, and that this lie was something that made sense.

"...... I'm not married ......."

In a shaky voice, Rave said.

I guess she is older than Eve and can make more mature decisions, but I still think she is terrified of going to the army.

I could tell from the tone of her voice that it was an agonizing decision.

"Did you have a daughter?　No, you don't have one. You're a single woman. Am I right?"

"...... I have a daughter ......."

Rave did not receive the usual slave education by Doran.

I wanted her to miss me, but I didn't really want her to miss me because she was so steeped in the slave mentality.

So, I proposed a plan to get her to like me by saving her while pushing her as far as possible, and Doran gave her an individualized education accordingly.

After arriving in Nambonan City, Doran proposed a scenario called "disguising Rave's identity.

Right now, Rave was, let's say, a hundred percent victim without fault. If this is to be made into a slave, he said, it is likely to cause inconvenience in the long run.

It is said that this is due to the constant awareness that "I am a victim ......". It's a good argument, but depending on how it's handled, it can lead to aggravation and defection.

"What's wrong?　You don't want to tell me?　If you don't want to tell me, that's fine. It's your decision. We have no intention of putting a woman in front of the nobility who has no chance of being sold. We'll sell you to the army as planned."

This was a complete change from his previous attitude, and Dolan suddenly became cold.

If you push it, it will resist, but if you pull it, it will make you uneasy, and Rave paled.

"Wait, ......!"

"You don't want to do it, do you? You don't want to go to the army, so I took the trouble to show you the way to salvation, and you refuse it?　I'll be kind and respect your wishes. Have a good time in the army at most."

"I'll do it!　I'll do it! I'll do it! ......!"

"Will you do it? You don't have to force yourself to do it, because those who aren't prepared to do so will eventually come to blows."

When Rave seemed to be clinging to him, Dolan calmly admonished him.

The man who had been shouting at him earlier did not seem to be the same person, and he spoke in a relaxed manner.

"What do you want to do?"

At Doran's words, Rave shuddered and brought her face so close to his that she almost fell to the floor.

She then made a pained sound, as if she had squeezed it out from deep within her body.

"I don't ...... like ...... armies... So I want that nobleman to buy me......."

I can see how traumatic the gang rape experience is for Rave.

The experience of being raped over and over again in front of his own daughter's eyes was not a memory that could be easily erased.

"Well, what can I do about it then?　I'm not going to force you. You think, you decide, and you act."

Forcing someone to choose between the two worst options in a situation where there is no way out. From an outsider's perspective, there is no worse situation than this.

However, by making this choice, a drop of dirty water will be mixed in her clear watery heart.

It was the guilt of having lied about her identity and tricked her customers into buying her products.

"I am an unmarried woman. I don't have a ...... daughter."

"That's your choice, isn't it?"

"...... Yes."

A drop of sewage in a barrel full of wine turns it into a barrel full of muddy water. It reminded her of the words of a previous life.

In order to protect herself, she decided to deny the existence of her beloved daughter, Eve, and disguise her identity.

This prevents her from thinking that she is a perfect innocent victim. It will be a strong binding on her heart.

"Eve ...... I'm sorry ....... I'm ...... sorry ...... ne ...... Eve ......."

Rave burst into tears and repeated her apology to Eve, who was not here.

Perhaps I should say that by denying Eve's existence out loud, Rave had no way out.

The beauty of Rave's tearful voice as she continued to apologize to the void was inappropriate to behold.

It was a stark reminder of how much she loved Eve and how much she was afraid of going to the army.

After confirming Rave's situation, Oras and I quietly left the room.

After this, Doran would teach Rave how to flirt with the boy nobleman, so it would take a little more time before the next scene.

Oras led me to a room that looked like a reception room for upper classmen, where we drank tea and asked questions about the slave trade that we were curious about.

When I had finished asking what I wanted to know to some extent and my cup was empty, there was a knock on the door.

Oras looked at the employee who came into the room.

"What do you want?"

Oras looked at the employee who entered the room. He says everything is ready.

It seemed that my turn had finally come.

Oras was the first to stand up, followed by me.

"Let's go, then."

"Yes, lead the way."

Oras led me down the hallway of the building. The destination was the store side.

The border between the building and the store was clear, and when I opened the metal door in the middle of the corridor, I saw that the corridor had changed from stone to wood.

We walked along the wooden floor until we reached a slightly larger room.

"It's that way, sir."

"Good. Let's get started."

Slaves are displayed in the store like radishes or cabbages in a supermarket.

Basically, they are locked up in a prison at the back of the store, and people from the store bring in slaves that meet the customer's needs, meet them, and then go through the buying and selling process.

For this reason, there are often pillars and simple cages where the slaves are chained in a space where customers can enter.

The store of the Gan-Oras Chamber of Commerce was also built in such a way, with a permanent display corner.

The Rave was going to be on display as part of a final inventory sale.

This time, I was a kind-hearted boy nobleman who happened to come across such a wagon corner.

When I looked at the cage, I saw Rave staring at me, desperately trying to keep a smile on his face.

"Why are there people in here?"

I stopped in front of the cage where Rave was kept, wearing rusty handcuffs, an anklet with a round iron ball at the end of the chain, and a cheap-looking cotton robe.

The cheap robe is really disgusting because of the size of Rave's body, especially her breasts, which are all puffed up.

"It's a leftover. I'm sorry to disturb your eyes with such a defective product."

In response to my question, Oras explained reverently and with a sense of sincere apology.

He is quite a good actor.

"That's not the point. It's not that. It's just that I'm dressed like this on such a cold day. ......

"Don't worry. She is an elf, a race with magical powers, so there is no need to worry about a cold."

In addition, when you have a magical seal, you can't release your magical power, but you can still maintain your strong life force.

I listened to Oras' explanation, and my expression became slightly distorted. Of course, it was intentional, but I think my expression naturally changed due to the fact that Oras' performance was so good.

"This is the same girl ...... that you used to bring to me to sell?　I think she was treated more decently back then."

"This is the story of Doran's visit, isn't it?　At the time, I thought it would sell for a high price, but in the end, no one purchased it. ...... Just between you and me, I've already decided to sell her off. If she doesn't die before we deliver her, that's all that matters. I know it's harsh, but I can't afford to pay attention to bad inventory that I can't make money from."

As Oras rambled on about how the Rave was unsellable, the life drained from Rave's eyes as he listened to it right in front of him.

She seemed to understand from his conversation with Doran that she needed to sell herself, but she couldn't help it when Oras neglected her like this.

"You said you were going to sell it?　What sort of place would you sell it to?"

"That's an easy one. Isn't this girl beautiful to look at?　Well, in layman's terms, she is a partner for men. A loving environment, if you will."

"Hahaha," Oras laughed, but Rave had a completely dead look in her eyes.

"...... You would put a young girl like this through such a terrible thing?"

Playing the role of a nice young nobleman with a sense of justice, I shook my fist.

In response to my complaint, Oras said in a slightly scornful and provocative tone.

"That's right. After all, she can't be sold, and that's the fate of a slave. It's a shame for us, too, to think that she will be tortured day and night by countless men. ......"

"Then you should stop doing such things. ......"

"But we are also in business, and we can't afford to be naïve," said Oras, admonishingly and irresolutely.

It was like a slap in the face of reality to a naïve little boy.

"You ...... don't mind, do you?"

I call out to Rave in the cage.

She responded to my question with a quiver of her lips.

"Please ...... help me, please ......."

A single tear spilled from her green eyes, a beautiful scene like a painting that made me forget my theatricality and gulp down fresh spit.

"The name is Rave, and it was captured by the Royal Army in the Land of Mists. ...... Oh, did Doran explain this to you before?"

"Oh. I don't remember much about it. ......"

When I said this, Oras called out Rave's name in an intimidating tone.

Perhaps this meant that she should introduce himself, and Rave opened her mouth.

"My name is Rave, ....... My name is  Rave, I can read and write Eruo. I am ...... unmarried."

If the mayor buys her, she will be saved.

It was a nice follow-up for me, who had stopped acting for a moment to look at Rave.

"How much is ......?"

"Ho-ho?　Please wait a moment. ...... Dolan!"

Doran, who must have been waiting nearby, walked up nimbly.

"What's up?　Oras."

The mayor is very fond of this girl. I'd like to give her to you, but I can't remember the price, so I called you.

With his hand on his chin, Dolan made a thoughtful gesture.

You will never be able to see him from Rave's position, but he is looking at me with a smile that is truly villainous.

He seems to be a master of the art of being invisible.

"I see ... but she, Rave,., has already decided on a prior contract, and if she is to be sold it to the mayor, she would cost reasonable amount of money."

When we showed our intention to buy, he immediately raised the price.

I was beginning to think that he was not acting, but just doing it.

I'm not sure why I'm so worried about my wallet, though I'm sure I won't have to pay any new money since I've already signed the sales contract behind the scenes.

"Tell me, ....... How much?"

Then Doran told him the amount.

The price was the same as the price I had paid for Eve. In other words, the price was insanely high.

Even Rave, who was from the land of mist, seemed to understand how much it was, and she had a pale face. She couldn't believe the idea of a merchant raising the price of a product that was about to be sold.

"Rave. You don't need to be afraid."

I smiled at Rave in the cage and quickly turned back to Dolan.

"I'll take that price, open the cage."

"Thank you for your purchase, sir. Of course, I will open the cage immediately."

The door of the cage was bolted shut with an iron bolt, so it was easy to remove.

I let Dolan open the door and I approached Rave.

For a moment, Rave's back trembled loudly, as if she had a fear of men, but she struggled to hold herself together so as not to be distracted.

"Hold still, I'm taking this off you now."

The cuffs and anklets were made of iron and were not much, so I could easily rip them off with my magic power.

I destroyed the handcuffs while being careful not to injure Rave, and then destroyed the anklets as well.

Underneath the handcuffs and anklets, I could see her red, bruised skin.

Normally, Rave wears good quality handcuffs and footcuffs that are designed to prevent scratches, but today she was wearing cheap ones for this play.

"It must have been ...... painful to be so hurt. We'll heal you soon."

I concentrated my magic power and gave Rave a healing spell with a slightly enhanced light effect.

The bruises on her hands and feet were completely gone as aurora-like grains of light shone and gently caressed her body.

"Ohhhh ...... it's warm ...... thank you, thank you, thank you ......."

He was tempted to hug Rave, who was crying tears, but he didn't.

I've been informed that she has a near phobia of men. If I hug her now, there's a good chance she'll reject me.

I want to welcome her to the pervert's mansion instead of here, and then I want to take care of her and make her mine.

The way she cries is somewhat similar to Eve's, but as an adult woman, it's less childish.

In fact, I can feel the beauty in the way she cries.

I took her home with me, hoping to have a mother-daughter hug competition soon.

Chapter 139 - Eating the Delicious Mother Elf (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With Rave in the carriage, we set out for the perverted house.

Rave sat in front of me, occasionally glancing at me with anxious eyes.

I smiled at her every time, and she smiled back, as if relieved.

She seems to be worried about what will happen to her, and her dazed look is vaguely similar to Eve's.

Except for her chest, Rave is slim, but she's also reasonably tall, at least a head taller than me as a 12-year-old boy.

It's a good thing I'm not the only one who's a little scared, but I like the way she's trying to communicate with me.

After all, she has lived for a long time, and she is not just a trembling little girl.

I looked up to speak to her, but stopped myself, as if I couldn't find the courage to do so. I smiled and called out to Rave, who was repeating such a movement over and over again.

"The carriage will now go to one of my residences. I'm going to have Rave live there for a while."

"Yes, yes!"

"I'm going to take the carriage to one of my residences. They are close in age to Rave, so I think they will get along well."

It's not a surprise that there are no human girls close in age to the 185-year-old Rave. Even if there were, it would not be a girl, but an old woman who is as close to a demon as possible.

But I'm not supposed to know Rave's true age. The villainous merchant Dolan had boldly discounted Rave's age by 90%, falsely claiming that she was 18 years old, and introduced her to me for sale.

Incidentally, Rave herself has already agreed to the age fraud. I'm poking at her sense of complicity to see how she reacts.

Rave was a bit at a loss for words, but she didn't want to interrupt the conversation that had just started. She said she wanted to get to know the guardian girl, asked him how soon she would arrive at the mansion, and seemed to be consciously trying to keep the conversation going.

I didn't want the carriage to be shrouded in silence, so I gladly joined in her conversation.

"How did you get to Nambonan City, Rave?"

When I said this, Rave's face darkened and her eyes darted around as if she was having trouble speaking. It would have been terrible to speak of it, considering the disaster that had befallen her.

With my palm facing Rave, I made an apologetic face, as if I had guessed something.

"No, you don't have to tell me. ...... It must a painful story."

"Thank you for your concern about ......."

"Don't worry about it. ...... Let's put an end to this story. I won't ask again, and Rave doesn't have to force herself to say anything. I promise.

"Yes."

I'm sure I made a good impression on her when I saw her relieved expression. But the truth is, my real goal was something else.

In the future, I plan to have Eve meet Rave if she becomes attached to me. It would be a touching reunion of mother and daughter.

But as of now, Eve has not opened her heart to me. In fact, it would be better to say that she hates me.

If I were to reunite the two of them in this state, I'm sure I'd be left out in the cold. On top of that, Eve's disapproval of me might reveal the truth about the world, that Wilk is a rapist, and Rave might hate me.

Therefore, the timing of our reunion depends on Eve.

If Eve comes to have feelings for me, she won't have to snitch about her rape experience to her mother. I don't think there is any girl who would say, "The man I love is a rapist. Maybe."

Considering Eve's personality, I think it's more likely that she'll keep the fact that she was raped a secret from her mother so that she won't worry about her, but I'll be careful. I don't want the mother-daughter project to fail.

That's why I'm planning for Rave to stay in the perverted house in Nambonan City for a while.

This is where I think about what would happen if Eve were to grow old and reunite with her mother.

Eve might have some feelings about me for hiding her mother's existence from her. If I'm not careful, I might even lose the trust I've built up.

That's why I'm taking out an insurance policy.

I thought Rave was an unmarried 18-year-old girl, and I couldn't ask her about her upbringing and circumstances because she was heartbroken, so I didn't think Rave was Eve's mother,......, and that was my excuse.

There's a lot of room for complaint, like why didn't they notice that they had bought two elf sex slaves, but it's a small matter, all they have to do is call Doran and give him the script.

That's why I didn't tell Rave that she didn't have to talk about herself out of concern for her heart, but rather to prevent her from saying or doing anything that would make her feel connected to Eve.

I'm sure Rave doesn't want to talk about the past and have her lie about being an unmarried 18 year old girl, so I'm sure she won't bother to talk about it.

I couldn't help but relax my face at the fact that things had gone as I had hoped.

Then Rave smiled back at us, wondering what she misunderstood.

It was really funny to see her trying to create a good impression for me, even if just a little.

While he was having a bland conversation with Rave, the carriage arrived at the garden of the perverted house.

When Tesh opened the carriage door, the cold winter air entered the seat.

"Tesh, get Rave some clothes. She's going to be cold in this outfit."

"Very well, sir. I'll leave it to Odie.

Odie was standing behind Tesh, apparently waiting at the pervert's house.

Odie is also aware of this play, so there is no need to worry.

"This way, please, so that you can change your clothes."

Now that Rave is my property, the servants will treat her accordingly.

The servants will treat her as if she were a vase that I cherished.

Rave fumed at Odie's attitude and gave me a puzzled look.

"What?　Um..."

"You should go with Odie. We'll get you some warm clothes."

I gave her a fresh smile and sent her on her way.

Rave looked back at me anxiously as she walked into the mansion, like a little girl afraid to leave her parents.

I have my own living space in the pervert house.

While I was drinking tea in one of the rooms, Rave came in after she finished changing her clothes.

"Master, ......, thank you for waiting."

She had changed from the raggedy clothes she had been wearing earlier to clothes made of fine cloth.

A gray jacket and a long skirt dyed in a dark beige color made her pale blond hair stand out clearly. The design of the clothes was elegant and calm, and it suited her well.

"It looks good on you."

"Thank you."

I complimented her on her outfit, being careful not to focus my gaze on breasts.

I wanted to rub her, but I knew that if I did, all the hard work I had done would be for naught.

"Since we're here, why don't we meet the girls we're protecting in this mansion?

"Are you sure?"

"Yes. I'm sure Rave will be lonely."

I got up from my chair and led Rave to the room full of girls.

The pervert house is a large mansion with three houses connected by a corridor.

The innermost house is for the inner palace to enclose my woman, the middle one is for my residence, and the one closest to the main gate is the general-purpose house where the protected girls are kept.

I walked up to the room where the guardian girl was, occasionally noticing Rave walking right behind me.

When I entered the room, I was greeted with a friendly smile.

"I have someone to introduce you all to."

So I let Rave introduce herself to the girls.

Rave's beauty was a shock to them, and several of the girls sighed in admiration.

"...... Rahve has had a very hard time. I hope you all can get along."

In a way, all of the girls here were in a similar situation as Rave.

I hope that they will be able to make friends with each other and heal Rave's heart.

Besides, this protective room is filled with an air of praise for me.

It would be a blessing if she could breathe in that air and gain a little more trust in me.

Two days have passed since I bought Rave.

I still haven't held her in my arms, and I'm still in agony. In the past two days, I haven't been able to hold Rave, Kohli, Anna, or Odie.

Lately, I've been turning into a seeding machine to the point where my dick doesn't have time to dry up, and my head is hurting just living a normal life.

It's about time I hold Rave.

When I finally couldn't hold back anymore, I came to the pervert house in the evening.

I had already bathed and eaten, so all I had to do was sleep. I was wondering if she was still coming.

Just as I was wondering if she would come yet, there was a knock at the door.

Rave was standing there when I allowed her to enter the room.

"I'm sorry to bother you at this late hour."

She seemed to have just finished taking a bath, and the steam from the water was soothing her.

Her white skin was slightly tinged with red, and her still-dry hair gave off an indescribable air of sexiness.

"I don't think it's a good idea for a girl of her age to come to a place like this at night."

Rave smiles vaguely as she walks up to me, the rustling of her clothes echoing in the quiet room.

There's a hot woman's body under this cloth. I've been masturbating, and just thinking about it makes me want to ejaculate.

"I'm sorry, Master. Have you had a good night at ...... yet?"

Rave apologizes for her sudden visit, but I've been working behind the scenes to make sure she knows I'm coming.

Pretending to be a stranger, I answered Rave's questions.

"No, I was thinking of staying up a little later. ...... What do you want?"

In fact, today Rave is being taken by Tesh to the Gan-Oras Trading Company.

That is the name of the final procedure for the purchase of slaves, but in reality it is a play without me.

Tesh, who was dissatisfied when he saw that Rave still hadn't been held by the Lord, said, "I don't want a sex slave who doesn't do anything for a high price. The young master may not be angry, but I'm considering reporting him to the Master and breaking the sales contract," he said, acting to complain to Doran.

Rave, who had been taken by Oras to another room, happened to peep into it.

What will she think and what will she do? ......

The result was this night's visit. It seems that Tesh was also a performer.

"I'm not sure what to say. I just wanted to say thank you to Master."

"Yeah?"

Then Rave got down on her knees on the floor.

I approached her to stop her from that position. I didn't miss the way the fabric around her breasts loosened and the fruit swayed.

"I was going to be sold to a very painful place. Master bought me and saved me."

Rave's eyes were serious, and I could tell that she was truly grateful to me.

Doran's education is truly amazing. It's a strange situation when you're suddenly kidnapped and sold off as a sex slave, and I'm the one who bought her and is thanked for it.

"It's cold to be on your knees on a winter night, stop it."

"But ......"

"It's okay."

I try to take her hand to help her stand up, but the moment my hand reaches out, she tenses up and shakes her back.

"Oh, ......!　I'm sorry!　I'm so rude. ......"

I looked at Rave, who stood up hurriedly, and moved my expression to offer forgiveness.

Rave has developed a fear of men, but her reaction was much weaker than Doran had told me.

According to the report, Rave was so frightened by the mere approach of a man that it was unsettling to watch, and in some cases she would vomit and hyperventilate.

"It's okay, you don't have to worry about it. You can sit on the couch there at ......."

"Yes."

The combination of the awareness of being saved, the brainwashing space of the protective girls, and me, a boy on the outside but not on the inside, may have helped to alleviate some of Rave's fears.

I sit down next to her and casually turn my head to make sure that no one is nearby, and then look at her.

"I'm the one who should be apologizing. We, the people of the Kingdom of Levios, forced you to become our slaves. I'm not representing the Kingdom of Levios, but as a human being, I'd like to apologize. ...... I'm sorry, Rave."

"Oh, um..."

"You don't have to say anything. I'm really sorry."

She didn't expect me to apologize like that, and I could tell that Rave was confused.

I looked at her with serious eyes, showing her how serious I was, and then I slowly exhaled.

"...... It's just me and Rave in this room now, isn't it?　I'm a nobleman, and I don't have the opportunity to make such an apology. If my servants heard me, they would be furious with me for my dignity."

When I said, "Don't tell anyone," with a slightly frightened gesture, Rave smiled.

It's a natural smile that comes from a genuine heartfelt expression.

"...... Aristocrats have it tough, don't they?"

"Do you understand?　As the next head of the family, I have to behave in a way I'm not ashamed of. It's nice to be able to talk to Rave in such a casual way."

While acting as if he is a boy of his age and not a dignified one, he tells Rave that he means what he says.

If I'm telling the truth, I'm all for slavery because it provides me with such beautiful sex slaves.

"I'm glad my master is a kind man. Come to think of it, the girls in the mansion are also talking about ......."

Then Rave began to talk about the delusional image of Wilk that she had heard from girls who were from the pervert mansion.

I disagreed with her, occasionally laughing.

"Haha, I'm not that great of a person.

"But it's true that you saved those girls, isn't it?　They were all very grateful. So was I."

It seemed that Rave truly trusted me. There was no hint of deceit in her bright smile.

Even as we chatted side by side on the sofa, her words were full of affection for me.

I regretted that I hadn't done more preparation behind the scenes on Christmas Eve.

"...... We've been talking a bit, Rave, and I think it's time you went back to your room."

My words made Rave's expression cloudy.

"Well, you know, ......"

"What's wrong?"

She mumbled, but then opened her mouth as if she had made up her mind.

"I think I'm too sleepy to go back to my room. ......"

I guess she wasn't used to inviting men to bed, but it was an inexplicably dumb invitation.

Rave shivered in shame, her long ears red all the way to the tips of her ears.

I did a little dance in my mind and gently took her hand in mine.

Chapter 140 - Eating the Delicious Mother Elf (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A huge moon was floating in the clear night sky.

Thanks to the abundance of high quality glass in the windows, the moonlight was directly used to light the room.

The pale blue moon, reflecting the coldness of winter, calmed my heartbeat, which had been racing in anticipation of intercourse.

The bed in my room in the perverted mansion is large enough to accommodate ten people, unless you're a sumo wrestler.

Next to me, Rave was lying on the bed with a space big enough for one person.

"Maybe it's because I've just had a bath, but Rave is warm."

"Is that so?"

I wondered how I could get him to have sex with me, and I said what I was thinking.

I could feel the warmth of Rave's body next to me, and it was like having a hot water bottle.

"How about this ......?"

Then, boldly, Rave wriggled around in the blanket, came close to me and held my hand.

I couldn't help but be speechless at this unexpected action.

The warmth of her body through her nightgown was very warm.

"What's wrong, you suddenly?"

But Rave didn't respond to my voice, and squeezed out a few faint words.

"Please hold me. ......"

It was a small voice, but it was full of determination.

Rave's back and shoulders were shaking as if she was sobbing.

As I looked at her, face down, I was lost in thought.

Rave is terrified of being held by a man, yet she decides to be held by me for her own protection. It must have taken a lot of courage for her to say this.

It was a very exciting situation.

"You can't be shaking like this ...... Rave, you can't."

Don't jump at this point.

My penis is already hard enough to tear my pants, but I have to be patient.

"Please,......, the only thing I can offer my master is this,......, this,......, body. I don't want to go back to that merchant,...... please, please, please,......."

Rave clicks her teeth.

"Please don't abandon me, ...... master ......."

"Rave ......"

"I'm afraid ......, I don't want to be afraid, I want to be safe ......, I can't stand it ......, please help me ......"

Oh, I can't wait.

The tone of her voice was weak and sullen. I feel as if my brain is being caressed by a tongue.

Unlike the blue assed girl like Eve, she is able to see the reality of the situation, which is really good.

"You don't have to worry. I'm not going to abandon you. ......"

"But, but, I'm a slave for such purposes. ...... If I don't do anything, ...... I'll be sold. ......"

Then Rave caught me with her ready eyes and leaned in closer.

Her breasts pressed against my chest. I could even feel the vibrations of her shoulders shaking.

"Do you hate me ......?　I'm fine with my ...... master. So please ...... me ......."

"It's not that I don't like you, Rave. ......"

"Master ......"

I put my hand on Rave's trembling shoulder and brought my lips to hers. She seemed to understand my intentions and waited for me to open her eyes and tilt her head slightly.

"Chuu."

After a light kiss, I gently pulled Rave's shoulders into a hug.

"Oh, ......!"

Her shoulders moved with a jerk, but Rave held them back of her own volition.

I weakened my hand to just hold her close.

"It's still painful, isn't it ......?　I'd rather not. ......"

Rave forcefully took my lips and pressed her body against mine.

She kissed me lightly, just lip to lip, like she was stamping a stamp, but she repeated it over and over.

It was more to entice me than to enjoy the kiss.

"...... chu...... Rave?"

"Hold me, please."

In the middle of the bed, facing each other in the pose of nirvana, our lips slowly met again.

I put one hand on her waist and pull her close to me to show her that I'm willing to meet her request.

Then I slip my saliva-filled tongue into the space between our lips and lick her lips.

She seemed to flinch for a moment, but quickly accepted the kiss.

"If it's really hard for you, just tell me right away, okay?"

"Yes, ......."

In a prone position, I went to work on removing Rave's nightgown.

She was wearing a white shimmery one-piece undergarment, and then a gown over that.

I kissed her neck, shoulders, cheeks and forehead, and untied the knot in her gown.

"Chuu, chuu, chuu."

"Oh, ...... an, hiii, ......."

Maybe she is still afraid of sex, but she is trying her best to endure it.

When her upper body was only a chemise, I began to stroke Rave's body over the cloth.

Slowly, I crawled my fingers over her skin, tasting it through the cloth.

"Rave, we will always be together ...... and I will never lie to you."

"Mmm...... hmm......, hmm......, hmm......."

It's not so much that I'm feeling it as I'm enduring the fear.

It was as if the moment she let go of my hand, I was terrified.

There was an unusual desperation in her hands, as if she was convinced that the moment he took them away, she would fall into the depths of fear.

I repeated a few simple words to Rave: don't throw it away, don't sell it, don't let it go.

Her greatest fear is that I will abandon her and turn her into a cum dumpster, so I need to show her that I am the man to wipe that away.

It is the effect on the bed that allows me to whisper sweet, toothy words like "I will protect you".

"You're so beautiful. ......"

He put his lips on her collarbone, and she moved her head reluctantly, as if embarrassed.

He placed one hand inside the chemise from the back and moved it upwards, tracing the line of the spine.

The moist, sweaty back sucked at my fingers. I felt the freshness of a young girl's skin.

"Aaah ......n."

I was just about to move my fingers, which had reached my shoulder blades, to the front when I encountered a large obstacle.

"Oh..."

"Oh, ......."

It's chunky and overwhelmingly heavy.

It's the big tits of Rave that I've been wanting to squeeze ever since I first saw them.

"It's amazing. ......"

"Oh no ...... it's embarrassing ......"

I'm not sure if it's because of the position, but the base of the breast seems to be widening as it passes under the armpit.

I was so excited by the soft, plump feeling that I forced my hand to move to the front, pulling on the shimmies a little.

I knew I shouldn't be in a hurry, but I couldn't help but move my hand faster.

"Oh ♡"

When I wrapped my palm around the entire breast and rubbed it with my fingers, I could feel the elasticity that tried to push my fingers back.

But it wasn't a strong elasticity that refused to be held like Eve's breasts, it was soft enough to accept a man's fingers.

In a word, they were very squeezable.

"I've never had breasts this big ...... before."

My words were filled with emotion, but Rave was only embarrassed.

She let out an inarticulate squeal as she accepted my squirming.

The occasional gasp of agony was quite intriguing. The men who attacked Rave must have played with these breasts.

I try to rub them gently so that I don't irritate her emotional scars by handling them roughly.

"Rave, wow ...... warm ......."

All my attention was already on my fingertips.

I complimented Rave, not knowing what I was saying, and continued to rub her breasts.

I wanted to take off her top and rub them as hard as I could, but I wanted her breasts so badly that I didn't even bother to take them off.

Her moist breasts sucked on my fingers, changing shape and warmth with my movements.

When I slipped my fingers into her cleavage, I could feel the pressure from both sides, and my fingertips were filled with an indescribable pleasure.

My penis was fully hardened and ready for penetration, but I was engrossed in her tits like a baby.

When I tweaked the nipple, which had begun to assert its presence little by little as I continued to rub it, Rave twisted her hips and turned her head.

I thought this was my chance, so I lifted the chemise from around her lower abdomen, exposing her breasts.

"Mphm!"

I lifted the shimmies from her lower abdomen to expose her breasts.

"Haah, ...... chum!"

I munched on the two piles that appeared in a blur.

I moved my tongue as hard as I could to taste the breasts, which were too big to fit in my mouth.

"Juru, juru. "Churp, churp, churp, ...... churp, churp, churp, churp, ...... churp."

"Oh, no, ♡♡♡ no......"

Rave's arms were wrapped around the back of my head and held me to his chest, perhaps to restrain my movements.

I felt like I was suffocating, but I still wanted her breasts. I wanted to taste more of this big, warm thing, or was it instinct?

I just kept sucking on Rave's nipple, even though it wasn't producing any milk.

I was in a situation where I felt like I was suffocating, but I still wanted her breasts. I wondered if it was instinct that made me want to taste this big, warm thing more.

Even though I wasn't breastfeeding, I just kept sucking on Rave's nipples.

"Haa...... chu...... haa...... chu, chu, chu...... chu. ...... chu. Churlish ...... churlish ......."

"Oh no, phew, phew, phew. ...... Gosh, master, ...... phew, phew, ...... nothing's coming out. ...... ah, phew."

I should not be in a hurry. I know that in my head, but I can't stop it.

"Kuu ... Huh, no ... haa ... u ♡ ya ... ya ... u ... haa ... haa ..."

Gradually, Rave's breathing became more ragged, and the degree of fear seemed to be getting stronger than the pleasure.

If I continued to suck forcefully, I might stimulate Rave's trauma.

I somehow managed to pull my mouth away from her nipple and kissed her on the lips, feeling a sense of regret.

"Chuu."

"Mmm, chu ♡"

But she didn't stop rubbing her nipples. I can't stop.

"Rave, I'll protect you, so ...... chu ......"

"Chuppah, huff...... mmm, yes...... master...... please protect me...... hmm...... please......"

It was only when I held her that I realized how attractive her body was. I don't want to give her to any other man.

Every time I rub her tits, which are now sticky with saliva, I feel a surge of possessiveness inside me.

When I grabbed her shimmies with my hands, Rave seemed to understand my intentions and raised her arms as I moved, so I was able to take them off without too much trouble.

I threw the blanket under the bed, and Rave and I looked at each other on the bed.

Her bright green eyes, similar to the green leaves of summer, were glazed with beauty, and her silky skin was slightly sweaty.

Her large, plump breasts, her beautifully curved stomach, and her lower body hidden by a pair of string pants all looked delicious.

She laid on her back as he kissed her navel, midriff, arms and thighs.

"Oh, ...... you're beautiful, ...... chuckle, Rave, ...... mmm, chuuu ...... so beautiful, ...... chuuu."

"Oh ......"

The moonlight streaming in through the window sensitively illuminates Rave's naked body.

The nipples stood out as if inviting him in.

The slightly tinted nipples and their neat shape were familiar to me, but they were nothing like Eve's nipples.

The shape of the nipples was very similar to Eve's. After all, they were mother and daughter.

I covered her body and pressed my erect penis against her thigh while I took the nipple into my mouth.

"Mmm."

"Ahhhh. ............"

I caressed the nipple by moving my lips to rub it up and down, enjoying the texture.

The nipple was slightly blistered with saliva, the texture of the nipple, and the breast that received my movements like a cushion.

My hands fondled her shoulders, rubbed her hips, rubbed her buttocks over her string panties, and generally teased her.

"Ah!　Heee!　Ooh!"

My fingers reached her crotch and she shuddered loudly. I only touched her through the cloth because she still had her string panties on, but she reacted sensitively.

I wondered if it was due to trauma, but the feeling on my fingers disproved that.

Her crotch was soaking wet.

"This is ......"

"Ohhhh, ......!　No, don't say it. ......!　Don't say it!"

Her string panties were so wet that I thought she had peed her pants, and I could even make out the shape of her labia if I ran my fingers over them.

She was trying hard to hide her face, as if she was aware of this.

"Oh, I usually don't do this...! 　Oh, oh, oh —"

Rave seems to be in agony at her own lasciviousness, but for me, it's much better than being in pain.

She's all set to go, so I take off my clothes and strip naked.

I also untied her only remaining piece of clothing, her string panties, and prepared to insert them.

"Rave."

I lean into Rave, aware of the skin on skin contact.

In front of me were Rave's moist eyes and wet, glossy lips.

"Ch."

"Chuu."

I put my weight on her and kissed her deeply, letting my tongue slip into her mouth.

I tease her tongue with my own, my hands intertwine with her fingers, and we rub our skin together to enhance each other's.

"I'm so glad you're so wet, Rave. I'm glad you're so wet."

"No, don't say that ......."

"I'm so glad you accept me."

Using my fingers, I rubbed her labia lengthwise and stimulated what I thought was her clitoris with the cloth.

Rave let out a scream and turned over, grabbing my arm.

I was wondering if she had always been sensitive, or if her body had been developed during the course of being passed around by the men of the kingdom's army.

Rave was breathing hard and enduring the caresses that were being made through the cloth.

I knew that forcing her into sex might scare her, so I took my time and continued to caress her until she melted.

After confirming Rave's sweet breath, which was completely drowned in pleasure, I removed the string panties.

She was so engrossed in her caresses that she didn't seem to notice that she was completely naked.

I quickly moved between her legs and put my face to her wet clit.

The pungent scent of womanhood was in the air, and my cock was ready to mate.

"Chuu."

I kissed her slender thighs, and she tried to close her legs as if to crush my head between them. But I didn't allow her to do that, so I pried her legs open with both hands.

"Ehh... oh?　Wh- what?"

The sight of her labia, all wet and glistening in the moonlight, gave me the urge to lick them.

Her golden pubic hair, which was slightly darker than her hair, was not enough to hide her pubic area.

Her labia, which were almost open on either side, were beautifully colored, as if she was seeking a male organ.

I stretched out my tongue and pressed it against her entire pubic area with a generous coating of saliva.

"Aah!　Aah, aah ♡♡♡♡!　Aaahhh!　Yah!"

I felt a plump feeling at the base of my tongue. This was probably her vulva.

While restraining her legs from moving to escape, I narrowed my tongue and moved it to tickle the area around her vulva.

"Ahhhhhhh ♡ Ahhhhh, what's this !? Stop it, stop it, ohhhhh ♡"

Rave panted in a high-pitched voice that pierced the back of my ears.

From her reaction, this is probably the first time she's been subjected to cunnilingus, and her voice is a mixture of surprise and pleasure at the unknown experience.

The way she was bewildered and drunk with pleasure was a man's dream come true.

The vaginal opening reacted to the stimulation given, repeatedly opening and closing its opening.

Each time it opened and closed, it seemed to expel lewd air from her vagina, which pleasantly stimulated my nostrils.

"Ahh ...... ah ah ...... haha♡ haha ...... ah♡"

My penis was on the verge of ejaculation. I finally prepared my body for insertion.

In the normal position, the penis was so erect that it was difficult to insert, and the angle was so high that I was worried that it would sink into my stomach.

The masturbation effect was frightening.

"Rave, I want to insert it."

"Oh ......"

I give her the best look I can muster as I make her spread her legs into frog position.

The tip of my cock was already pressed against her vulva, ready for penetration.

"I'll take responsibility. Trust me."

I put my face to Rave's, being careful not to insert it.

She slowly closes her eyelids in silence, perhaps in affirmation, perhaps to endure.

But I don't have time to think about it. I could no longer hold back my desire to fuck her.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 141 - Eating the Delicious Mother Elf (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No matter what Rave's thoughts were, her body was always ready to take a dick into her mouth.

This is a mature female body, after all, and the whole atmosphere has changed to sex mode.

Her daughter, Eve, always accepts my sex in normal mode, so the difference is easy to see.

"Fuuuuu"

When I groped the ceiling of her vagina with my fingertips, Rave reacted as if she had been electrocuted.

It was like playing a musical instrument well, and I lost myself in her caresses.

I immersed myself in her caresses.

"Aah ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"

Rave gripped my arm tightly and squealed in a high-pitched voice.

The caresses softened and loosened her wet vagina.

I think it's safe to send the main army in now.

"Haha ...... Haha, Rave, take it ......"

"Master, ......"

I slowly inserted my cock, which was on the verge of exploding, into her vaginal opening.

Her vagina was a very hot place for my glans, which was a little cold from overflowing with my juices. It was as warm as if she was pissing herself.

"Ohhhh ...... ahhh ......♡"

With a mixture of sadness and pleasure in his voice, Rave clutched the sheet and endured my insertion.

"Ugh ......, it's so hot inside you ......."

"Agh ...... is so hard ......"

She hid his face with a pillow and screamed in agony.

I'm an innocent boy of twelve, and although my penis is still growing in size, I am absolutely confident in its hardness and angle when erected due to youth and sexual desire.

It seemed that Rave was surprised and impressed by the hardness of my penis.

"Ooooh ...... so hard ......, so hard ......♡ ah ......♡ so hard ......"

I thought about how her ex-husband probably had squishy little dick, but I moved on into Rave.

When I felt the glans reach the very back, I pulled my face to hers and gave her a powerful hug and kiss.

If I rushed my movements, I might ejaculate immediately, so I proceeded slowly with each movement.

"Chu ♡ Chuu ......"

"Chuu ......, do you understand?　Now I'm one with Rave."

Her vagina tightens.

I'm not sure if it's because she's aware that she's connected to me, but her vulva closes over and over again in small increments. She seems to be trying to squeeze the seed out of me right away.

I wanted to enjoy Rave's insides more, so I ignored her request and took an immobile position.

As I stroked her beautiful, scarless stomach, I could feel the hardness of her muscles underneath the soft flesh as she seemed to be working on her abdominal muscles.

I kissed her skin as I placed my hand on her well toned neck.

"Chuu, chuu... ......"

As I was crushed by the vaginal walls, I was filled with the desire to continue tasting Rave's body.

The vagina, full of all-encompassing tenderness, caressed my penis in a tantalizingly sweet way.

Enjoying the caress without moving, I tried my best to stay as hard as I could.

Rave's heat, transmitted by the close contact of mucous membranes, made my penis hotter.

"Mmm...... haha ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ......!"

"Mmm ......!　Ugh, hah......!"

I noticed that the tip of my dick was numb and I couldn't put any strength into my knees or hips.

It's like a diluted version of the pleasure you get after ejaculating.

I had a hunch that my semen, which had accumulated in abstinence from masturbation, was succumbing to Rave's vagina and dripping down.

The image of semen spilling out of the tip of my penis and into her sluggishly, like overflowing juice, ran through my brain.

"Agh!　Aaah!　Rave, gghhhh, hahahaha ......!"

I was already at my limit.

If you've already started cumming, there's no point in continuing to hold back.

I want to unleash it all.

"I'm sorry, but I'm going to cum into you. I want to come inside you.　I'm going to ......!"

"Mmm!"

"Take it, ......ggg!　Ugh!　Ggh!"

Szzzzzz sssssss

Rather than firing off a shot, it might be better to say it was pouring it in.

The semen must have already come out first, and rather than releasing it, I could feel the sensation of sending more out from my penis.

The large amount of semen that was stored in me was sucked deep inside her.

I want to make Rave mine alone. I can't stop ejaculating.

"Ahhhh ... it's coming out ...?"

"Rave ......!　Rave ......!"

I thrust my hardest ejaculating penis deep into Rave's vagina.

I want to pour as much semen as I can into her. I let my instincts take over, and with my head still blank, I just pressed my hips against her.

"Rave...... ah...... Ku...... Rave......"

"Oh ...... ugh ......"

I gave my lower body one last squeeze to squeeze out the remaining semen.

My penis seemed to be satisfied that the first fuck was finally over, and it slowly softened.

"Rave ......"

"...... hii...... n, chu♡"

I stretched my neck towards Rave, who was taller than me, and our lips met.

Her moist, wet lips tasted really good as a post-sex dessert.

"I'll be with you for the rest of my life,...... chuuu,...my Rave,.."

"Huh...... chu, an♡ chu...... chu."

My softening penis is kept in her. It's a plug to prevent semen from overflowing.

My penis is drowning in a sea of expelled semen.

My brain was filled with unspeakable pleasure as I felt like I had marked her vagina, my desire for conquest fulfilled.

"Haha...... haha...... Rave, that was good......"

"......Huh......Huh......Master......"

Rave stares at me with sad eyes. I gently stroked her cheek.

"If you have a child, I will protect you and your child."

I kissed her on the cheek and smiled.

"Really, ......?"

"Yes, mother and daughter together."

I take her hand and intertwine our fingers as I repeat the kiss on the cheek.

I guided her hand to the joined genitals and let her confirm the connection.

"I'm not going to be so outrageous as to throw away my unmarried daughter."

"...... Yes."

I embraced Rave gently, who looked a little pensive.

"Rave?　What's wrong?"

"No, it's nothing. That ...... made me feel relieved. ......"

"Is that so?　Well, that's good. ......"

The phrase "unmarried daughter" may be bothering her, but I don't give her any room to talk about it.

I hug her tightly.

"Will you give birth to my child?"

"...... Yes. Please stay ...... with me forever. Master."

I'm sure she was speaking out of self-preservation, not wanting to be sold off to someone else.

But the dim, fragile tone of her voice made me writhe as my heart shot out of my chest.

The fact that she was so small, with no one to rely on but me, excited me so much.

"Of course. I won't let anyone else have you, my Rave."

"Oh ......♡"

There was a sigh of relief from Rave.

Maybe she could finally believe that I wasn't going to sell her out.

We hugged side-by-side, and I pressed my lips to Rave's, moist and deep, as if to say, "This is a pledge of love.

Rave seems to have calmed down a bit, and her tongue flirts with my kiss, but only a little.

"Chu, chu, chu. ......"

"Huh, chu ♡ chu...... chu...... master...... chu."

Every time she responds to the movement of my tongue, making a sizzling sound and exchanging saliva, the vitality builds up in my penis.

My penis, which should have been drowning in a sea of semen, quickly regained its hardness and swelled to keep up with the vaginal pressure.

"Oh ......, it's getting hard again ......."

It seems that Rave, who was still inserted, also felt the hardening of his penis.

He had just ejaculated, but he didn't feel it at all. He laughed a little, feeling the splendor of his young body.

"I'm sorry, ...... Rave, you're so cute. May I try again?"

Already in position for the second round, I looked at Rave and said.

Perhaps caught by my smile, she made a kind smile and nodded her head silently. The movement was so cute that it filled my heart with joy.

I bit her long ear, which was stretched out to the side, with my lips.

"Hmm."

"Ahhhhh ♡ Ahhhhh ♡"

Eve was felt too fierce when I attacked her ears, but Rave let out a meltingly sweet voice.

He begins a leisurely pistoning motion using only his hips while humping her ear with his lips.

The semen that had already filled her up was flooding her, making a disgusting sizzling sound.

"Oh♡♡♡♡ Stop, please stop my ears. ......"

"Haa, haa, haa, haa, haa ......, haa ......!"

Even though the quality is good, if you move your hips too hard, the bed will make a small screeching sound.

The sound of semen spurting from the vagina, the creaking of the bed, and the ragged breathing of the man and woman echoed well in the quiet room.

"Aaah, ah ♡ ah ♡ ah ♡ ah ......"

Maybe it was because of the second round, but even with the continued pistoning, there still seemed to be some room left for ejaculation.

You can feel the sticky texture of Rave's vagina through the slightly dulled glans.

The feeling was so good that I was shaking my hips, not caring about fatigue.

"Kufu, Fu, Rave, Fu, Fu, Fu, Rave"

"Hmmmmmm ♡ Hafufufu ..., U, Uh ...Master ..."

The lower half of my body, which had been moving without a break, eventually screamed.

Her forehead was covered with sweat, and the skin that rubbed against each other was incredibly hot.

"Oh, Rave, it's coming out!　I'm coming out again!　You'll have to take my baby. ......!

"Wow ♡ Ahh ♡"

Fresh semen pours into Rave's vagina again.

The vagina is covered in semen and there is no room to pour, but my seed is jumping up and down in search of a little space.

My penis continued to pump out semen as if it were trying to take her eggs.

"Ugh. ......!　Ugh!　It's coming out ......!　Rave......!"

My whole body stiffened, and I buried my head in Rave's chest as I collapsed.

There was the most supreme softness in the world.

"Haa...... haa...... haa......."

Pressing my cheek against her chest, I tried to regulate my breathing, which had been disrupted by the pistoning and ejaculation.

Then Rave put her hand on the back of my head and held me gently. Her arms were filled with a gentle emotion that resembled a mother's love.

I was unconsciously guided by her gentleness and sucked on the tip of her breast, a symbol of motherhood.

"Chuuuugh!"

"Ugh ......♡"

Rave pats me on the back and says, "Good, good."

Her hands are those of a mother caring for her child. I decided to take advantage of her kindness.

As I did with Odie, there is something very comforting and satisfying about being pampered by a woman with big tits.

After that, I got an erection several times and had to shake my hips each time.

At the end of the night, I finally couldn't produce any semen. Youth is a great thing to be able to ejaculate six times in just one night.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 142 - Mother Elf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My heart beat faster as I heard a pounding on the door.

I have heard this sound for three days in a row now, and there is no one else who visits this room.

I checked my hair and nightgown in the mirror in the room and answered the door.

"I'm coming in."

"Yes."

A boy with blue hair and silver eyes, my "master," opened the door and walked in.

I was surprised to hear that he was only twelve years old, as he usually acted very dignified.

"Rave, I've missed you."

"Are you sure?"

Master came to my room with a big smile on his face.

I remember when the slaver took me to see him for the first time, I felt a little scared because of the disproportion between his beautiful face and sharp eyes.

But the way he was smiling at me was that of a 12-year-old boy.

As I've come to be afraid of grown men, a master who is old enough to be my son is a comfort to me.

"It's true, of course. Rave......"

"N...... chu♡"

I kissed Master, who leaned toward me and stretched his neck.

His tongue moves for me, and I respond with my tongue.

"Chupu...... chupu...... hmpu."

"Chub ...... chu ...... puh."

When I parted my lips, the saliva dripped downward in a thread.

One thing that is troubling is that the master's sex drive is very strong.

I never thought that I would be held by such a young boy.

"How was your day, ...... Rave?　Are you having a hard time?"

It's been about five days since I arrived at the mansion.

Every time I see Master, he asks me how I'm doing. I was very happy to hear his concern.

The pain I was feeling was nothing compared to the time I was in the slave trade. I was saved by being bought by Master.

"I'm fine. Thank you, Master."

I have hot meals, clean clothes. I even get to take a bath every day, and I even get a room in this big house.

I don't think there are many slaves who are as fortunate as I am.

One wrong move and I would've been in the army. ......

"Hmm?　What's wrong?　You look so sad. ......"

"I'm sorry ....... It's just that it reminded me of the past. ......"

I shouldn't have done that. I've made Master worry. He'll think I'm dissatisfied with my current life.

I hurriedly tried to open my mouth, but he put his index finger on my lips.

"It's okay. You don't have to say anything. You just need to relax and let your mind heal."

......

I could feel the receptive power of a grown man from Master in such situations.

I took him at his word and decided to keep my mouth shut.

"Yes, good girl."

Master's arms reached out and hugged me, as if he was trying to comfort me.

Master was still growing and was shorter than I was.

It's not like a man and a woman hugging each other, but more like a parent and a child interacting.

Parent and child. It's a word that makes me depressed.

I lied to my master about my identity. I lied to my master that I am an unmarried daughter.

When I was living in the village, I was married and had a child.

I feel really bad and distressed for the master who cares for me.

I thought many times about confessing everything to him, but I couldn't do it.

If my master were to find out that I was married and had a child, he would be furious and send me back to the slavers. ...... Just thinking about that makes me unable to say anything.

If you listen to the stories of the girls in the mansion and see how Master has been behaving over the past few days, you will know that he is not the kind of person who would do such a thing.

But what if, really what if, he hates me? ...... Just thinking about that dark future makes me cringe and feel like I can't breathe.

I was so afraid of being hated by my master.

"Please don't abandon ...... me, Master ....... Please don't abandon ...... me. Please don't abandon ...... me."

"Yes. Okay, Rave."

I said the same thing again. Whenever I feel nervous, I can't help but check.

I said the same thing over and over again, but Master never got angry and replied to me. I can't tell you how much that has saved my life.

"I'm ...... happy with you, master. ...... That's why I'm ......"

Happy.

Is that really so?

I've been able to find a kind master. ...... But what about Eve?

I wonder how my precious, really precious daughter, Eve, is doing now.

I am sure that she has been enslaved just like me.

Maybe she's crying because she was taken to the same harsh environment that I was almost sent to. I might be crying and screaming as I am forcibly raped by a man I don't know.

Just thinking about it doesn't make me happy from the bottom of my heart. I should not be the only one who is happy.

And yet, I tell my master that I am happy.

In order to protect myself, I have to be liked by my master. I don't want to go back to the slavers. That's why I flirt with him.

"...... Yeah. It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry."

Master seems to see through the fact that the words "happy" do not come from the heart.

I think he's waiting for the time when I'll get the courage to tell him.

I think he's a very mature boy, even though he's the same age as Eve.

Masters' species have a shorter life span than ours. Perhaps that's why their minds are growing so fast.

"Rave, let's sit down for a while."

I was led to a nearby sofa and sat down.

Master followed me and sat down at a distance where our thighs were perfectly attached.

"...... chu."

"Mmm, chu ♡"

Master likes to kiss. He puts his lips together in some way.

My husband, who fought to protect our village and was killed by soldiers from the Kingdom of Levios, was sexually indifferent, so I was a little confused by Master's sexuality.

There was no way I could forget my husband. But it's also true that in just a few days, Master's presence has grown in my heart.

"...... Rave."

"Please be gentle, okay?"

And the master likes breasts anyway.

He called my name in a slightly embarrassed tone, and then nuzzled his face into my chest.

"Haa......Rave......."

It's a little bit cute that the master has a sweet voice.

In front of the servants, the guards, and the girls he protects in the mansion, he is reliable and even dignified, but when he is alone with me in this room, he spoils me like this.

I think he's a little like Eve in this way.

She was also a strong girl outside the house, but when she came home, she was all sweet to me and my husband.

When I'm petting my master like this, I can't help but be reminded of Eve, partly because they are so close in age.

"Oh, it's so big now ......."

The cloth of Master's pants, buried in my chest, was puffed out.

Master really has a huge sex drive. I know this because we've had a lot of skin on skin in the past three days.

I was sold as a sex slave, so I don't know what will happen to me if I don't fulfill my role. Having made that decision, I was halfway embraced by my master as if he were attacking me.

Suppressing the feeling that I was about to vomit when I remembered the day I was defiled by the royal army, I cornered my master.

I was prepared for the fact that he would probably mess me up if I got excited, at least at first.

However, Master was very kind to me and acted as if he cared about me.

I was glad that a boy smaller than me cared for me, and my fear of sexual intercourse eased a little.

In the end, I don't remember how many times I received semen that day.

Master's way of holding me was ...... unlike anything I had ever experienced before.

I was so confused between feeling scared and feeling good that I don't even remember what I did at the end.

From the next day on, Master came to my room at night to perform the act of procreation.

I felt a terrible sense of relief that I was able to become his favorite, and self-loathing that I had invited such a young boy of his age.

But this is the way I will live my life.

With the village gone, I had nowhere to go, and even if I escaped from here, I would be surrounded by the Kingdom of Levios.

If that's the case, I want to live peacefully under a kind master.

"I can't help it. ...... It's because Rave is cute."

"...... ah ♡"

A fingertip slipped into my underwear and stimulated my weak spot.

I couldn't help but scream.

I would have to make a baby again today.

It is said that procreation is very important to the nobility, and women who have children are treated with great respect. Master Tesh said that this is true even for slaves.

If you have a baby, you can visit .......

I wonder if I will be able to muster up the courage. Will I be able to tell Master about Eve?

Pressing my trembling fingertips against the sofa, I hid my agitation from Master.

I might be a bad mother, taking advantage of the baby I was going to have with Master.

It would also be an act of betrayal of Master's trust.

I can't say anything right now.

I'm too scared to say it.

You can use your kind master to help you find Eve and save her. ......

You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.

Eve ....... My little girl.

Hopefully, she will be bought by a kind person like her master.

I prayed to the spirits in my heart.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 143 - Preparing for departure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are less than half a month left in this year.

I am scheduled to leave for New Nellie City tomorrow.

At the mayor's mansion and the pervert's house, the newly hired servants were hurriedly preparing for my return.

"You're looking much better."

"Kuh. ......"

When I came to Kohari's room in the perverted house, she was sound asleep.

I casually stroked her forehead and she smiled in her sleep.

On the day I welcomed Kohari into the perverted house, I visited her room with my cock hard, but she was not feeling well.

She seemed to be exhausted both physically and mentally from the preparations for her marriage and the move, and had caught a cold.

I was going to embrace her while appealing to Kohari, who was feeling anxious about his new environment, as a dependable man. I didn't think it was a good time to call Anna, so I spent a lonely night alone.

The timing was not good, and I couldn't hold Anna again the next day, so I had to agonize over it, but in the end, I was able to 120% enjoy my first sex with Rave because of the two-day masturbation ban. This is what it means to turn disaster into good fortune.

"Don't worry, Kohari is almost well again."

When I stopped nudging her forehead, an old woman opened her mouth.

"Well, thank you for your trouble."

"I'm glad to see you are so kind, young master. At this rate, I'm sure she'll have a baby soon, and I'll be very happy. Hee hee!"

The old woman who smiled with a short, high-pitched laugh that sounded like hiccups was Kohari's bodyguard.

She is over 90 years old and has wrinkled skin like a paper balloon that has lost its air.

Her words and movements were relaxed, characteristic of an old woman, but her every move was dignified. She was not at all self-conscious about paying her respects to her lord, and her movements were very natural.

She is not just an old woman, but an old woman from a knightly family. She looks like this, but she has magic power and has been a military officer in her family's army.

"I'd like to ask you to refrain from sharing a bed with me for a while longer. I'm sick."

"Yes, I know. I'm only visiting.

When a nobleman's son impregnates a commoner, the child is often adopted by a knightly family.

This is because the children of the main ancestor and the slave ancestor are always the children of the subordinate ancestor, that is, the child with magic power.

The knight family cannot survive without magic power, so securing a squire is the most vexing problem for knights.

Except for the main ancestor, only a combination of a squire and a squire can produce a squire's child.

For this reason, the knights in the territory sometimes hold matchmaking parties where only the children of the squires are gathered.

In their own way, they are desperate to protect their family.

In the knightly families, protecting the family name is more important than the bloodline, so adoptions are rather frequent.

There are a number of knight families in the Quardenze territory, but if you were to create a family tree, it would probably look like a bizarre pile of spider webs. That's how deep the blood relationship is between the knight families in the territory.

According to the book, the knight system in the continent of Eruo began when nobles entrusted part of their land to the children of their concubines.

If you consider the hereditary relationship of magic power, I think this theory is quite plausible, and in fact, if you trace the family tree of the knight family upward, you will almost always find the lord nobleman.

For this reason, there is no resistance to a knight adopting the child of his lord's concubine. In fact, they would even boast that it is a sign of trust.

On the other hand, for the concubine as well, this adoption is a good deal.

The most stable life for a commoner on the continent of Eruo is to live on the side of the ruler.

If you belong to an overwhelmingly powerful noble family, the chances of being treated unreasonably are almost zero as long as you stay within their territory.

From the commoner's point of view, when a child is adopted by a knight family, it is as if a bright future has already been confirmed.

You can become a military officer or a civil servant, and it is unlikely that a person with magic power who has acquired the culture of the knight family will be unhappy.

"Miss Kohari is very beautiful. I can understand why you would want to visit her."

A little while ago, I put out a call for any knightly families who could provide an escort to Nambonan City.

It's not only Anna, who is a member of the council, but also Kohari, who has the opportunity to go out, needs an escort.

So the first to raise their hand was the Evermill family, the family of the old guard. As soon as they were recruited, they formed a team of guards before any other knightly family.

As a matter of course, there is only one knight family that can adopt a child.

In the case of the Quardenze family, they have adopted a system where only the head of the knight family who has acquired the right to negotiate can propose adoption to the mistress.

The Evermills were evaluated by my father for providing a team of guards, and were given the right to negotiate the adoption of a child to be born in Nambonan City.

However, there was no guarantee that the adoption would actually take place even if they were granted the right to negotiate.

Not only if I oppose it, but also if the mistress refuses, it will not happen.

The old lady is doing her job as an escort, and she's also doing stealth marketing of the advantages of Evermill City so that she can use it as a positive factor in her decision when it comes time to negotiate the adoption.

Whenever she talks to Anna about Evermill City, she seems to get twice as many responses about Nambonan City, so the old lady is wondering about her future advertising policy.

"...... hmm?"

"Hmm, I must have woken you."

The conversation between the old lady and me must have woken Kohari up, and her large red eyes fluttered open.

Kohari, who had been asleep for several days now, looked a little tired.

The old guard smiled silently and moved to a corner of the room to assume a more reserved posture.

I guess she wanted me and Kohari to enjoy our private meeting.

"Kohari. I'm glad you're feeling better.

Healing magic is so convenient that it can easily cure illnesses, but commoners don't use it often.

I don't know what the logic behind it is, but it seems that when a disease is cured by magic, it doesn't build up immunity, and if there's a chance, the disease will strike again, and it's likely to be more severe.

Therefore, if there is someone nearby who can use healing magic, as Kohari did this time, natural recovery will be prioritized, and when it is really hard, healing magic will be applied to restore strength or ease the symptoms a little.

In the case of the main ancestor and the secondary ancestors, they do not get sick in the first place, except when they are infants or young children whose magic power is not stable, so they cast healing spells without worrying about immunity.

I had a cold once when I was a child, but I remember that my mother cast a healing spell on me and I was cured in an instant.

"Hmmm ...... mayor ......?"

"That's not right."

"Master Wilk......."

I told her to call me by my name when we were in the pervert house.

I kissed Kohari lightly on the cheek and complimented her on being able to call me by my name.

"I missed you, Kohari."

I approached Kohari, who was still lying down, and stroked her hair.

It was a little shaggy, probably due to the fact that he hadn't taken a bath, and it didn't have the usual pleasant touch.

"You did a good job. Is there anything you want?""

In a previous life in Japan, I would have bought you some canned peaches, but unfortunately, canned food doesn't exist in the continent of Eruo.

The pioneer society has invested a lot of money in developing canned goods, but so far they have not been able to produce any satisfactory products.

I gave a soft touch to Kohari, who had just woken up and was not thinking clearly, and waited for her answer.

"What do you want?"

"Yes. You've been sick for a long time, haven't you?　I want to celebrate your recovery.

"Oh. I know you've been sick.　I'm celebrating your recovery."

I want to be told that she needed my dick.

......

Then Kohli blushed and covered the lower half of her face with the blanket.

I don't think she really wants a cock.

"I want that ...... turtle...... thing they sell in New Nellie City.

"Yeah?"

As I had seen before when I went on a market date with Minith, turtle shell work is a specialty of the New Nellie area.

Compared to New Nellie, there are not as many people wearing turtle ornaments in Nambonan. Maybe they don't produce them in this area.

But I'm not quite sure what Kohari wants. What is this thing with turtle work in it?

From Kohari's embarrassment, I'm sure it's some kind of erotic item, but I can't think of anything.

The old guard seemed to have noticed that I wasn't getting the idea. The old lady, who was waiting in the corner of the room, put two fingers together and made a rubbing motion on her arm, then pointed to the blade of the sword on her hip.

Ah, razor blades.

Come to think of it, Kohari's pubic hair is still growing.

This is the status of an unmarried or unengaged woman, which is not in line with Kohari's current position.

Maybe she has been waiting for me to give her a razor blade.

If that's the case, I'm sorry. I'll make sure she shaves for me. Now that she was my concubine in name and reality, I had to take full responsibility for her.

"Oh, okay. I'll give you something beautiful."

She wanted something that was not a luxury item, but something that was within the reach of the average citizen, so perhaps the naïve young lady was beginning to understand the value of money.

"I'm looking forward to ......."

I'm glad I could spoil her.

I couldn't help but hug her as she was so adorable.

"Oh ......♡"

I would have liked to plant a seed in her before we left, but she was too sick to do that.

I'll have to quell my erect cock elsewhere.

"Ugh, Anna ......, I'm coming out ......."

I hadn't seen Anna in a long time, as she had been busy with the council lately or something.

I hadn't seen her in a while, and I wanted to give her one last spanking before I left Nambonan City.

She was in a standing position, her hands on the wall, her head facing me, and her lips on mine.

I want a lot of it, a lot of it.

"I want it all.　Aah!"

I poured a generous amount of my seed into Anna, who was completely ready to accept it.

Anna's panting voice echoed well in the stone council chamber, and the semen flowed in a steady stream, as if she was used to it.

"Haa...... haa...... ♡ like...... mayor, chu♡"

"Mmm, chu. Anna, I like you too. Ugh...... ugh......"

After ejaculating until I was completely empty, I withdrew my penis.

Since she was playing in her clothes, semen started to drip from between her skirt. This is really erotic and good.

While I was watching the scene with satisfaction, Anna got down on her knees in front of my semen-covered penis and started cleaning it.

Unlike Minith and Odie, whose blowjob skills were taught to them by the head maid, Anna's clean-up blowjob was taught to her by me.

Watching her perform the erotic acts I had trained her to do, I felt a sense of satisfaction fill my chest.

I can't get enough of the feeling of accomplishment that comes from knowing that I've raised a woman to be a dirty little bitch.

"...... Hmm?"

"What's wrong?"

Anna, who had been sucking my cock with a smile, raised her eyebrows.

"I'm not sure. It's a little ...... thin, maybe."

Last night, and this morning as well, I was squeezed by Rave as soon as I woke up.

No matter how young my body is, it is indeed not possible to recover that much at noon.

It's no wonder Anna feels so thin.

Recently, I've been ejaculating a lot of semen, feeling like I'm in some kind of deficit.

The testes, desperately producing semen beyond their limits, have now become a complete black business.

I can't help but feel sorry for the management and the testicles that are being used for the pleasure of the brain.

"I'm glad you remembered how I tasted."

"Mmmm ...... chu♡"

I didn't mention why it was thin, but praised Anna for tasting my semen so well.

Anna kissed the glans to finish the cleaning and started to clean herself up.

She wiped the dripping semen off with a cloth and fixed her messy clothes and hair, a gesture that I loved to watch. It was like an after-dinner dessert.

"Um, Mayor ....... , are you sure you're okay to continue as a member of the council?　I've been given a room in your mansion. ......"

"Hmm?　No, there are examples of people working outside the city, so there is no problem. I've got an escort as well.

The image of a concubine is one of being kept in a tight circle, but in reality, concubines are quite flexible.

This is because the sexuality of aristocrats is very sensitive, and the parents as well as the servants will try to accommodate the child's sexual tastes as much as possible.

The reason why parents provide money for sex is because they want their children to be sexually active.

A very famous example of parental consideration is the episode of the nobleman's son who loved the daughter of a knightly family.

The nobleman's son fell in love with the sight of the knight's daughter fighting on the battlefield, and became obsessed with the idea of mingling in the open air after a battle.

When his parents learned of this, they took the trouble to find the bandits and ordered their son to go and defeat them.

The parent's plan was a great success, and the son, who was not fond of sex, eventually fell in love with 20 daughters of the knightly family and took them as his concubines.

In this way, they succeeded in making him have nearly a hundred children.

In addition, the battlefield seems to be an important factor in increasing sexual desire.

Even aristocrats who are sensitive about their sexuality sometimes unintentionally ravish women in the excitement of battle.

There is even a theory that the original purpose of a nobleman's first battle is to rape a village girl to awaken his sexuality.

There are many such stories in aristocratic circles.

You can clearly see how much importance is placed on procreation.

The reason why Anna is able to continue working as a councilor or in the tavern is quite simple: "Young Master seems to have an erection at the sight of you being active. Then we must support her."

In a way, it's true.

It is more attractive for Anna to shine brightly in a public place than to be a doll in a mansion.

If you're going to eat, it's you might as well want to eat at the best places.

"It seems like there are a lot of young girls in the house. ...... I wonder if I've been forgotten."

As she had worked in a tavern for many years, Anna was very good at making charming gestures.

She is good at expressing her concerns in a tone that does not sound jealous.

Anna was 26-years-old, and she would be concerned if Kohari, who was a year younger than her, was in the house. And then there were the protective daughters.

Regardless of how I feel about it, a 26-year-old woman is considered an old woman in the continent of Eruo.

"You don't need to worry about such trivial matters. Even if Anna says she doesn't want to, I will never let her go, so don't worry."

There was no way I was going to let go of a woman who had soaked up so much of my body fluids.

I forcefully embrace Anna and show her that I will never let her go.

The smell of semen wafting through the air was unbearably painful, but I had to endure it because it was what I had produced.

T~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 144 - Civil Servants and Merchants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I left the council chamber and headed for the mayor's residence.

My next visit to Nambonan City was scheduled for after the new year.

As I entered the mayor's office, civil servants and staff members came to me one after another with matters that they wanted to take care of before the end of the year.

Most of them were just confirmations, though, so I had very little to do.

After drinking the tea that Odie had prepared, I put down my brush and stretched my arms high.

"I got this information from a merchant......."

The person who said this was a civilian official of the military in Quardenze.

He was sitting on a nearby sofa, organizing his documents, perhaps waiting for me to catch my breath.

"It seems that there are secret purchases of food and weapons all over the old Voistra. There are quite a few of them. There may be a large scale offensive before spring."

Naturally, to start a war, supplies are needed.

As soon as they started buying them, rumors would spread no matter how they were hidden.

The civil servants also have many opportunities to communicate with merchants, so they sometimes hear rumors. If anything, the more the rumors spread, the better for the merchants. The more the rumor spreads, the better it is for the merchant, because it leads to a chance to sell food and weapons.

Some of them would say, "Sir, the neighboring territories are buying up weapons.　Maybe they will attack us. Oh, yes, actually, I also deal in weapons and provisions. What do you think?　I'll give you a discount for the husband you've been taking care of, okay?　Hee hee! There are some merchants who will tip you off to .......

This time, it was not the arms dealer's sales talk, but an oil merchant who frequented the city hall, who told the civil servant, "Oh, by the way, there is a rumor about this."

"What do you mean, "quite a few"?"

"Here's a summary."

One of the civil servants stood up and brought the document to the mayor's desk. It seemed to have been written on a new wooden board, and although the letters were small and crowded, they were clear and easy to read.

"Oh, you've bought a lot."

The estimates of the amount of purchases were listed in a range, but even the lowest estimate seemed to be enough to move a decent-sized army.

"I asked for help from the Nambonan merchants to gather information. I think our accuracy is higher now."

They seemed to have their own ideas, as I heavily favored Rumon for his skillful use of the merchant network.

It seems that the civil servants, with Rumon's guidance and advice, have begun to build a new cooperative relationship with the Nambonan merchants.

There are many merchants in Nambonan who are familiar with the area around the old Voistra, so it was not too difficult to gather this information.

"I'm glad to see that you are making good use of the merchants, as well as the results of this investigation. It was also a good decision to seek the advice of Rumon."

Rumon would be just the right balancer between the civilian and merchant sides.

The civil servants, who looked a little relieved, opened their mouths in unison.

"I've already sent word to your lord and General Galfis. I hope you will take note, young master."

"It's clear to everyone that in the spring, the Quardenze army will be in full swing. It is quite possible that this purchase is in preparation for a siege. But ......"

"As Rumon once said, the economic exhaustion of the former Voistra, including the city of Ocellaria, seems to be more severe than we expected. We have decided that it would be dangerous to conclude that this is a purchase for defense."

The civil servants sitting on the sofa began to explain, as if to say that this was the result of joint research.

After interviewing a number of Nambonan merchants, they discovered that they were buying far more provisions than they had heard about.

Perhaps they saw this as an opportunity to flatter the civilian officials of the Quardenze army, and the Nambonan merchants took the opportunity to disclose valuable information to them.

"Where do you think they'll attack?"

In the past twelve years, I have learned a fair amount about armies and warfare.

But I have memories of my previous life as a commoner in peaceful Japan. I was always afraid of the possibility of making a wrong decision based on unconscious assumptions.

For this reason, I always seek the opinions of those around me when it comes to military, political, and noble matters, and reconcile them with my own thoughts.

"The only important places in this area are the frontline base that General Galfis is building and Nambonan City. If we want to be realistic, we should capture or destroy the frontline base."

"Yes, there's no way we'd be foolish enough to ignore the frontline base and head for Nambonan City. It is inevitable that they will be destroyed by a pincer attack from General Galfis and the Nambonan garrison."

"In addition, a frontline base is like a spear pointed at the Voistra plains, and should be an eyesore for the old Voistra."

"Yes, if the castle falls with the outpost as a foothold, they will never be able to pass the night in peace again.

There are three main types of opponents that the Quardenze family is currently fighting.

The first is the current Imperial Dukes, who used to reign as the royal family of the Kingdom of Voistra. This is the one that my grandfather wants to destroy the most.

The second is a noble family that was subordinate to the Kingdom of Voistra, and is now a count, viscount, or baron in the Empire.

The third is the noble families that belonged to the former Voistra faction due to factional strife within the Empire.

Of these, only the second and third were actually ever invaded by my grandfather Galfis. He had never invaded the realm of the hated Imperial Duke, the avenger of his uncle.

He is now a nobleman of the empire, but he used to be powerful enough to call himself a king, and even now he has a high power of land. My grandfather was not so brainless as to make a move without a plan.

The Voistra Plain, which occupies about two-thirds of the Imperial Duke's territory, is one of the continent's leading granary areas, supported by fertile soil and abundant water sources.

The Imperial Duchy, which completely encompasses the Voistra Plains, has a large population of commoners.

If I were to create a city population ranking for the continent of Eruo based on my own prejudices, Ocellaria City would be at the top of the list. The top ten would be a sure thing, but the top five would be difficult.

In addition, there are many fields in the Imperial Duchy. In addition, there are a lot of fields in the Imperial Duchy, and sometimes you can get resources from the fields, such as rock salt from the fields in New Nellie City.

It is said that there are some delicious fields in the Imperial Duchy where you can get high quality stone and mineral resources.

In addition, the fields are spread out from the north to the south of the great river as if they were forts blocking the invasion of the Quardenze family, making them a natural strategic point.

Another characteristic of the Kingdom of Voistra is that the royal power is relatively strong, and other noble families are subordinate to the king, which is a bit unusual in the continent of Eruo.

The noble families that were vassals during the time of the Kingdom of Voistra are now counts, viscounts, and barons of the empire, and nominally the imperial nobles are now on equal footing with each other. However, the hierarchical relationship that existed at that time still remains.

If we were to attack the imperial duke's territory without thinking about it, we would be isolated in the enemy territory as the reinforcements from the former tributary territories would all arrive at once, and we would most likely be beaten back.

That's why my grandfather and father spent 20 years slowly hunting down the imperial duke.

The frontline base that my grandfather spent his time building was the long-awaited bridgehead for the invasion of the Imperial Duke's Voistra Plain.

Originally, it would have been another ten years before the frontline base was built.

It was a long-term plan to overthrow the Imperial Duke in my father's generation, or in my generation if that wasn't possible in time.

Since the plan was already in motion when I was born on the continent of Eruo, I feel like a Japanese who has had his house built on a three-generation mortgage.

The castle mentioned by the civil servants, Raishleaf Castle, is located in the northernmost part of the vast Voistra Plain, and is a castle with excellent defensive capabilities built on top of a small mountain.

From the point of view of the Quardenze family, it is the strongest shield protecting the Voistra Plains and, by extension, the city of Othello.

There are many wide roads in the area where Raishleaf Castle is located, and it is also a key point of transportation that connects to various places, so if the Quardenze army were to take control of the castle, the nobles of the old Voistra would always feel like they had a spoon to their throats.

More than fifty years ago, the then Emperor Zinkhaen, who had unified the western part of the continent during the turbulent times of the warring armies, had led a large army to attack the Kingdom of Voistra.

At that time, he attacked from the area currently controlled by the Quardenze family all the way down to the south, but there is an anecdote that the castle of Raishleaf just barely escaped falling.

Even Emperor Zinkhaen could not defeat the impregnable Raishleaf Castle. Its name is famous even in the Kingdom of Levios.

In this battle, the Voistra royal family, who felt the power of the Zinkhaen emperor firsthand, quickly surrendered before the second invasion came, promised to dismantle the kingdom, and even gave up their daughter.

In fact, the current emperor of the Zinkhaen Empire, Emperor Ferold, is the son of the daughter who was offered to him.

Emperor Zinkhaen chose to take the daughter of the Voistra royal family, who was offered as a hostage, as his own son Arginis' wife, and to acquire the power of the Voistra Kingdom as it was.

A few years later, Emperor Zinkhaen announced the founding of his country to the entire continent.

Looking at the current emperor, who has lost his authority, it is clear that it was a mistake to take in the Kingdom of Voistra.

Emperor Zinkhaen, who has been called the poster child for turbulent times, the hero king, and the dragon of the West Sea, was probably not very good at domestic politics.

"We always have troops on the lookout at important points. When we confirm the invasion of the old Voistra, we can immediately send a fast horse to New Nelly City. Please rest assured."

I heard that there are a number of soldiers monitoring the area between Nambonan City and the frontline base, as well as in the vicinity of Raishleaf Castle.

If they were to move the army, word would get out in the neighborhood, and no matter how fast they hurried, it would take some time to gather the troops. It's unlikely that the guards will miss it.

The knight's army marches at a fairly high speed because of the magic power that boosts its strength, but there is a good amount of time between the time the army is raised and the time it leaves.

"...... No, even if you don't get confirmation of an invasion, the first thing you should do is send out an early horse at the first sign of disturbance. I don't care if it costs a little. This is the most important time of the year. There's no better time than now to be cautious. I will advise your father to do the same."

The armies led by knights march fast, but there is one army that moves even faster than that. That is the army led by the noble lord, the Patriarch.

With his overwhelming magical power, the founder can increase the speed of his army by strengthening his men with powerful magic.

If the old Voistra is truly in dire straits, it is conceivable that a nobleman could lead the army.

Ordinary nobles are generally defensive and will often go to war in their own territory, but they rarely come all the way to enemy territory.

However, considering the investigations of the civil servants and Rumon's advice, I was somewhat worried.

We need to respond quickly to the movements of the army led by the nobleman. The confirmation process is important, but if there are any disturbing movements, I want to get the first report anyway.

"Yes!　Well, we'll let the army know."

My grandfather and father started this war, so I hope they will be able to clean it up by the time my generation comes along.

I don't want to leave a burden on the next generation.

After finishing my work, I returned to the pervert house.

Lately, I've been staying at the pervert's house.

"Welcome back, Master."

When I entered Rave's room, I was greeted by a beautiful woman with a smile on her face.

She seemed to have finished bathing a long time ago, and although she was dressed in her nightgown, her body was not burning.

I took Rave's hand and sat down on the sofa while we exchanged pleasantries.

Normally, we would have kissed and mated, but today I had something to say first.

"I need to talk to Rave."

"Yes?"

As I touched Rave's body, I explained that I was going back to New Nellie City.

As the son of a nobleman, I have a lot to do during the holiday season.

I'm not taking Rave to New Nellie City.

The best way to hide her existence from Eve is to leave her in Nambonan City.

No matter how much you try to keep your mouth shut, there's no guarantee that two beautiful elves in the same city won't bring some kind of information to Eve's ears.

"Yeah, ......."

When I told her that I would be away, Rave's face turned pale. The color of her face changed and her expression darkened.

I squeezed her shaking hand tightly and kissed her on the cheek.

"I'm not abandoning you Rave."

"But, but ......"

"New Nellie City will be a different environment than here. It will be hard for Rave."

"...... Still, I prefer to be with my master."

It's so cute to see Rave looking down at me with a sigh.

I wondered if she was doing it on purpose when she casually pulled my arm and pressed it against her chest.

The softness of it made my cock twitch.

"I think it would be better for Rave to stay with the girls in the compound. It's a place full of ...... strangers, you know?"

"Ugh ......."

Rave blended in well with the circle of protected girls, and the servants were all women, except for Tesh.

It's a place where she feels safe.

"And besides, I'm really busy over New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. I don't know if I'll be able to see you at night. If I do, Rave will be alone."

Yeah, that's .......

"I care about Rave very much. I care about Rave a lot, and I don't want her to have a hard time. Trust me, ......."

I smiled at her and hugged her as tightly as I could.

Her breasts are squeezed and pressed against my chest. It was a very comfortable feeling.

Rave gulped a few times as she listened to my words. She may have been trying to argue, but in the end, she remained silent.

"Rave."

I put my hand around the back of Rave's head, squinted my eyes and brought my lips close to hers.

"Master, ......."

Our lips met, and our tongues extended to intertwine.

We exchanged saliva, feeling each other's breath, the softness and warmth of each other's lips. My balls were almost at the limit, desperately producing semen.

"I won't see you for a while. We won't see each other for a while. I'm going to plant my seed in Rave tonight."

In the end, I ejaculated inside Rave three times that night.

Today's results were one shot in Rave in the early morning, two in Anna in the afternoon, and three in Rave at night.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 145 - Day of Departure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After waking up and pouring a few shots into the Rave, I got dressed and ready to go.

Since I had done all the work yesterday, there was nothing to do today. I just had to wait for the carriage to be ready.

I took a quick bath in the morning and went out to the courtyard to cool down my burning body.

It was a clear morning in the middle of winter, and the crisp, cold air felt good on my body after the bath.

"Oh?"

I see a small shadow in front of me as I stroll.

If it's wandering around the courtyard of the perverted house, it's most likely the guardian girl. The servants have work to do, Kohari is in a sickbed, and Rave is napping with semen dripping from her pussy.

"Tico?"

"Oh my God!　Mr. Mayor?

When I called out to her, she put her hands on her face and let out a high-pitched scream.

I've just finished taking a bath, but I'm fully clothed. There was no way she was going to walk around with her cock exposed.

It was not the kind of scream you would expect from a gentleman wearing a trench coat over his bare skin in early spring, but a cheer.

"Oh, good morning, my dear!"

"Mmm, good morning."

A stiff and nervous Tico greeted me in the morning. Her face was bright red, and she looked as if she had been exposed to the cold winter air.

When she reacted so clearly, I could easily guess why she was blushing.

I'm not the most perceptive person when it comes to women's hearts, but I'm also not so insensitive as to wonder why Tico's face is red when I see her now.

I looked at her with a smile on my face and saw that she was holding a hairy creature in her arms.

"Is that a thick-haired rabbit?"

"Yep!"

In response to my question, Tico held out the thick-haired rabbit as if to offer it to me.

I was hoping it would be a good conversation starter, but I guess she felt like I was asking her to give it to me, so she extended her arm as if she was giving me a certificate.

The rabbit seemed to weigh quite a bit, and her arm was shaking in little increments.

The other day, another guardian girl nearby had followed her when she got nervous and fidgety, but now it was just me and Tico.

She seemed to be full of it.

"Hmm?　Wasn't this Kohari's rabbit?"

I took a closer look at the rabbit that was pointed at me, and saw that it looked very much like Kohari's thick-haired rabbit.

"No, it's not!"

She thought that he suspected that she was a rabbit thief, so she panicked and started to explain that she hadn't done anything.

Tico was asked by Kohari to take care of the rabbit because she felt sorry for it if it caught a cold.

I don't think there was a rabbit in the room yesterday when I went to visit Kohari.

"So, I took it for a walk in the garden."

Thick-haired rabbits move slowly, so if you let them loose in the garden, they won't escape unless you are a very dense person.

Tico put the rabbit on the ground. Then the rabbit began to squirm and eat the grass that grew in the yard as if nothing had happened.

"You want me to walk it in the cold?"

The rabbit's fur grows better when it's outside. Especially in winter.

Kohari's way of thinking was completely that of a farmer.

Kohari kept the rabbits not for shearing, but for petting. He doesn't need to grow them out.

Tico looked at me desperately and said, "I'm not a thief, trust me, trust me," which was very cute.

"Don't worry, I know that Tico and Kohli are good friends. There's no need to panic."

I smiled at her, and she put her hands on her face again and shook her shoulders.

I can't help but think evil thoughts when I see how much she likes me.

I wonder what would happen if I attacked her right here and now and shook my hips as hard as I could. It would give me a sense of pleasure similar to the aesthetics of breaking up a tower of cards.

After the act, I feel like getting an erection just by imagining Tico quietly trembling and crying while spilling white liquid from her crotch, saying, "......, why are you like this......, I believed you were a kind person......,"

Of course, I wouldn't do that to a girl who is so blinded by her illusions.

When she's ready to be a woman, I'm going to teach her how to be a woman, and I'm going to give her plenty of my semen.

Tico glanced at my face, and she was tidying her hair with a hand comb, as if she wanted to make it look as good as possible.

"There's nothing to be nervous about. You're right. ...... Let's talk over there. It's cold here, isn't it?"

"Huh?

I casually put my hand on her back and led her into the house.

I was amused to see Tico moving her head from side to side, as if she was wondering if anyone was around.

I brought Tico into the living room of my living space in the pervert house.

While she was looking curiously at the room prepared for the nobility, Odie prepared tea for the two of us.

"The tea is ready."

"Ha, ha, ......."

Tico drank the tea, shaking the cup, and then put it back in the saucer while looking at us.

Tico's head snaps up slightly as the sound of the ceramic resonates sharply in the room.

"...... I'll be able to tell you later, but let me tell you first."

I put my cup down and looked into Tico's eyes. I could see the nervousness in her wisteria eyes as she wondered what he was going to say.

"It seems that Tico's father and brother are still alive. Looks like they were taken prisoner."

"...... What?"

Tico's father and brother were lured by money to join the war against the city of Nambonan as temporary mercenaries.

However, their opponents were the Quardenze Confederacy, a group of neighboring nobles, and no matter how many commoners they gathered, there was no way they could win.

And so, when Tico's father and the others did not return to the village, they were considered dead.

"Now I'm working on building a castle ...... in the land west of Nambonan City."

A good number of the Nambonan mercenary legions that were kicked around as the first war dogs of the neighboring nobles were captured and taken prisoner in the hunt for the remnants.

In the absence of convenient heavy construction equipment, the number of people is the speed of construction on the Eruo continent. All of the captives became slaves of the Quardenze family as construction workers for the frontline base.

That's why Tico's father and Tico's brother are still frantically working on building the castle under the cold morning sky at this very moment.

"Oh, ......!　Oh, no. ......!　Did you check it out, Mr. Mayor?

Tico's eyes lit up at the unexpected news of his survival, but it wasn't me who did the research. It was Rumon.

Rumon's father is also a slave.

He had been a member of the council when Nambonan City decided to start a war with the Quardenze family.

It's still fresh in my mind that the members of the council were held responsible for the war, had their property confiscated, and were reduced to slavery.

This was a strangely lenient measure compared to the execution of the perverted merchant just a few days ago, but it was a painful measure to keep Nambonan City under good control.

Half of the members of the council are popular citizens, in short, people who have been trusted with their virtue and character to hold their positions.

Publicly executing them would cause the citizens to harbor an unfathomable fear of the Quardenze family and a resentment that could not be dissipated.

If the city was just ruled by knights like a normal city, there would be no problem, but if you want to enjoy the delicious taste of Nambonan City without losing its special characteristics, the sentiment of the citizens would become important.

In addition, even before the decision was made, the military had received many petitions from the citizens to save their lives.

I personally liked the fact that all the citizens were willing to atone for their sins, rather than placing the blame solely on the council members.

As a result of the discussion between my father and Viscount Galiana, it was decided that it would be best if I ruled Nambonan City, and at the same time, the plan to publicly execute the council members disappeared.

Thus, all the council members were able to live.

The merchant councilors, however, were effectively dead, as all their property was confiscated.

Incidentally, the enslaved members of the council were sold at a very high price. It was said that each of them could buy a bunch of Eve.

The humanitarian councilors were purchased jointly by the citizens through donations, and the merchant councilors were purchased by large merchants in the city who were interested in their connections and abilities.

Rumon's father remained unsold. I heard that he was a merchant with a bad reputation to begin with, so perhaps he didn't want to be treated like one of them by buying poorly.

Thus, Rumon's father was sent to the frontline base like the other slaves and worked hard to build a castle.

But here comes a turning point. It was officially decided that Kohari would be my concubine.

I'm not so devilish as to keep the father of my beloved concubine as a slave.

I may not be able to make it to Nambonan City, but I can at least set up a place for her to live in another city in the Quadrant.

With this explanation from Tesh, Rumon went to meet his father with great joy.

By the way, Rumon's father was a big merchant who specialized in the mining industry.

He had risen through the ranks from a peddler to a successful businessman in his own lifetime, and his abilities were well known.

His knowledge of civil engineering is on par with that of a professional, and he has a wealth of experience in leading a group of miners.

When Rumon went to the site of the castle, he saw his father working hard to organize the slaves.

The fact that there were few people who knew about his bad reputation as a merchant, and the fact that his father was strong in civil engineering, which was very important for the urgent need to build the castle, seems to have helped him to create a good position.

It seems that capable people can make a name for themselves wherever they go.

He had already been promised that he would be treated as a civil engineer in the military service of Quardenze after the construction of the castle was finished.

It is more rewarding to make a position in the Quardenze army than to be freed from slavery and live in a city with nothing. Even if I go back to being a merchant and make money, I don't know when the nobles will take it from me again. Besides, I've done that once before and I'm tired of it. This time, you can try to get ahead in the aristocracy,......, he said with a big smile, and Rumon backed off without saying a word.

He was a very selfish father, but when he told me about it, Rumon looked a little relieved. I guess there is a trust that can only be understood between a father and his son.

So, having traveled all this way, Rumon quickly ran out of things to do.

However, he thought it would be a waste to just leave, so he decided to ask around to see if his father and brother Tico were around.

He must have been worried about Kianes' words that his family had died because of Nambonan City.

So he searched, and found them quite easily. Rumon's father also had a say in the management of the slaves, so he kept a list of all the slaves who worked there.

He would be allowed to return to the village in the spring.

"Wow ......!　I'll have to tell your mother. ......!

Rumon's father was enslaved for a serious crime, but Tico's father and the others were not so serious. Therefore, it is at the owner's discretion whether to free them or not.

It costs a lot of money to keep a large number of slaves working, so one way of thinking is to free them when they are done.

Like Tico's father and the others, there were apparently a good number of farmers who had become slaves as a result of joining the war from neighboring villages. In the case of such people, it would be more beneficial to release them and let them work on the farm. The cost of maintaining the slaves would be reduced, and the tax revenue of the farming village would increase.

My grandfather has been beating the asses of the slaves, telling them that he would release them in the spring if they built the castle well.

However, I was surprised that he agreed to recruit mercenaries for Nambonan City ....... Are the peasants unaware of such a situation?　It was obvious that they would be fighting against the Quardenze family. ......

If they were recruiting mercenaries in Nambonan City at that point, the only people they could think of to fight would be the Quardenze family.

I'm not sure if the peasants even know who the lord is fighting.

"What?　But there are no nobles or knights in Nambonan City, so there's no way they would fight against the lord. ......"

"Mm. ......"

I see, Tico has a good point.

A city with only commoners would never stand up to the nobility, this is common knowledge on the continent of Eruo.

Even if Nambonan City could hire magicians, they would be mercenaries of the ancestors at best. That's not enough to defeat an army led by a nobleman.

In the first place, a squire wandering around in the wild has a different level of strength than a squire from a knightly family who has been raised in an environment with magic-related know-how. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.

"And everyone said that Nambonan City was overlooked. They said they were paying off the lord."

The reason why the Quardenze family left Nambonan City unattended was because they thought that it could be easily dropped if the need arose, that it had a good influence on the Quardenze territory due to the large amount of merchant traffic, and that if the old Voistra was lured away to loot it, they would counter-crash it.

The people who were receiving the money, as Tico had said, were nobles who were hostile to the Quardenze family.

As if she thought I was going to scold her, Tico went on to give other reasons.

Many of the reasons Tico gave were deductions based on common sense or speculation based on the recent situation.

I had underestimated her because she was a peasant, but she seemed to have a rough grasp of the trends in the war.

"...... Surprisingly, the peasants are also watching the situation."

I was curious if the peasants knew anything about the rivalry between the nobles, so I decided to ask them.

I was in a position to lead the peasants as soldiers, so I wanted to know what their values were.

"Do you know why the current war between the Quardenze families started?"

Tico's expression became apologetic, yet full of question marks.

"What?　Is there a reason?"

"Hmm?"

Maybe I asked the wrong question, but I couldn't make sense of Tico's reply.

I think a reason is necessary for a war to start, but I didn't expect her to ask that question back.

"Oh!　I understand. The weak lord can't protect the land, so the strong lord came?"

I'm sorry to say that I don't understand Tico, who smiles confidently as if this is the correct answer, but I don't understand at all.

What she's talking about is the result of the war, not the reason for starting it.

If we apply Tico's theory as it is, we don't need a reason to crush the weak!　Weakness is a mortal sin!　If we apply the Tico theory as it is, we will end up in a world where weakness is a great sin!

"This is the difference in thinking. ......"

For Eruo people, strength is the source of authority.

Even if the logic is violent and says that the weaker person is worse, if the person saying it is strong, they will probably be convinced.

Tico thought that it was natural for the strong nobles to kill the weak nobles.

"Isn't that right, ......?"

I opened my mouth to Tico, who looked troubled, appealing that I wasn't angry.

"The Quardenze ...... my uncle, I think, who was conspired to death by the old Voistra people ......."

"Your uncle?"

Tico looked surprised. The girl's expression changed from time to time, which was interesting to watch.

She didn't seem to think that the war had started because her relatives had been killed.

It would be unforgivable that my uncle had been killed, but I'm sure that was not the only reason why the war started.

If we look back at the course of events from the start of the war to today, it is clear that the Quardenze family has the intention to invade.

However, the Quardenze had been doused by them time and time again in the past. I understood my father's idea of destroying them if there was a chance to do so.

Historically, the Kingdom of Voistra had always had its sights set on the fertile land of Quardenze on the other side of the river, and whenever they had time, they would try to set up internal divisions or send in strange nobles to take control of the land.

Annoyingly, the Kingdom of Voistra had no intention of seriously attacking, but rather harassed them from a distance where counterattacks could not reach.

It was only lucky if they became unbearable and subjugated, so the Quardenze family was constantly harassed by the Tsk Tsk Tsk Tsk.

At the time, the Kingdom of Voistra was more powerful, so the Quardenze family could not invade back, and just continued to build up resentment in the house.

Nowadays, the land between the two great rivers, the interior of the country, is unified by the family of Quardenze, but until a long time ago, noble families supported by the Kingdom of Voistra occupied some of the land.

The Quardenze family, which had New Nelly City and other major cities, was by far the strongest, but it was a proxy war with the Voistra Kingdom, and they were unable to unify.

To make matters worse, the noble house was established by those who could not become the head of the Quardenze family, calling themselves a branch family. Of course, it was the Kingdom of Voistra that inspired them.

He was a foolish child who was born into the Quardenze family but was used by the irreconcilable enemy, but even so, his blood ties were very strong.

There is no doubt that there was a part of him that was hesitant to seriously kill each other.

Grandmother Kasia, who was still a younger girl than Fanny at the time, came up with a bold plan and ran away from Quardenze, probably thinking of something when she saw the whole family fighting among themselves in the big river.

A few years later, after many twists and turns, Kasia returned to her hometown and took over from the indecisive head of the family, and mercilessly destroyed the four branch families that were under the control of the Voistra Kingdom.

Thus, the land was united by Grandmother Kasia, and the people of the land praised the princess of the direct lineage of the Quardenze family for bringing peace, and left her behind in songs and plays.

Her alias, "Princess of the Five Realms," was derived from the fact that she unified the five realms, including the Quardenze family and four self-proclaimed branch families.

And just like that, the old Voistra is a sworn enemy that the Quardenze family can never get along with, even without the matter of their uncle.

It would be safer to destroy them while the Quardenze family is still strong, and it would be easier for me, who will probably succeed them, to do so.

In addition, after the death of my grandmother, Kasia, my father had to scramble for domestic politics and diplomacy, and he had no outstanding military prowess.

Strength is important in this continent of Eruo. In diplomacy, the more widespread your military name is, the more cards you can play.

My grandfather Galfis, for example, is known not only in the Kingdom of Levios and the Zinkhaen Empire, but also in the Holy City of St. Navenpos.

The mere mention of such a celebrity would cause soldiers to flee and mercenaries to be hard to come by. In localized battles, it is even possible to win without fighting.

That's how great the influence of military prowess is, and it is a good check on the nobles who don't like to fight much.

However, my grandfather was already in his eighties, and although people with magical powers often live to be about a hundred years old, there was no telling what would happen to him in the future.

If my grandfather were to die, my father would be left with an increasing number of difficult situations.

As the head of the Quardenze family, it was only natural that he would want to weaken the old Voistra while his grandfather was still alive.

I believe that the real reason for turning on the old Voistra is more of a family problem than an uncle problem.

My grandfather is the only one I can think of who has a 100% vendetta against my uncle for conspiring to kill him.

I looked into Tico's eyes and opened my mouth.

"...... Ah, the people the Quardenze are fighting right now are the bad guys who killed our precious families and don't care."

"No way. ......!"

But I don't feel like explaining every single detail of such a troublesome situation.

For now, let's just say that the old Voistra was a bad guy.

I let Tico soak up the historical view that was biased toward the Quardenze family.

And I'm going to stop talking about the hard stuff and start talking about the fun stuff.

Wasn't it sad that I had to continue talking politics with such a pretty girl?

"...... War talk is no fun. Okay, let me tell you a story about Tico. You went to see the city the other day, didn't you?"

"What?

When I turned the subject to Tico again, she became nervous.

Apparently, she has a habit of stroking her hair when she gets nervous. Her purple hair moves in a breeze.

Her hair color was bright and shiny, and she even looked young.

"It looks like you went out with your brother. Did you find anything interesting?"

It seems that Tico and Kianes have settled down in their relationship. They have closed their mouths about the past that they both want to forget, and have returned to the good relationship they had before.

They were a little awkward at first, but now they're talking normally.

I'm relieved that they don't know about my bad deed of secretly fucking them.

Looking at Tico as she fumbled through her stories of the city, I prayed that the day would come soon when I could hold her again.

Tesh came into the room to tell us that the carriage was ready, and Tico had just finished her second cup of tea.

The thought of another few days in the carriage was depressing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 146 - Returning at Midnight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We arrived in New Nellie City after the sun had set and the surrounding area was covered in deep darkness.

We had asked Tesh to speed up the carriage, so we were back earlier than planned.

The plan was to stay another night on the way and arrive tomorrow around noon.

It seemed that the announcement had already been made at New Nellie Castle, and all the servants were there to welcome us.

It seemed that we were going to have to work overtime today. Incidentally, when this kind of overtime work occurs, dinner is served to the servants, but no overtime pay is given. It is service overtime.

Feeling a little bad for the servants standing in line, I got off the carriage and entered the castle.

A long journey is tiring.

"Thank you for your hard work.

Unlike in my previous life in Japan, there were only a few things I could do while traveling: read the books I had accumulated due to lack of time, look out the window of the carriage, or write.

And that was supposed to include having sex with Odie to make babies.

"I don't see Minith."

There was a line of servants in the hallway to greet me, but I looked around and didn't see Minith among them.

Odie, who was walking diagonally behind me, said, "Minith is showing signs of pregnancy."

"I've heard that Minith has been given leave of absence by the head maid, as she is showing signs of pregnancy. She is currently resting at her villa. Please rest assured."

According to Odie, Minith still hasn't received the moon thing that would have come around the beginning of last month.

If you made a ranking based on the number of times my semen has been poured into her, Anna would be number one overall, but if you made a ranking for New Nellie City only, Minith would be number one. It's no wonder she's pregnant.

"I see. ......"

"I'm sorry, but we'll have to postpone your visit until tomorrow."

The Master is waiting for you.

I was tempted to go and see what was going on, but unfortunately it was already nighttime.

If I were to go to the villa now, I would have to make preparations and the servants would have to work overtime. It would be better to give up.

"No, I know. Let's do it tomorrow. ...... So, where is father?

If he was waiting for me to come home, I'd like to go see him as soon as possible.

But Tesh moved to deny it.

"Why don't you take a bath first, sir? The Master has given you time to soak away the fatigue of your long journey."

According to Tesh, my father has been busy with his work for the end of the year and has been at his desk until midnight.

It was already time for Fanny to go to sleep, but for my father, it seemed that his work was just beginning. He said he had no problem taking a leisurely bath.

"Thank you for that. I've always wanted to take a bath.

Everyone in the castle knows that I like to bathe.

I hadn't been able to soak in the hot water on the carriage ride, only being wiped down with a wet cloth, which didn't make me feel any better.

But that wasn't the only reason why I didn't feel refreshed.

I hadn't ejaculated since my departure from Nambonan until today. I'm practically masturbating myself to death.

So I'm going to get ready to go.

Odie, who had been listening to me and Tesh, bowed and walked away from me.

As I stared at the back of her, specifically her ass, I felt my brain turn pink and my whole body start to feel horny. I feel quite pent up.

During the trip, Tesh was constantly holding the reins, so it was just me and Odie in the carriage.

When a man and a woman are alone in a locked room, there is only one thing to do. But I didn't. I couldn't do it.

"Tesh, tell someone not to push Odie too hard."

"Yes, sir."

Right after we left Nambonan City, I tried to hold Odie.

Odie was not willing to have sex with me unless I had the excuse that there was no other woman who could take care of the little boy ....... Therefore, traveling around the city was a great opportunity to have sex with Odie.

However, Odie refused to be embraced by me, saying that she was a little behind on her period.

Perhaps because of her serious nature, her cycle seems to be relatively stable, and she doesn't miss much on a regular basis.

I'm only a few days late, but I want to rest for now. I couldn't say "just let me do it" to Odie, who was patting her belly with a gentle smile as she said this.

I was surprised to find out that we might have already had a baby, even though we had only been together for a few months. The theory that Odie's husband is sterile is becoming more and more true.

However, if it was true that she was pregnant, he would be able to hold Odie without worrying about anything after the birth.

Odie was concerned that she would be wasting precious semen if he poured it on an infertile woman like her, so if it turned out not to be wasted, he could pour it all he wanted.

I was happy to be able to hold Odie, Odie was happy to have a child, and her husband was happy to be able to raise a child with the blood of the main family, a win-win-win happy ending.

"Phew. ......"

I regretted a bit that I should have instructed him to call Eve to New Nellie Castle.

It was troubling to have the perfect person in the villa to help me get rid of this horny feeling.

It would be hard to call Minith or Lupetta now, and Eve was the only option.

And I think it's a good idea to hold Eve while she remembers the comfort of Rave's embrace.

"Tesh, ......."

I was just about to say, "Call Eve," when I stopped speaking.

"Brother?"

I saw Fanny around the corner in the hallway.

She seemed to have already finished bathing and was wearing a pretty nightgown that looked like several layers of lace curtains.

Her long blue hair was slightly wet, giving her a certain sexiness.

"Big brother, big brother."

As soon as she saw me, Fanny walked up to me, speeding up her steps so as not to lose her elegance.

The smile that overflows with joy is really cute, and I wanted to spray semen on it with a cross counter.

"Oh brother, I've missed you so much, brother. ......"

Fanny hugged me with all her might and buried her face in my chest. The feeling of a woman's body through her clothes made my cock harden.

I try my best to keep my head on straight so that the clinging Fanny doesn't notice my erect cock.

There was a story in a previous life that I could suppress my erection by thinking of my mother's face, but I rejected that idea, as the thought of my mother, Meryl, in the continent of Eruo, made my erection more intense.

I had no choice but to calm my penis by thinking of Viscount Galliano's face.

"Brother ......, it's good to see you ......."

"What's the matter, are you being a spoiled brat today?"

Even though I hadn't seen her in a long time because of my business trip to Nambonan City, I was still surprised by this big welcome.

She hugged me tightly, and I could feel her pampering like never before.

"As soon as you defeated the demonic beast, you disappeared. ...... I was very worried. ...... I was afraid that my brother had actually passed away. ...... Oh, I am so glad that my brother is back. ...... My brother. ......

As if to confirm my existence, Fanny presses her head against me. The hardness of her head is very comfortable.

Last time, after I defeated the mature demon beast, I left for Nambonan City without returning to New Nelly Castle.

This was to prevent the outbreak and spread of strange diseases caused by demonic beasts, but Fanny had a strange intuition.

Every letter that arrived in Nambonan City was always mixed with one from Fanny, and it always started with "Are you sick?"

No matter how many times I wrote back, "I'm fine," the beginning never changed. I was both amused and pleased by her concern.

I wrote to her again and again, "How are you? See, I hope you are well."

Now my crotch was full of energy.

Fanny is rapidly changing into a woman's body these days, and I'm worried about my lower half if she continues to spoil me like this.

I have no intention of stopping her, though, because I am more than happy to be spoiled by my cute little sister.

"Have I ever lied to Fanny?"

"No, you haven't."

Then Fanny turned her mother's clear blue eyes toward me and smiled.

"You said it yourself. He said he would protect me even if a demonic beast came. ......"

I think we talked about this before, that even if a magical beast comes, I will protect Fanny!

It's not that I fought with the intention of protecting only Fanny, but it seems to be the case in her mind, so I'll let it pass. I'm a great brother who keeps his promises.

I stroked her hair and cheek without replying, and Fanny silently leaned in close to me, so I lightly held her shoulders.

I focused all my attention on my fingertips and savored her body as much as I could.

"Fanny, I'm home."

"Yes, brother. Welcome back."

While I inwardly writhed as Fanny smiled with satisfaction, I realized that I was home.

My home is the best, after all. In a sisterly sense.

Apparently, Fanny had stayed up late just to say welcome home to me.

She seemed to be satisfied with this short conversation and closed her eyelids and leaned against me, saying something incomprehensible.

She closed her eyelids and leaned against me, saying something incomprehensible. She must be sleepy since it was the time when she would normally be sleeping.

Led by the servants around her, Fanny returned to her room.

"Young master. It's about your bathing servant. ......"

As I started to walk to my room to take a bath before Fanny disappeared, Tesh opened his mouth.

"I remember you mentioning something like that. Are preparations underway?"

The old lady who had been in charge of the baths since she was a child had already retired because her temporary replacement had been decided.

The old lady, who had been in charge of the baths since she was a child, had already retired because a temporary replacement had been appointed, but since this was only a temporary assignment, the official person in charge of the baths was still undecided.

In the past, I had instructed Tesh to gather people who wanted to be in charge of the bath.

"Yes. I've sent out a notice to gather them when we return. We can gather those who want to be in charge of the baths now."

"Since we'll decide later anyway, let's do it today."

I'll go to my room and prepare for bathing.

I'm sure they'll be ready for anyone who wants to take a bath while I get ready in my room.

As I've heard before, there were a lot of people who raised their hands to be in charge of the bath this time.

And most of them were senior servants, that is, daughters of the knightly families.

Senior servants live and work in New Nellie's castle, so it's easy to gather them even in the middle of the night if you want to.

The knights of the Quadrant know that I have been hugging women without restraint ever since the arrival of Eve.

I'm sure they're trying to get as close as possible to me so they can get some of my seed.

They must have thought that being in charge of the bath, where I would be naked, would be a good position. They were right.

I went back to my room and got ready to take a bath before heading for the bathroom.

When I entered the changing room, I found all the servant girls lined up in a row. Those who were men were already excluded.

There was also a line of female servants in their late twenties, who seemed to have been informed that I was a man who would eat an older woman without hesitation.

Looking at the age range, the younger ones were around Fanny, the older ones around Mimon, and the largest group was around Minith.

These are the ones who raised their hands to help the little boy take a bath.

"Hmm."

The sight of fifty or so girls gathered in the changing room was quite bizarre.

I moved my gaze to see who I should choose, but all the girls were so beautiful that the knightly family had taken the trouble to send them to me.

I would rather have them all.

"Mm, you three."

"Yes!"

The first thing that caught my eye was a group of three girls in the back.

The three girls were wearing only a thin robe, similar to a loincloth, that looked like it could get wet.

In the midst of the crowd of uniformed servants, the sight of them standing upright in their transparent robes was quite eye-catching.

"You seem to be very motivated."

"Yes!　Yes, I've been trained at my parents' home to help the young master bathe."

The girl standing in the middle seemed to be the leader of the group and answered my questions on behalf of the three of us.

She spoke brightly and crisply, and seemed to be full of confidence. It seemed that she had been practicing a lot.

"Hmm. ......"

Looking at the three of them in their underwear, you can clearly see the difference in their body shapes.

The leader of the group is a girl with a bright smile and well-fleshed breasts and buttocks, a slender, tall girl with beautiful legs, and a girl who is short and poorly built, but whose face is the best of the three.

It might be a strategy to attract my attention by dressing differently from the others, and to get me to pick up one of the three girls by showing them their different types.

If you compare their faces, you can see that they look somewhat alike, so it is possible that they are sisters. For the knightly family, it would be a great victory if just one of them became a concubine, so they would at least devise a plan.

In any case, as a man, I have no choice but to pick them all up.

"I'll ask the three of you."

As I said this, an inexplicable buzzing sound echoed through the changing room.

The girls of the knight's family were like, "I've been beaten!"

"Yes!　Please leave it to me!

The three girls with their big smiles and postures of gratitude looked like high school students who had just passed college.

But I'm going to pick them all up.

"I'm putting you in charge of the bathing today."

I emphasized the word "today" in my statement.

I've only had a quick look, but it looks like I'll enjoy it no matter which girl I assign to be in charge.

If that's the case, the bathing staff should be rotated rather than fixed.

"Today's ....... Thank you very much!　I'll make every effort to satisfy you, young master!"

The undershirt girl, who thought it was a done deal, showed a hint of disappointment for a moment, but quickly regained her composure.

She must have reconsidered her decision to work hard and win the assignment.

The girls around her seemed to feel that they still had a chance, and they were looking at the three girls in underwear with a glare.

"Puran, Deri, and Sharo will stay, and the rest of you disperse."

Tesh said, and the other girls bowed together and quickly left the changing room.

The three undershirt girls looked at me, rubbing their arms, perhaps remembering the winter chill from the reduced number of people.

The collarbone glimpsed through the gaps in her robe and the neck exposed by her hair were really nice.

My crotch was already hardening.

It was going to be difficult to get her to take off her clothes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 147 - Eating the girls trained to be my servant (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There seemed to be a great deal of tension in removing the clothes of their lord, the legitimate son of the Quardenze family.

The shivering fingertips of the undershirt girls were not due to the cold, but probably because they were in awe of me.

Since they are not my personal servants, they don't have many opportunities to get this close to me.

The girls surrounded me as if they were going to lynch me, and touched my clothes with fearful hands.

Perhaps it was because they were nervous, but their coordination was poor and their movements were wasteful.

The girls looked to be in their mid-teens or so. If I put them in dresses, they would look like high school girls.

The more I hurriedly tried to take off my clothes, the more their garments gradually became disheveled, revealing their young skin. It was a lucky break for me.

"Puran, Derry, was that Sharo ......?"

"Yes."

I've had my eye on some of the beauties in the castle before the sex ban was lifted, so I can recall their faces and names with a little brainstorming.

And since Tesh had called them by name earlier, there was no doubt.

"Are the three of them family?　The fact that they are all dressed alike suggests that they have prepared for each other."

"It is as you say, young master. We grew up together under the roof of the Toghrunom family.

It seems that they are not sisters.

Some knightly families gather children from the side families into the main family and raise them, so just because they grew up in the same family doesn't mean they are sisters.

If they were direct descendants, they would visit to greet the new year, but I didn't remember their presence. Perhaps Puran and her sisters were born into a side line of the knightly Toghrunom family.

Perhaps because they were beautiful, they were secured by the main family as members of the New Nellie Castle ascendants.

"I see. So they are like sisters then."

Three beautiful sisters. Three beautiful sisters is a fascinating word that makes my heart dance.

"Yes."

As they undressed me, I continued my conversation.

I was ready to take them. Since I was going to hold them in my arms, I wanted to know their backgrounds to some extent before I started enjoying them.

In addition to the breasts glimpsed through the raised robe, the fine skin of the young girls, the slightly raised collarbone, and the neck exposed by the hair that had been pulled up to keep it dry were all very intriguing.

"I'll take it off."

"Oh."

My jacket was removed, leaving me with nothing but a light cloth on my upper body.

Puran's hands reached for my pants, the main part of my body. But it would not be easy to pull them down.

"Oh, ......."

"Puran?　I took your belt off."

"Don't keep the young master waiting."

Deri and Sharo make small calls from the side, but Puran remains frozen.

Puran tried to undress me from the front, but my meat stick is so erect that I can't get it down.

She loosened her pants with a fine hand that conveyed her concern that something might go wrong if she took them down roughly.

"Please excuse me. ......"

"Mmm."

With a hand on my erect penis, which was caught in my pants, Plan gently and protectively undid my pants.

It's hard not to get excited when a young girl touches your dick, even if it's through your underwear. My penis grew even harder.

"I'll take down my underwear too."

"Oh."

I didn't have to say no to her, I could just take it off, but Puran confirmed it with a serious expression and a nervous voice.

It seemed to be a declaration of her own determination.

She took a sigh of relief and pulled down his underwear.　And then, with a mighty thrust, the meat stick flew out.

The tip of the stick, exposed and erect in a straight line, was getting wetter by the second.

The effect of the masturbation ban was incredible, and my penis dripped endlessly with juices as it tried to find a place to fit. It was like a lost child shedding tears.

"......!"

The three girls didn't say a word, but their eyes widened and they gasped when they saw the battle-ready penises.

"What's the matter, you're not going to take a bath?"

I called out to the three of them, who were still in a daze.

"Oh, ......!　I'm sorry."

I tried to keep my cool, but I was a little nervous inside.

It is a little embarrassing to have young girls staring at your shamelessly wet penis as you seek to mate.

I feel like I'm another step closer to the spirit of the gentleman in the trench coat that shows up in early spring.

Perhaps it was because it was cold outside, but the bathroom was filled with white steam.

"Young Master. Please come this way.

I was led by the voice of Puran, and when I approached, I found something strange prepared there.

There were three tatami mats of cloth stacked on top of each other, making it look like a futon laid out in a bathroom.

On top of the cloth, there was a small chair without a backrest.

The three girls kneeled down on the cloth and put their fingers on it.

"We will now purify the young master's body. Here is the plan."

"Deri."

"Sharo."

Every time I think about it, I have trouble seeing her breasts when she poses on her knees in loose clothing.

It's a pose that I can only think of as an invitation.

"I'll leave it to you."

I replied with dignity, not even trying to hide my erect penis.

"Then please sit here."

A hand pointed to a small chair, and I sat down.

After a few refusals, a tub of hot water was poured over me.

The cloth on the floor was soaking wet, but the girls didn't seem to mind.

As I was surrounded by the three girls, my arms and back were washed, and my hair was washed as well.

I had invited three of them into the bath because of my lust, and it was quite pleasant to be washed by a sea of people all at once, even more so when it was done by girls of high school age.

"Excuse me. ......"

Puran positioned himself in front of me and gently placed his hand on my erect cock. My penis quivered with delight at the unexpected soft touch.

"......uh......"

After heaping a heap of soapy foam in her palm to create a soft cushion, Puran wrapped her hands around my glans.

Then, with a hand as if handling an expensive work of art, she begins to gently caress ...... rather, wash the glans.

"If you are uncomfortable, please let me know."

"Oh ...... ah."

There was no displeasure.

She said she had learned how to do it at her parents' house, but this must have been a lesson in how to handle a cock.

The way she tantalized me, the gentle stimulation of the bubbles, the way she used them to slide over me, all of these were techniques that would lead a man to pleasure.

"Ugh. ......"

The ring made by the fingers moves back and forth on the rod, bringing exquisite stimulation.

"Young Master. I'd like to borrow your hand.

Sharo, a Lolita girl positioned on the side, took my left hand.

When I glanced over at her, I saw that her entire body was drenched in water, and her peach-colored nipples were completely transparent. Her undershirt was also in disarray, exposing her white skin from her navel.

I felt that she was blatantly inviting me. The wetness and disarray of her undershirt was too unnatural.

"Please excuse me as well."

Deri, a tall beautiful woman standing behind me, put her arm around my balls.

I'm not sure if it's the stimulation of my balls, but I'm more concerned about the fact that she's so tightly attached to my back.

Not as big as Puran, but big enough for a grown woman, her breasts are squashed against my back, and I can't help but be aware of their presence.

It's not that I don't like it, but it's just that she's so tall that she's having a hard time adjusting the height of her breasts, and she keeps them pressed against her back as she moves up and down.

"Nn, nn...... nn...... ♡."

In addition to that, she breathes into my ear in a way that I can't imagine her helping me with the bath.

Washing my balls seems like something that should be left to Puran who is washing my cock, but the way she washes them in such a stimulating way, it's a different kind of bath altogether.

"You've been practicing a lot...fuck... its very good- -"

The three of them opened their mouths happily when I said that.

"Yes!　Thank you very much."

"It was worth the practice."

"We are honored to receive your compliments."

It was not an act, but a voice that sounded as if it was truly happy.

But there was one thing that bothered me. I wondered how she could have practiced such a special bathing technique, let alone a normal one.

My mother and sisters wouldn't be able to do it.

"They must have had a lot of practice.　How did you learn about the male body?"

Instead of Puran, who was engrossed in washing his cock, or Deri, who was behind me, I turned to Sharo, who had moved from palm to arm washing, and asked.

"I practiced with my brothers in the bathroom at my parents' house."

Sharo replied with a clean, smiling face.

There was no sense of self-consciousness or immorality in her answer. I even felt a sense of pride that I had done it.

"Ho......"

According to Sharo, she had practiced these techniques with the men in her family, as well as with Puran and Deri.

I envy her. I wish I had an older sister or younger sister who could do that for me.

Being used as a training ground for dick skills by beautiful sisters like Puran, Deri, and Sharo was too good to be true.

As I was thinking about this, Deri opened her mouth as if taking over Sharo's words.

But we haven't really gotten to know men yet. We are maidens who only know the skills on the surface.

I take back what I said before. I don't want naughty sisters who do a lot of erotic things for me but don't let me do the real thing.

"I wish I had the chance to learn somewhere else. ......"

Deri's line was very glossy and tinted with an invitation to us.

If you don't take advantage of this, you are not a man. Good thing I haven't had sex in a while.

"Hmm. You seem to be eager to learn."

"Yes, we three have the same desire."

It's good to be motivated. I'll make sure to teach her how to taste cock.

I can't help but smile deeper.

"I like it. We'll have to take a longer bath."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 148 - Eating the girls trained to be my servant (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I took a longer bath.

The three girls, who had read my intention to have sex here, immediately moved in front of me and kneeled on the floor.

They were all dressed in wet and disheveled undergarments that seemed to invite me in, and that made my libido soar.

"I will serve you, ......, young master. Please pick one."

"Yes?"

All three of them were staring at me with eyes that said, "Choose me."

It feels good to have girls of my age looking at me with such ardor.

But I'm not going to enjoy just one of them. I'm going to have them all in one set.

"There's no need to pick one. Let's enjoy them all."

The girls froze for a moment, as they hadn't thought of three at once, but they immediately looked at each other and went into action.

"...... So, let's start here."

The three girls smiled bewitchingly and put their index fingers to their lips. I swallowed my spit in silence at the beautiful pose.

They may be implying that they are going to give you a blow job, but their sexy movements are so natural that the gap between them and the younger girls' figures is irresistible.

"I'll leave it to you guys first."

As soon as I said that, the three of them approached me as if they were in agreement.

Puran is in front of me, Deri on my right knee, and Sharo on my left knee.

Then Puran silently signaled with her hand, and Deri and Sharo made me open my legs wide.

The three of them stepped between my open legs and brought their faces close to my meat stick.

My penis, being stared at by these women, was already erect to the breaking point. The girls were staring at his penis, which was already near the limit of its erection, and the slightest touch would have caused it to curl.

"It's ...... so tough and nice."

"Really ......"

The first person I reached out to was Sharo.

Her body of the Lolita type, and her face was very well-rounded and beautiful.

She grabbed my sack and rubbed her cheek against my rod.

"...... chu."

I kissed her lightly on the underside, and she looked up at me as if to check my reaction.

I nodded silently for her to continue.

"...... hamu♡"

Opening her small mouth wide, Sharo took the still half-peeled meat stick into her mouth.

I could feel the movement of her tongue sliding between the glans and the skin from his penis, which was completely eaten and out of sight.

In the next moment, the temperature of Shallow's mouth was suddenly transmitted through the mucous membrane. His cock skin must have peeled off, exposing his glans.

I thought she was going to suck me off, but she kissed the tip of the glans and parted her lips.

The meat stick that had been released trembled shamelessly as it searched for a place to fit.

I'm not sure if it's Sharo's saliva or her juices, but a clear liquid drips from the completely stripped glans.

"Let's see who can do it best, young master.

When Puran says this, she sticks out his tongue as if she's doing an Akanbe and adds it to my backside.

Then Deri and Sharo followed suit, extending their red tongues and pressing them between the sides of the glans.

"Ooh ......!"

The three beautiful girls huddled around my penis.

I could see that they were stretching their tongues to the limit so that I could easily see their movements.

The one in front of me was looking up, while the two on either side, Deri and Sharo, were staring at me in profile.

Their licking movements were well coordinated, but sometimes their tongues would intertwine with each other.

The scent of lilies was not lost on them, and their penises responded by increasing in hardness. What they need is the scent of chestnut blossoms.

"Chubu...... chu♡ Chu...... reu...... chu."

"Chub chub chub, chub chub, haha...... ♡ chub ...... ♡ chub, chub chub."

"Mmm...... chu...... chu...... chup, chup, rello......♡ mmm♡ chu, chu, chu."

My penis was being attacked by tongues from three different directions, and I was already on the verge of ejaculating.

Even with just one person sucking my cock, I felt like I was going to ejaculate immediately, but there was no way I was going to be able to compete with the three of them and their high level tongue skills.

"Fuck ......!"

But for me, if I'm going to do it, I think vaginal ejaculation is the best way.

It's not a bad idea to cum in her mouth, but if it's the first time you're holding her, you want to do it in her vagina first.

I thought about who to hold first, and I focused on Puran in front of me. It was easy to get a good picture of her body because she was right in front of me, and the way her body swayed and her breasts puffed with each lick was very moving to me.

"Puran."

I called out her name and decided to tell her my request in silence.

I want to do it, I want to do it, I want to do it. I send my gaze with these thoughts.

"Chupa ...... hoo, hoo!"

And it seemed to have been transmitted to the plan like telepathy.

Deri and Sharo stopped caressing with their tongues and pulled faces at the sight.

"Wow, am I right?"

"Of course. Is this the right place?"

"Yes!"

She put her hand on his penis and pointed the tip to Puran, and then she lay down on her back on the spot.

The floor was covered with cloth, so there was no particular problem in having sex here. Perhaps because there were quite a few layers of cloth, it still felt thick enough to absorb water.

This way, Puran would not feel any pain even if he was thrusting hard in the normal position.

"Young Master, please come in."

In spite of the presence of Deri and Sharo, Puran opened her legs in an M-shape and also opened her labia with her fingers.

Deri and Sharo were about to step back, probably convinced that mating was about to begin.

"Wait. It's also fun to fuck in front of you guys. Take a good look."

I stopped them as they tried to leave, thinking that I would show them what I had done.

"Alright..."

They seemed a little confused, but Derry and Sharo replied and stood by.

When I returned my attention to Puran, I saw that she had a small jar of liquid smeared on her crotch.

"What's that?"

"It's a lubricating dew. It's not dangerous, so please don't worry."

I wondered if she had some kind of lotion or something, but she was very well prepared. I can't believe this is the behavior of a virgin.

I've been abstinent for a long time, and I'm grateful for the fact that I want to insert and ejaculate right now.

"I'm going in."

"Yes, yes, ...... ah ♡"

I put my penis at her vulva.

I thought about whether or not I should apply lubricating dew to my penis as well, but I guess I don't need it since it's slick with the saliva of the three of us.

I immediately began to insert myself.

"...... agh!"

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, I am. It's just a little bit painful. It's okay, don't worry about it."

When I looked at the joint area, I thought I saw just a little bit of fresh blood.

I didn't think for a second that she was lying, but I was a little surprised that she really was a virgin.

A slutty virgin.

"Don't push yourself. Let's get you used to it.

"Mmm......"

I leaned over Puran's body in the normal position and put my weight on her. My genitals were slowly penetrating the place where nothing had ever been inserted in her entire life.

I felt sorry for Puran, who was confused by the pain she hadn't experienced before, but I was feeling a melting pleasure in my woman's body for the first time in days.

"Oh ...... that's good ......."

There is nothing that can compare to the feeling of penetrating the flesh in every possible way.

I felt the urge to squirt my semen all over her and make her my color right now.

Her vagina, which had been a virgin just a few seconds before, was very narrow and hot, as if I could feel the blood flowing through her body.

''Puran .......''

"Oh ......♡ Mmm, chu."

Just by stretching her neck and calling out her name, Puran immediately understands our intentions.

They twisted their outstretched tongues together out of their mouths as if to show Deri and Sharo who were observing beside them.

Perhaps not used to kissing, Puran's tongue was a bit awkward. However, as we kissed for a while, swinging our hips, her tongue movements became smoother.

Maybe it was the application of her blowjob skills. It's amazing to see a girl with good basic skills.

 "Haa...... young master......"

"Chuu...... haha, haha...... Puran, good ...... good."

She parted her lips and let a streak of saliva drip down.

In the meantime, I continued to swivel my hips and enjoy her vaginal walls.

"Phew, phew. Huh, huh, huh. ......!　Fuck!"

I continued my pistoning motion as I rubbed them together, skin to skin.

Her breasts were soft, squashed by my body, and I occasionally rubbed them with my fingertips.

I began to prepare to release my first shot.

From the normal position, I took both of Puran's legs in my hands and lifted them up and pushed them down towards her head. It was a gyrating motion.

He then put his weight on her exposed buttocks and plunged his penis all the way in.

"Aghhh ......!"

"Phew, phew!　I'm cumming. ......!　Puran!　Puran!

Bububuh, bugglu, bugglu!

Because of my position on top of her, my penis is facing straight down.

The momentum of my ejaculation and gravity sucked every drop of my semen into Puran's vagina.

I could feel and understand that my seed was reaching deep into her body. And that understanding brought the most exquisite pleasure to my brain.

"Goo...... goo!　Take it ......!"

"Oh, ...... ♡ Is that ......?　Young master's seed  ...... ♡, everyone I- ......."

The legs of Puran are wrapped around my waist. She was in a holding position, trying to suck out every drop of his seed.

"Huh, huh.　There's plenty of my seed in you...."

I whispered as I squeezed my palms together and intertwined my fingers.

The small ejaculation was still going on, and my body was shaking as if it had gone into convulsions.

"Yes ......, I understand ....... I feel the young master's ......"

Puran hugged my trembling body and stroked my back as if she were nursing a baby.

I didn't fight it, but sank down to be pampered by her chest. Her breasts are soft.

"This is ...... young master's ...... amazing ......!"

"Sharo, shhhh, ......!"

Now that the intense pistoning was over, I could afford to listen to what was going on around me.

I eavesdropped on the conversation between Deri and Sharo as I poured the remaining sperm into Puran.

The two of them seemed to be slightly excited to see the live sex taking place in front of them.

I held my breath as I maintained my union with Puran for a few moments.

"That was good, Puran."

We kissed each other, and I pulled out my penis.

The semen that I saw when I pulled it out was a light yellowish color rather than white, as if it had been stored for several days.

It had the consistency of starchy glue. It would have stuck to the inside of Plan's vagina.

"Oh, thank you so much, ......♡"

I look at my deflated penis, covered in semen.

It has turned into a child's cock, and a cute one at that.

"I'll clean you up."

It was Sharo who came up to me and said that.

I glanced over and saw that Puran was limp from the shock of her first mating, lying on her back with her M-shaped legs spread and being cared for by Deri.

Sharo took the penis in her small mouth and put it in her mouth as if she was tasting it.

I was a little embarrassed thats he was tasting my penis.

Sharo sucks on it, making a gurgling sound as if she is doing it on purpose. Her expression is a smile.

"Jubuubu...... juru...... juru...... fumo?　Hmpf, young master, are you well already ......?"

A few days of abstinence, Sharo's careful clean-up blowjob, Puran lying down with semen dripping from her crotch, and Deri with her pubic area in full view as she cared for Puran in a crawling pose.

The combination of these factors caused my penis to restart at a frightening rate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 149 - Eating the girls trained to be my servant (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the second round, and I would like to have either Deri or Sharo.

There's no way I'm not going to fuck when there's a beautiful, almost naked woman right in front of me.

The one closest to me at the moment was Sharo. I hugged her shoulders and the smell of cum hit my nose.

It was only natural, since Sharo had just sucked on a cum-covered penis.

Once he had ejaculated, his brain was no longer full of excitement, and he had developed a slight sense of reason.

I told Sharo to go rinse her mouth out and called Deri, who was cleaning up after Puran.

"Yes, young master, what can I do for you ......?"

I think she was going to say, "What can I do for you?" but he seemed to have guessed what it was when she saw my erect cock sticking out.

"I've been looking at Deri's ass for a while now. I wanted to stick it in."

"Yes, yes."

The invitation was no longer even remotely romantic, but Deri took no notice and agreed to copulate with me. Aristocrats are the best.

"Point your ass at me."

Deri turned her hips toward me in a crawling pose and spread her pubes with her hands.

The color of the fresh is just as bright here as it is on Puran.

Puran's "M" pose was pretty good, but it was nice to see her on all fours with her vulva spread.

It was as if she was asking me to mate with her.

"You're ready for ......?"

"Yes."

When he touched her pubic hair, which was slightly thinner than Puran, it felt wet.

Perhaps it is lubricated with a mysterious lubricant, just like Puran.

I thrust my penis into her without hesitation from the doggy style position.

"Nnggg!"

I felt like something was caught, but I kept going.

"Phew. ...... is in."

"Mhm. ......"

My penis was buried in Deri's tight, shapely ass.

"Ohhhh... ......"

The way she moaned and groaned at the foreign sensation of a dick being inserted for the first time was very cute.

Her vagina seemed to be in a panic at the sudden appearance of the meat stick, and contracted violently.

I didn't move, just enjoyed the confusion.

She had a beautifully curved neck, lean thighs, and a well-defined ass.

Her tits were only average, but her tall, smart figure was a good hug.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, ......, I'm fine. You can do as you please, young master."

In the end, she was able to do her job, even though she was suffering from the thrusting rod.

The wriggling in her vagina seems to have calmed down a bit, so it's time to start moving his hips.

"Good luck with Deri ......!"

Puran, who had somehow recovered, cheered in front of Deri, who was now on all fours.

"Yeah, are you okay, ugh?"

I started pistoning along with Puran's words. I didn't wait for Deri's reaction, but kept on pumping my hips.

Puran's vagina was hot and narrow, but Deri's felt more like a tight vagina than a narrow one.

"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"

"Nice, Deri."

I secured her neck firmly with my hands and slammed my hips down as hard as I could.

"Ohh."

It felt good to plunge my penis deep into her, but the elasticity of her ass felt good too.

I shake my hips even more, wanting to taste her ass.

I pressed my body against hers as if to embody the word "pounding"

"Hmmm, hmmm... ......Young Master, ......mmm... ...... Ahh... ......"

Since I had already ejaculated once, the second one would take a little more time.

Deri's voice becomes a little more indulgent as she is subjected to the intense caressing of her buttocks.

He continues the pistoning motion, teasing her when she catches her breath, and then doing it again.

"Ugh ...... ugh ...... ♡ ugh ...... ♡"

And in proportion to her moaning, her vagina also becomes hot and begins to get ready to accept his seed.

As if guided by the heat, my body also got into the position for ejaculation.

"Huh, ......, ......!　Huh. ......!　Oh, my God, I can't ...... it out. ......!　Take it, ...... Deri, ......!"

"Ugh, ha, ha!　I'll take it!"

Shuuluru!　Fuchūfuchū!

I pulled her hips as hard as I could and shot my semen into her vagina.

"Ggh!　Gghh!　And, Delly!"

"Oh ♡ ......!　Oh!"

This was the second ejaculation, but it was no less powerful. I could see the seed spewing out of her as it hit the very back of her.

If you can see through her hips, you can get a bird's-eye view of her shooting into her vagina, and it will make you feel great. It's a great way to get a feel for what it's like to be a woman. ...... Just imagining it made my semen shoot out even more.

"U...... ah, wow, it's coming out...... I can feel young master's...... ♡...... ah......."

"Good. ...... Take it. It's all yours, Deri."

After a while, Deri, who had been on all fours receiving my ejaculation, lost her strength and fell down on her face.

"Phew. ......"

I pulled my penis out and felt a sense of satisfaction as I watched Deri's crotch flood with semen.

The sight of Deri on her face, catching her breath after the act, was indecent. Well, I can't help it, I've done something indecent.

I was a little tired and was about to lie down, when Puran came over to me and sat upright.

"Young master, if you don't mind, come here."

"Mmm. Thank you.

I put the back of my head on Puran's lap, which acted as a lap pillow.

I could smell some semen from Puran's crotch, but I was more interested in the tits in front of me.

"There's something here that looks good."

If I was curious, I had to reach for it.

I reached out a little and touched those twin hills, and Puran made a sweet sound.

"Ahh ♡ ...... young master."

I enjoy Puran's reaction as I tweak her breasts with my fingertips.

The nipple rings of Puran's breasts were a bit large, and seemed to be worth sucking on.

"Puran."

I called out her name, and that was enough to make Puran bend down and pull her tits closer to me.

The nipple came within easy sucking distance of me. I reached out my tongue to lick the tip and took it into my mouth.

"Mmm ♡"

"Chupu...... chu......."

I taste Puran's breast while she's on her knees.

As I sucked on them, I could tell that Puran had slightly larger areolae.

"Haan......♡ Young Master......"

"Chuu......noooo...... chuuuup...... chup."

Puran bent down even further, so all I could see was her body.

My head was wrapped around her body, and the warmth of her body felt good.

"Chuu...... chuu............ hmm?"

As I was savoring the milk, my penis was suddenly enveloped in heat.

This feeling was a blowjob.

"It's Sharo." Puran said. I stopped sucking and she must have answered.

Apparently, Sharo realized that my penis was covered in semen and gave me another cleaning blowjob.

"Juryuuu...... ♡ Jyuu...... Jyuu, Chuuu...... ♡ Chuuu......"

I could hear the sound of Sharo sucking on my cock.

I let Sharo suck my dick while I spoil her with Plan's milk.

It was a fresh play for me because sucking cock and sucking tits are two incompatible activities in one-on-one sex.

With this unknown pleasure, my penis slowly started to stiffen for the third time. As I expected, I couldn't get it to stiffen rapidly.

Sharo's mouth went from cleaning to an up and down motion.

"Jubu♡ jubu♡ jubu♡♡"

She squirmed and squealed, occasionally teasing my ball sack to make my meat stick harder.

"Oh, ...... that's good, Sharo."

I pushed Puran's body back a little and looked at Sharo.

Then Sharo stares back at me with feverish eyes, saliva dripping down my penis.

"Young Master. Can I ask you for a favor ......?"

I didn't know what the hell she was going to do.

But Sharo seemed to have an idea, so I decided to let her.

"Yes."

I told her, and she smiled and then straddled me.

Then she sat down to push my penis down with her crotch, and she began to slowly rub it.

"Goo......"

Mmm......♡ Mmm......♡"

Sharo moves to rub her labia against the meat stick, and she spills out a sweet, mellow voice, as if she is feeling her way in with her own movements.

The slow rubbing, which conveyed the shape of the genitals to me, stimulated my libido significantly.

I wondered if it was her clitoris that sometimes gave me a lumpy feeling. Just the thought of it made my penis harden.

"Ahn ......♡ Young Master ......"

As she wiggled, Sharo made an inviting sound.

Even though she had a childish body, her tone of voice had the charm of a mature woman.

"Keep it in, okay?"

"Yes. ......♡"

On my back, I allowed Sharo to enter me.

It was my first time in the cowgirl position.

I had never tried this position before because I was afraid of breaking my dick.

Sharo grabbed my penis, adjusted the position, took a few breaths, and then pushed it against her vulva.

"Young Master, I'm going to insert it ......."

"Ok."

I put my hand on the base of Sharo's leg and waited for her to insert it. Since she was on her back, it was difficult to see when she was going to insert it.

As I waited in anticipation, Sharo looked at me and smiled impishly, as if she was going to say something.

"Hmm?　What's ......?

"Mmmm ♡."

But that was a fake.

The moment I let my guard down, Sharo sat up and plunged my penis all the way in.

Before I realized it, my penis was completely engulfed by Sharo.

"Oh, haha ......♡ Young master, it's in ......♡"

Sharo moves her hips in a circular motion while dripping saliva.

The rough texture of her vagina stimulated my penis, and the female-dominant position brought me a different kind of pleasure.

I'm going to give you plenty even if you don't tell me.

Sharo bounces on top of me, forcing an irresistible pleasure on me.

Her hips were light and nimble, and she was really good at it.

I'm sure she's older than me, and not that different from Puran and the others, but just by looking at her, I get a kick out of feeling like I'm being raped by a younger girl.

"Ku...... Fu...... Sharo......!"

I'm not sure if it's because I've been tickled in a masochistic way that I'm not usually stimulated, but my penis is rapidly hardening and my glans is swelling.

"Sharo, I'm cumming!"

"Ah, ah, ah♡ Ah, ah♡"

Wishing to the heavens, I ejaculated for the third time today.

Clutching Sharo's upturned hips, I continued to release my seed as hard as I could.

As my thoughts turned white with pleasure, I thought to myself, "I'm sorry for the old lady, but I should have gotten a younger girl to be my bath attendant earlier......."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 150 - State of the Kingdom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After taking a bath and feeling refreshed both physically and mentally, I changed into my nightgown and headed for my father's room.

It's been more than 12 years since I've felt this way, so I'm not sure, but I think it's about midnight now. I must have hustled a little too much.

Standing in front of the room where my father was waiting, I took a deep breath and changed my mind before knocking on the door.

"Wilk here."

"Come in."

I heard a small voice from the other side of the door, and I entered the room.

I looked at my father's desk and saw that there were no work tools there. Instead, there was a drinking vessel.

It seemed that he had finished his work and was having a drink first.

It might have been a little too much for him to have enjoyed two rounds of the three girls, a total of six shots. My father must have been tired of waiting.

"Sorry I'm late. ......"

"Good."

With a deep crease around his mouth, my father tipped back his goblet and downed it in one gulp.

I'm sure he knows what I've been up to, as he smiles despite my late arrival.

By the way, I passed the head maid in the hallway on my way to this room. Maybe she was on her way back from reporting that I was having a bath.

"I heard that the maid in the castle got pregnant."

"Ugh. ......"

My father hears all about my sex life through the servants. There was no way I could have missed the suspicion of pregnancy.

By the way, Minith is 16, and I'm 12.

Somehow, the scene that comes to mind is that of a junior high or high school student with an overactive sex drive who gets pregnant and is furious with her parents.

My father's voice is low and austere, so when he speaks plainly, it feels like he is angry with me.

"Well done."

But in the aristocracy of the Eruo continent, this is an unnecessary worry.

The more children and cousins there are between nobles and commoners, the better it is for the territory.

In addition to being able to use the useful power of magic, they do not inherit the bloodline of the main ancestor. There is no danger of a heir dispute.

The blood of the ancestors is the blood that produces magicians.

This means that they are qualified to rule and protect the land from magical beasts.

Since all the people in the noble family belonged to the ancestor, the danger of a family feud was always inherent.

In the past, in the territory of Quardenze, the relatives of the side families had become enemies through the schemes of the Kingdom of Voistra. The reason why they were able to confront the Quardenze family as enemies was because the blood of the main ancestor flowed in their bodies.

And this is not limited to conflicts between direct and collateral lineages. My grandmother, Kasia, even schemed against her own parents, who were the heads of the family, and became the patriarch.

Even so, nobles are hard to die from the effects of magic. The child of a nobleman and a noblewoman, or in other words, the child of the ancestor, if handled incorrectly, can destroy the family.

The birth of the first child is a blessing, but whether the second and third children are welcomed is not always the case.

Any child born between Minith and me would be a 100% cousin, unless Minith was having an affair behind my back.

As for the Quardenze family, they could rejoice without any worries.

"It's not confirmed yet,......."

"That's right. It's a good thing that we'll know by spring. ...... Odie too."

I had expected this when I passed by the head maid, but it seems that the suspicion of Odie's fertility has already been reported.

Since Odie is the child of the head maid and her father, I was a little concerned about her reaction.

"No need to be so uptight. I was going to nitpick, but I don't feel like it anymore."

Perhaps sensing my slight nervousness, my father continued in a light tone.

Apparently, Odie was more worried about not being able to have children than I had imagined.

When my father received the report that I had taken Odie in my arms, he was puzzled.

Aristocratic men are sexually sensitive, and blaming them for this part of their lives could diminish their sexual activity in the future. Their dicks would atrophy.

Therefore, in aristocratic society, it is important to tell them in advance, "Don't fuck that girl. It is not a good idea to scold her after the fact.

For example, in my case, I was told that I should not embrace the princesses of other domains, the female noblewomen of the empire whom I was holding captive, or the personal servants attached to my family.

Odie had a delicate position as a servant, In the eyes of my father, I might have been taken aback.

You should think about how much it pains Odie to be unable to have children. I'm going to increase your sex budget and you can go out to the castle and have a reasonable girl. That's what he was going to say. ......

"I never thought I'd see the day when Odie could have a child. ...... Huh. ......"

The face of my father, tilting his goblet at an angle, was not that of a nobleman, but only the smile of a father eagerly awaiting the birth of his grandson.

Since Odie was the only girl between my father and the head maid, my father was particularly fond of her. She looked like the maidservant when she was young and cute.

When I think of my father and Odie in everyday life, I don't think he was particularly fond of her.

But in fact, he was trying to help her find a good marriage partner and to prevent her from being sarcastic about her infertility.

He was a very lenient father to his daughter.

"No, but I didn't know Odie was pregnant yet either ......."

"I checked it out firsthand just now. I just checked it out in person. ...... I could feel a slight disturbance in the magic caused by the pregnancy, but it was very slight. She's probably pregnant."

The main ancestor and ancestors have strong bodies because they are full of energy called magical power.

Their magical power is unstable from birth to infancy, and in the case of women, it is also unstable during pregnancy.

In addition, the magical power is not always constant, but it can be affected by stress and mood.

I still can't tell the difference between mental or physical disruptions and pregnancy disruptions.

"I've told Odie that I couldn't tell the difference because the disturbance was too weak. You know why?"

"...... Yes."

If her father's diagnosis was wrong, Odie would be devastated.

Not only would she feel that she could not have a child, but she would also feel that she had brought shame to her father, the Lord.

If she was pregnant anyway, she would eventually find out naturally, so her father's decision to keep quiet was justified.

It's the first time in a long time that I'm truly happy.

He placed the goblet in his hand on the desk and exhaled deeply.

He looked at the sofa nearby and moved his chin. I guess he wants me to sit down.

I looked at the table in front of the couch and saw that there was a set of drinks ready. It's good preparation.

I followed his lead and sat down on the sofa, and my father immediately stood up and approached the sofa to be face to face with me.

"There's just too much to do."

"Thanks for your help."

My father sat down and let out a sigh again.

I've been helping him with his work when he was at New Nellie's Castle, and I'm sure my absence has reduced his manpower somewhat.

"I'm sorry ...... that I've been so busy with Nambonan City."

"No, that's not a problem, in fact it's been very helpful. If it weren't for Wilk, I really wouldn't have had time to sleep. You're a ...... dependable son.

As for the governance of Nambonan City, my father only has to look over the reports and that's it.

His own work has barely increased, and the tax revenue that comes in is enough to make him drool.

"Please continue to take care of Nambonan City."

"Of course."

I felt like a boss and a subordinate. I feel like my work has been recognized and I'm happy.

Besides, this is the house I will eventually inherit. I have no hesitation in doing my job for the Quardenze.

"I've heard that you've secured a large number of girls in Nambonan City.　I'm glad to hear that Wilk is enjoying himself."

"Hahaha ......"

I'm sure he's referring to the protected girls. I haven't touched them yet, but apparently they are my sex candidates in my father's mind.

Some of the girls were brought over from other territories, but all of them have been given my blessing to do as I please with them.

I'm lucky to be able to throw away all the troublesome diplomatic relations. He is a wonderful father who is very supportive of sex.

My father picked up the sake bottle, and poured it into the tumbler on his desk.

The beautiful amber liquid is poured into the tumbler, and they take the glasses and toast each other.

"There is a lot of confusion in the ...... kingdom."

So began my father's complaint.

As I sipped the sweet-smelling sake, I chimed in.

"It's hard work everywhere, isn't it?"

"It's not easy. ......, but the breakdown is more serious than we thought. The Kingdom of Levios may not be around much longer. ......"

The Levios royal family is currently in a tight spot.

The direct cause was the events of two years ago, but if we trace the distant cause, we can trace it back to the time of the founding of the Kingdom of Levios.

The Levios family was originally an ordinary noble family with a territory in the eastern part of the continent.

The time when the Zesu Church of the Holy High Society was enjoying the spring of the world was collapsing, and they were a successful family that successfully rode the big wave of the rise of nobility.

When the Levios family was thinking of establishing their own country, they had a problem with the noble families in the eastern part of the continent.

Today, they are known as the eastern nobility of the kingdom, but at the time, they were known as the Far Eastern nobility.

Even though the territory of the Far Eastern nobles was adjacent to the Levios territory across the great river, they did not show any attitude to join the Kingdom.

It is generally said that the Far Eastern nobles were independent, closed-minded, and conservative, and they did not want to be taken in by the larger entity of the Kingdom of Levios.

Because of this character, it was hard to imagine that they would unite and turn into an anti-Kingdom force, but from the perspective of security, the Levios family took this fact very seriously.

From the perspective of security, however, the House of Levios took this fact very seriously, and the head of the House of Levios, the first king of the Kingdom of Levios, thought of advancing across the great river to the eastern-most part of the continent.

If he could control the Levios territory and the adjacent lands alone, it would serve as a bulwark in case of emergency.

It was then that the younger brother of the first king came to the rescue.

The first king gave him the family name "Myrendorva" and allowed him to rule the new territory.

The Levios were on a roll, and they quickly invaded the northern part of the easternmost part of the continent and took over the territory.

Thus was born the Dukes of Myrendorva, a wedge against the aristocracy of the Far East.

After that, the Dukes of Myrendorva continued to fight steadily, and after a few decades, they acquired a reasonably large territory. With the help of the Levios family, he had the upper hand throughout the war.

As the war continued, the Far Eastern nobles who learned of the power of the Kingdom of Levios joined the kingdom through the mediation of the Duke of Myrendorva. This was the birth of the Kingdom's eastern nobility.

Now the eastern part of the Kingdom of Levios is safe, yay!　It is a fact of life that it does not end at .......

The trigger was the discovery of a gold mine in one of the territories of the Eastern Nobility.

Apparently, the eastern-most part of the continent was rich in underground resources, and not only gold, but also a large amount of precious stones were discovered.

This gold rush gave the eastern nobility a boost and greatly strengthened their influence.

What was not so interesting was the Levios royal family.

The reason why the Levios were so powerful was that they possessed vast fertile granaries and there were fields within their territory where gold could be extracted.

There is no doubt that the dominance of the Levios royal family was somewhat shaken when gold began to be mined in the east.

It might have been better if it had ended there.

As time passed and the first king of the Levios Kingdom died, a succession problem arose. The next head of the kingdom was incompetent beyond belief.

The one who intervened was the old Duke of Myrendorva, who was on the verge of being welcomed.

He is the younger brother of the first king, and he has been supporting his brother's great achievements. He was also the leader of the eastern nobility and had a very strong voice.

The Duke of Myrendorva told the Levios family, "My grandson is worthy to be the head of the Levios family. The Duke of Myrendorva told the Levios family, "My grandson is worthy to be the head of the Levios family, and I will put him up for adoption and give him the governorship.

If you ask me, this is a proud statement for the sake of his grandson. However, it is not easy to conclude that this statement was made out of selfishness.

In fact, the next head of the Levios family is an idiot who is recognized by everyone around him, and the grandson of the Duke of Myrendorva is so talented that even the first king liked him before he died.

It is quite possible that he was acting to protect the kingdom that he and his brother had worked so hard to build, and that he wanted to abolish a useless successor.

Unfortunately, the Duke of Myrendorva died of old age soon afterwards, so we can no longer know his true intentions.

Regardless of their true intentions, the Levios royal family was furious about this statement.

They wondered how a family that had split off from the Levios family could interfere with the main family's inheritance.

The new head of the family was particularly pissed off. His anger was understandable, since he had been told that he was incompetent.

In addition to the gold rush in the east, the new head of the family was also unhappy about something, and as soon as Duke Myrendorva died, he immediately said, "What the hell did you say to me?　Get even!　And give me all the rights to the gold mines in the east!　I'll crush you!" And he began to threaten the Myrendorva family.

To put it bluntly, it is reckless. In the first place, aside from the Myrendorva family, the eastern aristocrats had nothing to do with this matter.

As for the Myrendorva family, because there is a sense of honor to the eastern nobility, the request will be refused.

Thus began a long, long civil war between the Royal House of Levios and the Dukes of Myrendorva.

According to the Kingdom of Levios, this was not a civil war, but a family disturbance.

I guess they don't want to admit the fact that they themselves have broken the existence of the Kingdom of Levios, which their parents and grandparents had worked so hard to create.

In fact, perhaps because of the excuse of family turmoil, there was never an all-out war, and both sides would occasionally raise armies to fight each other.

The symbol of this sluggishness is the academy that exists in the royal capital.

Although it is now closed, it was originally a facility for the children of the noble families belonging to the Kingdom of Levios to deepen their relationship.

Interestingly, the Levios and Myrendorva families sent their children here despite the fact that they were at war.

In short, "It's not a war!　It's just a little family disturbance!　The kingdom is stable!　The kingdom is stable! The children's generation is interacting with each other at the school! The kingdom is stable!

In the meantime, the Levios royal family was basically winning the war, even though the war was dragging on. After all, the upstart Myrendorva family did not have that much power.

However, the Levios had no desire for territory in the underdeveloped eastern part of the country, let alone underground resources, nor did they seem to want to destroy the Myrendorva family.

The prolonged and trivial war was becoming troublesome for both sides, but the fist that had been raised could not be lowered easily. Perhaps they were trying to find a way to settle the civil war with the contact of the academy in the capital.

Up to this point, it would have been just an internal dispute.

It was two years ago that the situation suddenly changed and a major disaster occurred that involved the entire continent.

It was an extremely vicious beast that came from a field that was one of the largest in the continent.

In later years, the demonic beast was given the name of Yersinia.

Whether it was bad timing or good timing, the Levios royal family was in the middle of a war with the Myrendorva family, and their initial response to the demonic beast Yersinia was delayed.

As soon as the mature demonic beast jumped out of the field, it just ran around spreading harm as if its purpose was to defile the earth.

Yersinia, a demonic beast that had jumped out of Levios' territory, continued westward, destroying numerous villages and cities, traversing the territory of Evenapis, the home of my mother's family, entering the territory of the Empire, and eventually dying of exhaustion in the westernmost part of the continent. It was almost an east-west crossing of the continent.

But the tragedy didn't end there.

Mature demonic beasts not only defile the earth, but also spread strange diseases.

The demonic beast Yersinia also spread a strange disease. It was a horrible disease that only people with magical powers could be infected with, and if no action was taken, nine out of ten people would die.

It seemed to be especially contagious to the main ancestor, and there was even a story, true or false, that it was transmitted just by touching a letter written by an infected person.

Thus, the magical beast Yersinia caused serious damage to the Kingdom of Levios and the Empire of Zinkhaen.

Even the nobles, the main ancestors, are few in number.

In addition to the fact that aristocratic men are sexually sensitive, they are not so keen on having more children of the main ancestor because they do not have to worry about early death due to normal diseases.

In the case of my mother's family, the Evenapis family, which had been hit hard by the magical beast Yersinia, the head of the family as well as the direct heirs had almost all died out, with only my mother's grandfather remaining.

Since my mother's grandfather retired to a city far away from his home base, he had few opportunities to come into contact with other nobles, so he was not infected. However, the presence of a couple of elderly nobles would not change the situation, and the Evenapis family was no longer in danger of being infected.

The Silopeia territory, which is adjacent to the Evenapis territory, was also severely affected. The head of the Silopeia family died, and an old woman from the Silopeia family, who had also retired, became the temporary head of the Silopeia family.

The Silopeia family still has a young heir, Plume, who is still alive and has a brighter future than the Evenapis family. It's only a candlelight.

When the strange disease of the magical beast Yersinia was suddenly reported and Silopeia territory was found to be in danger, Plume happened to be visiting New Nellie Castle.

The reason why Plume had stayed at New Nellie Castle in the past was to avoid this strange disease.

The strange disease was also prevalent in the Quardenze territory, but I was able to cure it with my gory healing magic, which already boasted an enormous amount of magic power from that time.

This is why there were no deaths from the Quardenze family, and the number of deaths from the knightly families that served the Quardenze family was far less than the knightly families of other territories.

In the past, my grandmother Kasia had purged a large number of noblemen from her side of the family, so the number of people in the Quardenze family was small. If the disease had spread, the family would have been in danger of collapse.

The number of dead was small, as the followers of the Quardenze army were also gathered in New Nellie City and treated at once.

Since the number of squires of the Quardenze army was relatively large, the plan to invade the old Voistra was going well. It's a good thing I got hurt.

The nobles of the old Voistra must have been puzzled by my grandfather Galfis, who had been infected with a strange disease and was in trouble.

That's why the Levios royal family lost the trust of the nobility all over the continent at once.

To be honest, it would be wrong to blame the Levios family alone, since a mature magical beast of that scale is like a natural disaster like an earthquake or typhoon.

However, it is true that they were engaged in a stupid war and failed to take action. It is a very shameful thing for the main ancestor who is the guardian of the earth.

...... Well, I guess it's the perfect way to vent my uncontrollable grief over the loss of my family.

"The authority of House Levios has fallen. ...... In the spring, King's Landing will be a forbidden place."

"I see."

I replied somehow, and my father glared at me a little.

"It's not ....... You don't think this is just a gathering to celebrate the end of the civil war, do you?"

A large scale social party is planned for next spring in the royal capital.

It is said to be an event to show the end of the war between House Levios and House Myrendorva and the stability of the kingdom both inside and outside.

Although it is said that the war has ended with the reconciliation of the two families, in reality, the Levios family has lost.

The House of Levios, probably thinking that the damage was too great, suddenly changed into serious mode and launched an all-out attack on the House of Myrendorva.

This seems to have had two purposes. One was to end the prolonged civil war. The other was to place the blame for the outbreak of the magical beast, Yersinia, on the Myrendorva family.

But this was a bad move. It was the worst possible move.

When the Leviathans surrounded the city of Myrendorva, she suddenly appeared.

Grand Duchess Orcian.　...... No, I don't think that's what they were called back then.

The Levios family was defeated thanks to the efforts of Princess Orcian. The momentum was unstoppable, and part of the Levios territory was invaded.

The Levios family, panicked by this rapid advance, asked for reinforcements from the great nobles of the country. Somehow, they succeeded in stopping Princess Orcian's invasion and negotiated a settlement there.

"No way. I can only guess what kind of occasion the spring social will be."

A gathering to celebrate the end of the upheaval in the kingdom ...... is a story from the point of view of House Levios.

I have to think about things from the perspective of the Quardenze family. That is the perspective that is necessary for the next head of the family.

Then my father put his hand on his chin and smiled.

He drank the contents of the tumbler in one gulp and placed it on the table with a clatter.

"Then let's hear the answer to your homework."

"Homework?"

I wondered if he'd given me a math drill or something, and when I wasn't quite sure, he offered some help.

I've asked you before. You asked me once that there were two reasons why Nambonan City was overrun so quickly. I told you one of them, but I told you to think about the other one.

"Oh, ......, that's what we talked about, isn't it?"

In the beginning, my father had planned to put off the control of Nambonan City.

However, taking into account the fact that the Mana vein had been discovered nearby, that there was an abundance of building materials to be installed in the frontline base against the former Voistra, and that Viscount Galiana had tipped him off that Nambonan City was supporting the former Voistra behind the scenes, my father decided that it would be better to destroy it first rather than leave it like this.

That was the first reason.

He said there was another reason why the invasion had been accelerated, but I was told to think of it myself.

.... That look on your face, you're pretty sure of your answer, aren't you?

"Well, I don't know."

I had a lot on my mind, lest I be thought of as an incompetent son.

Why did my father want to take Nambonan City so early? What did my father hope to gain by conquering Nambonan City?

What was it that the Quardenze family needed?

"Tell me."

As if to encourage me to answer, my father extended his hand and turned his palm toward me.

My father is looking at me with serious eyes. As the next head of the family, he was probably trying to determine if he had made the right decision.

Seeing this action, I felt a little relieved.

I was convinced that the answer I had come up with was the right one.

What was necessary for the Quardenze family?

And why did my father decide to test me at this time?

There was only one answer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 151 - The Five Grand Lords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"The Quardenze Confederacy. ...... Isn't this what father truly wanted?"

I wanted to see my father's reaction, so I started with the conclusion.

But my father didn't say it was right or wrong, he just looked at me and accepted the answer.

"Go on."

His arm moves slowly, and his outstretched hand is lowered.

If you just give the answer but leave out the process, you get a fail. It was like an arithmetic test.

Thinking about the order in which I should speak, I decided to continue.

"The birth of Grand Duke Myrendorva was the deciding factor, considering the time of year. ......"

As my mother had told me when I returned from the capital, the hottest topic among the kingdom's nobles was the Myrendorva family, who had been upgraded from dukes to grand dukes.

It was after the Battle of Nambonan that I heard about it from my mother, but the actual promotion of the dukedom must have taken place before that.

My father, who frequently exchanged letters with my mother in the capital, undoubtedly knew about it earlier than I did.

"A knighthood in the kingdom doesn't mean much, does it?"

My father said this, but it felt more like a gesture to make it easier for me to talk to him than a rebuttal.

The title is meaningless. But promotion has meaning.

As my father said, in the Kingdom of Levios, which unlike the Zinkhaen Empire is more independent and self-reliant, the elevation of titles is not very meaningful.

In a sense, the Levios Kingdom is similar to the United Nations in the previous Earth. Both large and small countries are respected as independent nations, that kind of image.

Of course, there are powerful and powerless noble families, so although they are equal, it is by no means the same.

The House of Levios has gone to the trouble of preparing a title beyond the existing five titles, the Grand Dukedom. What thought went into that?"

I hadn't thought about how I would answer my father, so I spoke in a relaxed tone to buy time.

The words are full of questions, and depending on how you listen to them, you might think they are pompous.

The House of Levios has been unexpectedly counterattacked by the House of Myrendorva, which they thought they could easily crush in a pinch.

If they took their time, they might be able to push back with the power of their land, but then the civil war would continue.

The continent was being shaken by a strange disease caused by the magical beast Yersinia, and they couldn't afford to keep fighting among themselves.

In spite of the urgency of the situation, the nobles of the kingdom would give up on the Levios family if they gave priority to the civil war with the Myrendorva family.

As for House Levios, they needed to reach a ceasefire at all costs.

If they couldn't take leadership here, the kingdom itself would sink into the torrent of history.

This is tantamount to a declaration of defeat.

Even though the first Duke of Myrendorva had bad-mouthed him, the civil war had started because the Levios royal family had a problem with it.

And yet, the result of the civil war was the elevation of the Myrendorva family to the rank of knight. It was like advertising the defeat of the House of Levios at home and abroad.

The Levios made peace terms that would have destroyed their own reputation.

...... No, maybe the Myrendorva family asked for it, but either way, the Levios family swallowed it.

Despite the unbearable humiliation, House Levios chose to support the truce and the shaky kingdom.

I don't have a lot of respect for the royal family, but I wanted to learn from their actions in trying to protect their interests beyond their predicament.

And the Levios understood that they could certainly make peace with this content.

Until the arrival of Princess Orcian, the Myrendorva family had been losing.

There was no way that the Myrendorva family, an upstart power in the eastern-most part of the continent with many unexplored areas, could defeat the Levios family. There was too much of a difference in geographical strength.

Luckily, Princess Orcian was able to turn the war situation upside down in one fell swoop, but there was no telling how long that would last.

Even if they were to embrace the eastern nobility and establish the Kingdom of Myrendorva, the eastern-most part of the continent would be a cul-de-sac, and sooner or later they would come into conflict with the Kingdom of Levios.

And the longer it took, the more disadvantageous it would be for House Myrendorva. The longer it took, the more disadvantageous it would be for House Myrendorva. If House Levios were to put an end to the fiasco, the country that House Myrendorva had established would be easily crushed.

In the first place, the territory of Myrendorva is adjacent to that of Levios. It would be a fool's errand to rebel under these circumstances.

It was only natural that he would want to remain in the kingdom as the Grand Duke of Myrendorva and exert his power there.

Of course, he would have to negotiate not only for the title but also for compensation, but he could not have been so forceful in his assertions before remaining in the kingdom.

Thus, in a sense, the peace was concluded as the Levios family had hoped.

"You seem to understand the situation well. Continue."

In response to my explanation, my father did not deny anything.

I was worried that he might have a strange understanding based on his former Japanese common sense, so I was glad to be able to answer his questions.

I took a deep breath and opened my mouth again

"House Levios is finding it difficult to defy the wishes of House Myrendorva.

Even though they had made peace, House Levios could not afford to despise House Myrendorva. Considering the maintenance of the kingdom, they would like to avoid a recurrence of civil war at all costs.

Moreover, the Myrendorva family had not yet abandoned the city in Levios' territory that they had captured in a counterattack. They are currently occupying it.

The existence of Princess Orcian, who had crossed the defense line of the great river and attacked, was nothing but a threat to House Levios.

The Levios family would probably like to take back their territory eventually.

We need to keep a close eye on those cities to make sure they are not confirmed as Myrendorva territory, and try to keep the atmosphere from turning sour.

As the Myrendorva family becomes more powerful, the eastern nobility will naturally gain momentum.

The Grand Duke of Myrendorva is the leader of the eastern aristocracy, and he is like their boss.

The law that when the boss is strong, even the henchmen get carried away is the same in every world.

The problem is the Quardenze family. There is nothing good about the eastern nobles getting carried away.

The Quardenze family does not get along well with the eastern nobility of the kingdom.

It is inconvenient for the Quardenze family to have the power of the eastern nobility.

In addition to that, there are some great noblemen who have sent reinforcements to stop the invasion by Princess Orcian.

For the Levios family, it was a trump card against the Myrendorva family, so they would not be able to ignore it either.

In other words, in relative terms, the power of the Quardenze family has declined.

So, what should the Quardenze do?

If the power of speech has decreased, it must be increased.

They need to nail House Levios, and more importantly, the Kingdom's nobility, so that they are not taken lightly.

And that's the answer to my homework.

"The nail in the coffin is the Battle of Nambonan....... A coalition of noblemen with that many troops is a bit excessive when you're attacking a city with only commoners. Even if it is the child's first battle."

The aristocratic allied army had somehow been named the Quardenze allied army.

I don't care if this is the Confederation of the Kingdom's Western Aristocracy or something, the fact that it has the name of Quardenze in it just smells of politics.

If the name spread in the busy city of Nambonan, it would resonate throughout the kingdom through the voices of people.

"I heard that father sent out an invitation to the neighboring noble families to join the first battle, but the real purpose was to flush out the noble families that follow the Quardenze family, wasn't it?

My father had sent out an invitation to the neighboring noble families, saying that there was a reasonable war partner called Nambonan City and that your son was welcome to join the first battle.

When I asked him why he had bothered to make such an invitation, I still remember the strange scowl on his face.

I thought there was some kind of aristocratic scheme going on, but I didn't understand the reason at the time.

But now I know the reason.

I think they wanted to cut off the noble families who refused or gave vague replies to their invitations, and accept the noble families who gave good replies, in order to appeal to people inside and outside the country as the Quardenze faction.

Of course, there would be noble families that only have children who have already had their first battle.

For those families, I think my father used other means to force them to make a decision. More work for them.

"The Quardenze family can unite the western noble families. ....... It's a good check."

You know what happens when you despise the West, don't you?　The western aristocracy is ready to boss the Quardenze family around.

...... This was the message that was put into the Battle of Nambonan City, to the royal capital, to the kingdom's nobles.

The spread of a strange disease, the pacification of a civil war, the birth of a grand duke, and a social gathering scheduled for next spring.

The Battle of Nambonan City was the perfect time to check the kingdom's imbalance of power.

In addition, the Levios family is also doing something similar.

Immediately after the peace, House Levios called together the noble families with whom they had close ties and sent the Royal Army to the Misty Lands in the northern part of the continent.

This great expedition to the north, which triggered the downfall of Eve and Rave, was in essence a political performance to show that the power of House Levios was still alive and well.

The land of mist is basically inhabited only by the barbarians of the slave ancestors, so there's not much worry about being beaten back.

Even if they encountered them, they would only be half-mature magical beasts born in small to medium-sized fields. There is no chance of encountering a mature magical beast that was born in a large field, so this is a safe and secure expedition.

This was necessary in order to maintain the kingdom, wasn't it?　The collapse of the Levios Kingdom is something that the Quardenze family must avoid. ......, at least for now."

The existence of the Kingdom of Levios is very important to the Quardenze family, who have an enemy in the west, the old Voistra.

This allows me to focus my attention on the west with little concern for the east's defenses.

If the Kingdom of Levios collapsed, they would have to increase their vigilance in the east, which would have a major impact on the invasion of the former Voistra.

In the worst case scenario, the former nobles of the kingdom may turn against them due to the machinations of the former Voistra, and there is no guarantee that they will not have enemies in the east and west.

The Kingdom of Levios is an essential element in the war plans of the Quardenze family.

This matter is like a seesaw.

As the great nobles other than the Quardenze gained weight, we also added a heavy stone called the "Quardenze Allied Forces" to maintain the level.

Even if the Levios family, which was the board of the seesaw, had a hard time because of it, they shouldn't have cared.

If I'm not careful, the foundation of the seesaw itself may collapse under the weight, but it will take some time before it breaks, so I want to level the old Voistra as soon as possible.

When I finished, my father suddenly relaxed and let out a relieved breath.

"It looks like we won't have to worry about socializing in ...... King's Landing."

Apparently, he had received a flower circle.

"If you know so much, you know how to behave in the springtime in King's Landing, don't you?"

"You are expected to act not only as a member of the Quardenze family, but also as the leader of the western nobility. ......"

That's right.

This means that I need to socialize with dignity so that the West is not taken for granted.

I've never been out of the Quardenze territory much before.

My father must have wanted to know in advance that I had the social skills and political judgment not to be pushed around in the scheming royal capital.

That's why he's testing me right now.

"It's great that we were able to show them so much action at ....... Thanks to that, we were able to suppress the noble families that the Quardenze family needed. ...... hehehe."

My father spills out the words as if talking to himself and smiles. It seems that the overwork has paid off in spades.　

He takes another gulp of alcohol and lets out a breath that smells of alcohol.

"The factions that have been hiding in the shadows of the big tree that is the House of Levios are finally coming out into the open. The weaker nobles will be forced to choose which faction they want to join. ...... One wrong move could easily split the country."

I picked up a tumbler and quenched my thirst with the amber liquor.

My father looked at us to make sure we were drinking, and then opened his mouth again.

The kingdom is now divided into five parts: the royal family, the eastern part, the western part, the southern part, and the northern part.

As the Kingdom of Levios is vast, there are many noble families.

However, as we all know, it is the shade of a big tree, and it is human nature to fall in love with those in power.

Even though the Kingdom of Levios is a country, it is not a monolithic state with a strong central authority as the Japanese of the previous generation might have imagined. It is more like a collection of noble families, and even though they are nobles of the kingdom, they cannot rely on the Levios royal family. Therefore, each noble family is forced to pay attention to the most powerful noble family in the region.

As my father said, there are five noble families with strong power in the current Kingdom of Levios.

The east, west, north, south, and southwest are the approximate locations as seen from the royal capital.

Aside from the western noble house of Quardenze, the northern and southern noble houses seem to be located in the northwest or southwest, but for the sake of clarity, they were simply shown as east, west, north, and south.

"The first problem that will arise when the kingdom splits is the relationship between these two families, the northern and southern."

"The Northern ...... House Aterahan?"

The Aterahan family is the head of the northern nobility.

It is a noble family with a domain in the rugged mountains and bases in scattered basins.

The Aterahan family is a noble family based in basins scattered throughout the rugged mountains.

The quality of stone extracted from the Aterahan region is so good that the name "Aterahan" is known throughout the continent.

Stone from the Aterahan region is said to have been used for the Corpa Cathedral in the Holy City of Maguaose, which was built about 500 years ago.

Considering the distance between the Aterahan region and St. Navenpos, it would have been a big project to transport the stones, but the fact that they were able to do so shows the power of the Holy High Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The Aterahan family, a royal noble family, has a history of only about 100 years.

Originally, it was a different family name, but after the unification of the Aterahan region, the family name was changed to Aterahan.

As an aristocratic family, the Aterahans are characterized by the strength of their army.

Aterahan territory is full of mountains, but there are many fields. The northern part of the territory is adjacent to the Land of Mists, and on rare occasions, mature demonic beasts may come across the great river to attack.

The Aterahan army, which is forced to be constantly aware of battle, is extremely skilled, and because they are required to act quickly, the armies in various parts of the territory often move independently, and their mobility is unparalleled.

They ......, or perhaps it would be better to say they, since the head of the Aterahan family is a woman.

They were proud to be the guardians of the land, stopping the mature demon beasts from invading the kingdom at the water's edge.

Based on their track record of defeating them, the Aterahan army is said to be the best force in the Kingdom of Levios.　

In fact, it was the Aterahan army that responded to the request of House Levios and came as reinforcements to stop the Myrendorva army and Princess Orcian from crossing the great river and approaching the royal capital.

Princess Orcian made several single-armed assaults to open up the battle line, but she was forced to stop her advance due to the skillful tactics of the Aterahan army.

The Aterahans are also a force to be reckoned with as a Quardenze family.

Their relationship with the Quardenze family is not bad, but it's not great either.

They are gaining more and more say in the matter by sending reinforcements, so we have to make sure that we don't turn them to the enemy side.

After all, the kingdom now tends to be biased towards the east and the north.

And even though we have a friendly relationship, we don't know how the Zeldmitra family will react.

The Zeldmitra family is the boss of the kingdom's southern nobility.

It is said that the Zeldmitra family opened the way for the rise of the nobility after the era of the absolute power of the Society of the Holy High Priestesses came to an end.

In the past, the center of the continent was the holy city of Maguaose, home to the headquarters of the Holy High Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The closer you got to the Holy City, the more developed the city was, and the more populated it was. At that time, the Levios territory was nothing more than a countryside.

However, the situation changed drastically with the Navenpos Papal War that started about 200 years ago. The cities closer to the Holy City were adversely affected by this war.

Cities that used to be peaceful and urban fell as if the cards had been flipped.

Looking at the current kingdom, the noble families with territories far from the holy city, such as the Levios, Myrendorva, Aterahan, and Quardenze, are the most powerful, and the noble families with territories in the north are the most powerful.

In such a situation, the Zeldmitra family, which is located in the southernmost part of the kingdom, is so powerful that it is called the five great noble families of the kingdom.

This is because the head of the Zeldmitra family at the time of the war was an exceptional hero.

At that time, the head of the Zeldmitra family decided to distance himself from the Holy High Society after seeing the prolonged turbulent times.

When I learned about it in my history studies, I thought it was too ordinary an idea, but in that era, running a territory without the involvement of priests was quite a novel and innovative idea.

It is said that the eldest son of the House of Levios, who would later become the first king of the Kingdom of Levios, was deeply impressed by this idea and decided the path the House of Levios should take.

In a sense, the Zeldmitra family was the catalyst for the birth of the Kingdom of Levios.

After the founding of the kingdom, when the Zeldmitra family showed their willingness to join the kingdom, the first king welcomed them with open arms.

While protecting their backs with the shield of the kingdom, the Zeldmitra family attacked and annexed the war-torn southern territories.

Although often overshadowed by expansionism, the Zeldmitra family was a good ruler of the common people.

Without the people, there is no land to protect," said the head of the Zeldmitra family at the time, and it became a family motto.

At that time, the priests and the nobility were very coercive towards the commoners, so their policies were enough to win the hearts of the people.

Perhaps, though, there is an element of calculation in this. It was a strategy to build up his reputation and strengthen his territory by accepting refugees from the raging Holy City and surrounding areas.

Even now, the Zeldmitra territory seems to be continuing its people-friendly policy, and it is highly supported by the people.

If they are going to be kind to the people, it would be better if they stopped their expansionism, but there is a reason why they cannot do that.

There is a lot of land in Zeldmitra that has been left untouched by the warfare of the Holy High Society.

Because of the pollution caused by mature magical beasts, there is a large amount of land that cannot be touched until it is naturally cleansed.

In years when the weather is not favorable, it is not uncommon for famine to occur.

In addition, it was not blessed with mineral resources like the Myrendorva and Aterahan families, and I had never heard of any specialties.

There was always the possibility that if the people left, the territory would fall in a flash.

In the Kingdom of Levios, the two territories that produce the most food are Levios and our own Quardenze, but this one is closer.

Therefore, when a famine occurs in Zeldmitra, we sometimes provide them with food, and we have a friendly relationship.

Eastern nobility, Grand Dukes of Myrendorva.

Western nobility, the Marquesses of Quardenze.

Southern nobility, the Marquesses of Zeldmitra.

Northern nobility, the Marquesses of Aterahan.

And in the center, the Royal House of Levios.

These five are the five most influential noble families in the Kingdom of Levios.

"According to Earthworm, the Zeldmitra family has yet to unite the factions."

Worm.

This is the secret language of the intelligence agency that exists in the Quardenze family. It's the so-called covert, NINJA.

Perhaps it's the culture of the Luo continent, but earthworms are thought to be immature snakes.

The coat of arms of the Quardenze family is based on the motif of a snake entangled in a crossed spear and the spray of a great river.

The snake is the symbol of the House of Quardenze.

An earthworm serving a snake. It is said to be a companion of the snake that hides in the earth and gathers information.

Originally, only the head of the family knew about its existence, but I happened to know about it.

When I tried to create a NINJA-like agent in the pioneer society, the earthworm approached me.

"I'm sorry," he said, "but we already have something like that."

"I see.:

What do you think, Wilk, about how the Quardenze family should act?"

My father, who had just finished collecting his homework, must have been in the mood for a chat, but since the topic was political, he couldn't reply carelessly.

My head spun frantically as I wondered if I should take advantage of the confusion of the Zeldmitra family, which was still in disarray, to increase the number of the Quardenze faction in the south.

"...... I think we should casually help the Zeldmitra family consolidate their faction."

"Ho?"

My father had just told me that he had the nobility that the Quardenze family needed.

My father, who is good at politics and diplomacy, is like that, which means that the current situation is the best. There is no point in unnecessarily expanding the number of factions.

If the number of factions increased too much, the western aristocracy would become nothing more than a bunch of crows.

Besides, it would be better not to worsen relations with the Zeldmitra family by trying to reach out to them.

I also had one more thought in mind.

"Now that the Quardenze have consolidated the western part of the city, if the Zeldmitra want to increase their faction, they will inevitably look towards the north. If the Aterahans and the Zeldmitras were to fall out in the process of forming a faction, the Quardenze would be able to act as a mediator between the two houses."

If this goes well, even if the kingdom splits in the worst case scenario, we will be able to reduce the danger in the east by having House Aterahan and House Zeldmitra engage in a standoff.

I'm sorry to the two families that will be in conflict, but as a Quardenze Wilk, I have to think of the Quardenze family first.

"The most desirable thing for the current Quardenze family is for the kingdom to be maintained."

While the eastern, northern, and western parts of the country are gaining influence one after another, it is not good that the southern part is lagging behind in factional adjustments.

It is necessary for the five major noble houses to maintain a sense of tension in the kingdom.

My father nodded his head in satisfaction and pointed a bottle of wine at me.

That seemed to be the end of the serious talk, and my father's next words were, "Lately, Fanny has been showing her feminine side and becoming more feminine.

It was such a big drop that I almost fell over myself.

I didn't understand what he was saying, though.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 152 - Map of Continents 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

　This is the influence of the continent of Luo.

　It seems that the general forces have finally been exhausted.

　It's been a long time .......

As the number of noble relations is increasing, I made a family tree.

The one with the crown symbol is the current head of the family.

My grandfather Galfis was adopted as a son-in-law by the Quardenze family, so I used strange lines to represent him.

He is actually from another noble family.

I think it was hard to understand the location in the previous episode, so I've included a map of the territories within the Kingdom of Levios.

The Levios and Myrendorva families have been mentioned before, but the Aterahan and Zeldmitra families are making their first appearance.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 153 - End of Year
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The noble families are busy at the end of the year.

As the new year is full of events, the end of the year is inevitably hectic with preparations.

Usually, a few days after the new year, all the knights in the territory gather in New Nelly City.

They come to greet their masters for the New Year.

Of course, the knights do not come alone. The knight's companion, children, attendants, baggage handlers, and so on, there are many people accompanying the family alone.

Since all the knights serving the Quardenze family come to the castle, the number of guests is quite large.

Moreover, this New Year's greeting is not something that ends with a single word, "Happy New Year," as it should.

The knights would be staying at New Nelly Castle or in New Nelly City for about half a month, and this would be taken care of by the Quardenze family.

So the civil servants at New Nellie's Castle were busy making arrangements for lodging, preparing for the banquet, coordinating the schedule for the knights' visit, and arranging souvenirs to give them when they left.

I'm not that busy, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

This is because one of the New Year's events is a performance of one's art.

It was customary for the son of the head of the family to do this, and Fanny and I were asked to perform a trick in front of the family and the knights.

It's kind of like a New Year's party.

Well, even though it was a one-shot performance, we didn't put our dicks on Fanny's head and perform "chonmage".

It was more like a presentation of the results of dance, musical instruments, and singing. To be honest, it's not a very fun event.

If I were going to do it, I'd like to perform a pleasant trick like lining up the maids on the stage and ejaculating into their vaginas one after the other.

With that thought in the back of my mind, I continued practicing my trick.

"...... like leaves swaying in a great river......"

I played the lines as if I were singing and danced, waving the dagger in my hand.

The more the latter part of the song, the more disordered his breathing became, but he gathered his strength to raise his voice, saying, "I have one more breath.

"...... I am the serpent ...... of Quardenze."

He then tightens his face as he turns his gaze to the audience.

He swung the dagger high in the air in a straight line and spat out his final words.

"Well done."

The man in charge of teaching me bowed his head.

"It's been a while since I've shown anyone. Hasn't it gotten dull?"

"Your entire body language has been refined. I'm glad to see you've been practicing."

This year's one-shot performance was a play, with only one performer, me, playing multiple roles and cutting out a scene from a long story. The show will last about ten minutes.

While catching my breath, I listened to my instructor's general comments and suggestions for improvement.

He is a member of an actual theater company in New Nellie, and he has taken full advantage of his aristocratic power to invite professionals as teachers.

They are paid according to the number of times they come here, so they practice very diligently.

The theaters in the city are of a certain size, but not big enough to be called grand theaters. It must be hard to make ends meet with just the usual salary.

This time, I was going to perform a part of a popular play, "The Red Devil and the Princess of Goryo," based on my grandfather and grandmother's old story.

As a child of a noble family, it is standard for me to perform a play that has been handed down as a classic, but I chose this one as an irregularity.

There was no way that there would be a knight in the Quadrant who didn't know about his grandmother, so it wouldn't be badly received.

Speaking of being popular, Fanny's one trick is dancing. Her movements are so cute that she is sure to be well received by the men.

Sometimes you can see her practicing in the garden, and the way she moves her hips is irresistible. I couldn't help but want to shake my hips as well.

After a while of practicing for fine tuning, I had the instructor step back.

After a few moments of practicing the fine adjustments, I had the instructor step back, and Tesh came up to him as if to replace him.

"Young master, what are your plans for the afternoon, ......?"

Tesh says, wiping my forehead with a handkerchief.

It had been a long time since I had practiced in this cold, sweat-soaked weather.

"We're going to the villa."

Minith, who is suspected of being pregnant, is currently living in a villa.

She's a citizen of New Nellie, so it seems like she could go back to her parents' house, but for safety reasons, she's being forced to live in a villa.

She'll probably end up as my concubine.

Yesterday, I couldn't go to the villa because it was late at night, but since I had impregnated her with my seed, I wanted to go check on her as soon as possible.

I wanted to check on her as soon as possible.

When I insisted that I wanted to go check on Minith, Tesh immediately nodded.

Another servant who was waiting nearby bowed lightly and left the room. He must have gone to give them a heads-up.

When he opened the window, the cool winter air felt good as it caressed his body, which was burning from the exercise.

The villa, which had been my late uncle Gardakul's mansion, was the same as usual.

The knight and his family would not be staying at the mansion, so there were no special preparations for the new year.

Unlike the castle, where the atmosphere was somewhat unsettled, the villa was enveloped in a calm atmosphere.

"Young master. This way, please."

"Oh."

For some reason, it was not Tesh who led me, but the head maid.

After we talked about going to the villa, I thought it was taking a strange amount of time to get ready, but then the head maid came.

I couldn't even ask her why, because she said she was accompanying me today, with or without saying anything.

"Come in."

After knocking several times on the door, the head maid walked into the room.

I followed her through the door, and there stood Minith, Eve, and a middle-aged woman who appeared to be a healer.

On the carpet on the floor, there were three of my cousin's babies that Lupetta had picked up. They seemed to be sleeping soundly.

They are five short, but they must be in a separate room since they will be given up for adoption at the beginning of the year.

"Welcome back, young master."

When Minith spotted me, she gave a flowing, polished bow.

I'm not sure if it was because I was in front of the head maid, but there was no sweet gesture towards me in that bow, only a form of master-servant relationship.

"Ah ......, master, welcome back ......."

Then Eve greeted Minith awkwardly.

Because of her large eyes, I can see the way her emotions fluctuate.

I can clearly see that she is not even a little bit happy about my return.

When I glanced at Eve's chest, my gaze was caught by a bulge that had grown well for her age.

It looks like it's getting even bigger again. That's good.

It's not good to stare at Eve's tits too much, so I step closer, keeping my eyes on Minith.

"Minith?"

"Yes?"

I said gently, but the reply was that of a servant.

I exhaled and looked at the head maid.

"..... Minith. You don't need to worry about me. You've been looking forward to the young master's return for a long time, haven't you?"

"Yes, but..."

Minith is the type of person who is serious about her work, so it must be awkward for her to flirt with her boss in front of him.

I don't think she's so thick-skinned that she wouldn't mind being told not to worry about it.

There was no point in exchanging pleasantries here, so I walked closer to Minith.

"Minith, he's back."

"Oh, ......."

I hugged Minith, who was standing upright with her hands on her crotch, slowly wrapping my arms around her.

This is the first time in a long time that I've tasted her flesh and body odor, and it sweetly stimulates my brain.

My woman.

It was a sweet sensation that forced me to be aware of that.

"......♡"

I could feel Minith's breath as if it were melting.

I placed my hands on her shoulders as I hugged her close and gradually lowered them, moving them from her arms to her elbows and from there to her hips.

"Can I touch you?"

I asked, showing Minith the palm of my other hand, which was now free.

Of course, she didn't want me to touch her cunt or ass, but her stomach.

She might be carrying my child in her belly.

"Y- yes."

Her voice was a little shaky, but I pretended not to notice and touched her belly over her clothes.

It was the stomach of a normal girl of her age, not pudgy or with six-pack abs.

But I've been pouring a lot of semen into it over and over again. I can only imagine what it would be like to have a child.

I had repeatedly ejaculated into her vagina with the intention of impregnating her every time, but I hadn't thought too much about becoming a father at my age.

It's your father. ......"

I lightly called out to the being who might be there.

In my previous life, I was not involved in marriage or childbirth, so I wanted to try this kind of at-home behavior at least once.

I felt a little embarrassed, but now I had fulfilled the regrets of my previous life.

However, Minith's body trembled greatly in response to my action.

"Young Master, ......."

Tears began to spill from her eyes as she called out for me.

She turned her head to hide her face from me, and the tears fell on her chest, staining her white clothes darkly.

"....., what's wrong?"

"Young master, ......."

After saying that, Minute hugged me as if leaning against me.

What a bold move, even though the head maid was right in front of me.

"Gusu......Wilk-sama......I like......I like......"

Minith clung to me, calling out, "I like, I like, I like."

I'm genuinely happy to see her do that, but I don't understand why she suddenly became so emotional.

I wonder if she's having maternity blues and is mentally unstable.

I glanced at the head maid, but she just looked annoyed.

Eve was staring at Minith with her hands on her cheeks.

"All right, all right, Minith. What's the matter?"

I stroked her trembling back and waited for her to speak.

"I'm happy ...... young master, ugh ......."

Minute's sobbing words were difficult to understand, but what she wanted to say was simple.

She was very happy that I hadn't suspected anything about her pregnancy.

Minith had been questioned by the servants every day since her pregnancy was suspected.

They always asked her if the child was really his, or if it was not the result of her playing with a man in the city.

Since there was no such fact, Minith replied that she was not unfaithful, but it was unbearable to be asked such unpleasant questions every time.

Not that I'm defending the servants, but there is a scary part of Minith's pregnancy from an aristocratic point of view.

If she is really pregnant with my child, there is nothing wrong with it. It's just a happy ending.

But what if this is a child born from an affair with a commoner man?

As a rule, a child born between a slave ancestor and a slave ancestor can only become a slave ancestor. In other words, the affair would be exposed immediately.

Basically, aristocratic men are very sensitive about sex. They would be shocked to find out that their first pregnancy was the seed of another man.

If Minith had been unfaithful, the sexually active young lady might have become impotent. ...... It was understandable that my father and the servants would think so.

The servants were desperate to hear what he had to say, but it was inevitable, if I may say so. It must have been hard for Minith, though.

"Young master......Wilk-sama......"

Minith said she thought it would be unbearable if she was suspected by me too.

He didn't know that, but she was very happy that I said, "I'm your father!"

He was not even thinking of Minith potential cheating on him, and the way he said it in a trusting and carefree way really touched her.

In fact, I hadn't even the faintest thought that she would cheat on me.

"Well, ...... that was hard ......."

"It's okay,...... that young master, young master believed in you,...... that's all,......."

Minith's arms were quite strong as she hugged me.

I could directly feel her passionate desire to not let go and not let go.

I was genuinely happy that she was thinking of me this much, and I just loved her.

And when I thought that my baby seed was sprouting inside this lovely body, I felt madly in love with it.

"How could I doubt it?"

"Young Master ......"

The passion drew out the words I had been too embarrassed to say to anyone.

"Minith. I love you. ......"

"Oh!"

There are several expressions of fondness in Luo language.

I think I've whispered the Japanese translation of the word "love" to many women, but I've been too embarrassed to say the word "love" to any of them.

It's a strange thing to be embarrassed by a single word when you've hugged so many.

"...... I love you too!　Oh, I love you ......, young master ......!　Oh ......♡"

Minith slumped down, her head hanging limply.

Her body was like melted cheese.

"It's a little embarrassing ......."

I pressed my nose into Minith's hair and covered my face.

I was excited to see the head maid, Tesh, and even Eve here.

If it wasn't for the fact that I suspected she was pregnant, I would have started mating her right then and there.

Minith and I stood there in the embrace for a while in silence.

We felt each other's heartbeats, and the presence of our beloved there.

"Young master!"

They stood there for a while in silence, feeling each other's heartbeats, feeling each other's presence.

"I'm sorry, but I can't take much more of this. Please, ......."

The maidservant, who had been standing beside me for some time, looked at me with a worried expression.

"Yes, I know."

The reason why the head maid went to the trouble of following me was to interrupt the lovemaking time between me and Minute.

I'm sure she thought that a half-hearted servant would not be able to stop me, and that's why the maidservant talked instead.

Since science is still underdeveloped in the continent of Eruo, there are many unfamiliar customs and superstitions.

The fact that earthworms are thought to be related to snakes probably has something to do with that.

There are many such superstitions in pregnancy, and what the head maid just said is widely believed.

It is the jealousy of the baby.

I don't know what it is, but it is said that when a pregnant woman is close to her husband, the fetus gets jealous and comes out.

To put it simply, it means that the baby will miscarry.

Befriending ...... means that you should not kiss, hug, or engage in any other sexual behavior with your husband during your pregnancy.

It is said that if you are too close to your husband, the baby inside your belly will get jealous and come out, saying, "Don't be too close to your daddy all the time, mommy.

It's a superstition that makes babies seem like a kind of monster, but it's widely believed in the Eruo continent.

Odie, who thinks I'm a boob-loving man, once verbally warned me not to rub Minith's tits.

After the maidservant's words, Minith regained her composure and slid away from me, hugging her stomach and talking to herself.

"It's okay. It's okay. ......"

She was trying to calm her jealousy by taking care of the baby in her belly.

If I insisted that such superstitions were wrong, the head maid would probably back down, but there was no reason to dare.

And since Minith also believes in this superstition, forcing my idea on her will only cause her stress.

"Chief maid, you've done well to stop me."

The head maid only gave a small nod in response to my words.

"If I just want to come and check on her from now on, is there a problem?"

"No. I'm sure Minute would feel more at ease if he could see the young master."

I guess it's safe to assume that I've been granted permission to visit

"I'll keep coming back to check on you, but I don't think I can do it every day. If you want to meet with my parents, you can tell them. I'll have them make arrangements."

"Thank you."

Minith expressed her gratitude, but apparently the head maid had arranged for her to see his parents every now and then.

She was more than happy to hear that I would continue to visit them.

Minith was really adorable when her affection for me was on full display. I wish Eve would learn a little from her.

"...... Speaking of which, why is Eve here?"

When I turned to the subject, Eve gave a small shudder and hugged my arm.

"Because the pioneer society is closed. ...... Its ......"

Eve goes to the pioneer society to practice her manuscript writing, but if it's closed, she probably has nowhere to go.

"Eve is taking care of the babies."

Minute added, as if to help Eve with her slurred speech.

Apparently, Eve has quickly become friends with Minith, the new resident of the villa, and on her days off they knit together and take care of the babies.

I've been thinking ...... for a while now, but I think Eve has great communication skills. I've always thought that Eve is a good communicator.

I've been friends with Mimmon, and I've been friends with Minith. It's a situation where my women have been conquered by Eve.

She's not getting along with me at all.

If this happens, we'll have to make out in bed tonight.

"My Lord. ......"

"What is it?"

When I looked at her, Eve's face turned into a scowl.

"The potter's uncle said he had something he wanted to show Master. ......"

"The potter?　...... Ah, the production department. I wonder what it is."

The production department of the pioneer society makes a wide variety of things, from silk and soap to guns, books, and arithmetics.

Some of them are even craftsmen who make pottery and porcelain.

If they have something to show us, they must have succeeded or made progress in some project.

But there are so many projects going on in parallel in the pioneer society that it's hard to guess which one they are talking about.

"They told me to say white plates."

"Oh, that."

The Eruo continent had an excellent ceramic culture.

This is in the past tense.

The holy city of Maguaose was once known as the city of ceramics.

The priests of the Holy High Society of the Zess had their own workshops and potters, and they produced a number of unique ceramics to meet the demands of the entire continent.

However, all of this was lost in the war that broke out 200 years ago.

Today, St. Navenpos seems to have the idea of the Rebirth Principle, and there are many movements to reclaim the former glory of the Holy City.

This movement included the revival of ceramic culture.

However, once a technique is lost, it cannot be regained overnight.

Although the ceramics produced in the Holy City today are numerous, the quality is far lower than it was in its heyday.

Even I, a person who does not know much about pottery, can easily distinguish between plates from before and after the war.

Just as pure white silk is revered, pure white porcelain is also revered and in demand by the nobility and wealthy.

However, the current demand is not being met in the continent of Eruo.

It is said that the production areas of the clay and stone used to make porcelain were severely damaged by mature magical beasts that appeared in the midst of the war.

It is said that the production areas of clay and stone, which are used to make ceramics, were severely damaged by the appearance of mature demonic beasts.

That is why most of the "pure white porcelain" that is now being sold in the world was made before the war. Because of their limited numbers, they are very rare and valuable.

When I first started the pioneer society, I bought some potters from slavers to make my favorite plates and cups.

One of the tasks I gave to the potters was to make white porcelain.

I had heard that white porcelain could be made from cow bones in the previous Earth, so I thought it would be possible to make something similar on the Eruo continent.

It was probably about five or six years ago. If the results were positive, it was a good decision to spare the money for development and research.

I would like to go check it out as soon as possible.

If the product is good, we can appeal to the public as a new specialty of Quardenze in the spring in the royal capital.

Minith clapped her hands together and opened her mouth, as if the mention of the pioneer society had stimulated her memory.

"I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that the new underwear that Young Master ordered has arrived. They are for me and Eve."

I had asked my good friend at the clothing store to make some bras for us.

I ordered them in addition to a set of outfits for the spring social, but they seemed to be finished quite quickly.

The reason why I bothered to have such a thing made was because I wanted to hold a woman who wore both top and bottom underwear exactly the same way. It's just my obsession.

"I didn't wear it out of respect, but ......"

She said that the current minidress didn't wear it because she felt it was too tight.

Her own mother and the head maid stopped her from wearing it, saying that it would make her breast milk flow worse.

That's why Eve was the only tester of the prototype.

I moved my gaze to Eve's chest.

Her breasts seemed to have grown larger somehow, perhaps due to the effect of the underwear.

Chapter 154 - Deliciously eating the elf slave girl in her underwear who is becoming obedient (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 2008, Dr. Morgen, an authority on social psychology, conducted a slightly different academic study in 41 countries and regions around the world.

The idea was to investigate the causal relationship between male sexual preference bias and the region of birth and upbringing.

After two years of research and another four years of verification and writing, the paper was completed and published in the French academic journal "Mensonge".

In this paper, the fetishism and its tendencies of men living in the world are introduced in a very naked way.

Let's take a look at it.

According to the survey conducted by Dr. Hagiwara, the sexual preferences of Japanese men are very distinctive.

This characteristic is that there is a large number of underwear fetishists.

The percentage of men who are highly sexually aroused by women's underwear is exceptionally high in Japan, at 16.1 percentage points, compared to the global average of 5.8 percentage points. The percentage of men who are highly sexually aroused by women's underwear was 16.1 points in Japan, compared to the global average of 5.8 points.

The paper concludes that there is a deep causal relationship between the results and Japanese society, though it does not go into the details of his reasoning and discussion.

To summarize, he writes: ...... Compared to other countries, there are more opportunities for children in Japan to be exposed to manga and anime from an early age. And in Japanese manga and anime, lolis are often an important element of feminine appeal.

As a result, Japanese men are unconsciously imprinted with the equation that "seeing underwear = sex" from an early age, when their sexuality is not even budding.

In this way, the deep consciousness that has quietly seeped into the recesses of the mind eventually awakens from its long hibernation with the onset of sexuality.

In his paper, he also makes a prediction.

He also predicted in his paper that the number of people who have a fetish for underwear would increase at an accelerated rate as Japanese manga and anime spread around the world.

At ......, I was lying in bed, vaguely fantasizing about a doctor who doesn't exist and a paper that doesn't exist.

What I was trying to say was that it's great to be in your underwear.

"I'm getting ready to bathe you, so please call me when you're done."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Tesh bow once and leave the room.

He had gone to call Eve.

I've decided to stay at the villa today. Tomorrow morning, I will not return to the castle because I have made plans to visit the pioneer society in the morning.

This meant that I would have plenty of time to enjoy Eve tonight.

She was wearing a bra and panties set that she had commissioned from a clothing company and had finally completed, and there was no way she was going to leave without hugging her.

"Hmmm... ......"

Stripping a twelve year old girl of her regular clothes and putting her in her underwear.

Just the thought of it made my cock harden to the point of tearing my pants.

The next thing I knew, I was humming to myself.

"It's Eve."

As I was playing with my cock on my clothes, there was a knock on the door and I heard a voice.

"Come in."

With a clink, Eve came into the room.

She was wearing the same clothes that I had seen her wearing at lunch, the kind of clothes that the daughters of wealthy people in New Nelly would wear on a regular basis.

It looked like a dress at first glance, but in fact it was a type of clothing where the skirt and jacket were separated at the waist.

It was characterized by large design-oriented buttons and detailed embroidery in orange thread from the shoulders to the sleeves.

The fabric was colored a dark red, making it look heavy and warm.

"Um, I've been summoned, so I'm here."

Eve stopped a short distance away from the bed and said in a strange tone.

She didn't seem to understand that when I called her to the bedroom, my business was nothing but sex.

Maybe she was letting her guard down because she usually put on an erotic camisole-like outfit after bathing.

"Sit here."

I could feel Eve's breath catch in her throat when I placed my hand on the bed with a pop.

I'm sure she knows what she's doing, but her frown is short-lived, and she quickly approaches me with a fake smile.

"Heh, heh, heh. ............"

I hugged Eve's waist as she sat next to me, and she smiled deliberately.

Her body felt a little stringy in my arms, but it was also comfortably firm.

"What's wrong?　You look happy."

It didn't look like it, but I decided to use it as a conversation starter.

Perhaps she thought I was fooled by her fake smile, but she looked a little relieved and opened her little mouth.

"I'm so glad you remembered ...... me."

Despite the fake smile, it sounded like she meant what she said.

Somehow, I think she tends to look at me when she's lying and avert her gaze when she's revealing her true feelings.

Of course, I don't think she's happy that I'm holding her, but that I'm not going to get tired of Eve and return her to the slavers.

I have to give her credit for getting the idea of being a sex slave. You need a rewarding kiss.

"...... chu."

"......"

As an aperitif, I enjoy a light kiss. The soft, youthful lips are very tasty.

I deepened the kiss as I licked her pouty lips with my tongue.

"My little Eve. Chu......"

"Amu...... churlish...... chu......."

My tongue invaded her mouth and caught her heated tongue.

The mucous membranes intertwine with the mucous membranes, and the stimulation causes saliva to spill out, making a sizzling sound.

I savored it, and then she did, too.

"Pwe......"

Her breathing was getting tighter, and her voice had a lusty quality to it, almost like she was panting.

"Juru-chu, eve...... chu, chu..."

"Mmm...... puh...... mmm......."

I sucked Eve's tiny tongue as if it were a vacuum cleaner, inviting it to my mouth for a sweet bite.

I was surprised by the hard impact of her teeth, and I couldn't resist the feel of her tongue with its twitch and hardness.

Our breaths are ragged, and I can feel her exhale against my face.

We're the same age, after all, and our height and sitting height make it easy to kiss.

I stroke the back of her head and finally press my lips to hers as hard as I can before releasing her.

"Huh. ......"

"............mmm...... Master......"

I hugged Eve again, who casually wriggled her hips to get away from me.

I'm not going to let you get away with it, because my lower body is already in a procreative position.

"Oh, ......, ......, ............."

When I press my face against her neck, I can smell a different scent than when I bathe. It's a body odor from a full day of activity.

Perhaps it's because she's young and has an active metabolism, but there's a good scent unique to girls that I can't put into words.

It is the scent of a girl on her way to becoming a woman, a scent that can ruin a man.

"Oh no, ...... master, please don't, ...... I haven't bathed yet, ...... oh no, ......"

I was amused by Eve's reluctance to move, and I became absorbed in sniffing her.

He sniffed Eve's hair, armpits, and behind her ears, making deliberate giggling noises.

"No bath today. I'll give you plenty of love, okay?"

"Oh, ............, yes. ...... I'm sorry, ......."

I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

If I want to play without a bath, she, as a sex slave, will have to put up with it.

I don't know why, but I want to get to know Eve, but when I see her like this, I can't help but want to tease her.

It's like an elementary school boy who wants to play a trick on the girl he loves. ...... No, there are no elementary school boys who have sex with girls they like because of teasing.

"There is no need to apologize. Let's be friends."

As I say this, I reach into her long skirt and try to touch her thighs.

"Mm......?"

But what I found was not smooth, raw skin, but stiff pants.

I hadn't noticed because the skirt covered her ankles, but apparently she was wearing pants underneath.

It was like a high school girl wearing a jersey under her sailor suit. It's a good thing that her body doesn't get cold, but it's just a hindrance in bed.

"Here, take off what you're wearing underneath."

"Yes, ......."

I stop her from suddenly trying to undo the waistband of her skirt after my words and instruct her to remove only her pants.

Eve puts her hand inside her skirt and begins to wriggle and undo it.

Her face is red with shame, and the way she pulls down her pants with her eyes shut is intriguing.

"I took them off."

"Good girl, I'll be nice to you."

When I reached into her skirt, there was nothing there to prevent my touch, but the soft, fine skin of a young girl.

While enjoying the smoothness and fleshiness of her skin, I moved my fingers closer to her important parts.

Basically, the commoner class living on the continent of Eruo wears underwear that resembles pumpkin shorts without any sense of sex appeal.

But I guess Tesh and the other servants understood that I didn't like that, so Eve wore a pair of panties.

Eve's underwear must have been tightly integrated with the panties. It's good to have sex when the backstage is doing a good job.

The feel of the soft, moist underwear. All my nerves are focused on my fingertips.

"Mmm. ......"

"Eve."

He whispered her name sweetly in her ear and bit her lip on her ears, which were stretched out to the side in the characteristic way of the elves.

"Huh?"

I pinched her ear between my lips and ran my tongue along her outer ear.

Eve let out a high-pitched squeal, her shoulders shaking as she endured the stimulation.

"Ahh ......, no, no, no ......!　Hieee ♡ Hieee!"

Her body twisting violently, I gradually undo her clothes.

Little by little, her skin was revealed, the light green bra strap with little ornamentation, her collarbone slightly raised against her white skin, and the girl gasping as her ears were attacked.

My excitement was boundless.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 155 - Deliciously eating the elf slave girl in her underwear who is becoming obedient (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Ha...... ha...... yah...... hii......."

The way Eve's clothes are disheveled is that of a girl with a bad sleeping pattern wearing a yukata at a hot spring resort.

The glimpse of underwear is really erotic.

Just as a cat will pounce on you when you flick the catnip around on the wall, a man will pounce on you when he catches a glimpse of your underwear through your disheveled clothes.

When I gently touched her exposed skin, I found that it was slightly heated.

The tongue attack seemed to have loosened her body somewhat.

"Shall I take it off?"

Without waiting for an answer, I stripped off her clothes.

"...... Master, Master ......."

I wondered what she was trying to say with that call.

Eve stared at me, then closed her mouth without continuing.

"Hmmm... ......"

As I slowly removed my clothes, I was left with only my underwear.

She was lying on her back with her arms crossed to cover her breasts and her legs twisted to hide her crotch, a pose that I could only assume was an invitation to men.

Suppressing a fluttering feeling, I gently touched her arm and untwisted it.

When I was sure that Eve was in a prone and alert position, I checked out the work of the clothing merchant I was using as my purveyor.

"This is good."

I stare at the underwear that surrounds her limbs, licking her entire body with my gaze.

The bra that protected her raw breasts looked, at a quick glance, identical to that of his previous life on Earth.

Her breasts, which had grown well for her age, were completely encased, and I could see the volume of her chest.

The rim of the cup was decorated with small flowers made of thread. As I had ordered less ornamentation, the design was simple except for the ornaments.

The pale green bra, made of New Nellie silk, was a perfect match for the girl's innocence.

The strapless panties were also a light green color and had similar floral decorations on the front and near the knot.

It's a really good job.

"......Uh......."

Eve's skin turns red as she endures my gaze in just her underwear, which is interesting to watch.

I drop a kiss on her bare skin as I slide my hand down her back and pick her up.

"Now Eve, you take off my clothes."

"Yes, yes."

With the clear instruction, Eve's expression tightened and she raised herself up.

She gets down on her knees on the bed to match my height as I stand up.

"Um, ............, I'll take that off."

Maybe the servants had taught her, but Eve had gotten a little better at undressing.

Before I knew it, my upper body was being stripped off, leaving only my underwear.

On the other hand, the bottom half of my body, Eve's fear of my cock made her much more hesitant and fearful than when I took off my jacket.

She was only wearing a bra, and her big tits, which were disproportionate to her age, swayed with every movement of her arms.

The sweet fruit, not yet ripe, was more pointy than soft, with a noticeable elasticity. They were the kind of breasts that provoked male sexuality.

"Come on."

I stroked Eve's shoulder, insisting that she take it off quickly.

I wrapped my fingers around the bra strap on her right shoulder and wiggled it up and down, enjoying the weight of her breasts. It's surprisingly heavy and fun.

My penis is not ...... visible, but the tip is probably soggy with my juices.

I'm sure that underneath my pants is a foul male smell. I'm not sure why I want to see the moment Eve's face contorts when she smells it.

"I'll put it down. ............ Ugh ......!"

As soon as his pants were pulled down, his penis sprang out with a bang! And with that, his penis shot out and rose up to the sky.

The skin was starting to peel back a little at the tip. As my body continues to grow, I'm sure I'll be able to peel it off just by having an erection without any help.

The pink glans, half exposed, was soaked with his juices and shining brightly.

"How's that?"

I thrust my hips forward and thrust my cock at Eve.

With her face half turned away, Eve slowly opened her mouth, letting out an inarticulate denial, "No!"

"It's ............ big."

"I see."

When a beautiful girl like this tells me that I have a big dick, it tickles my manly heart.

The fact that Eve really felt that my cock was big, and that she was afraid of it, made it all the more special.

I'm sure the only cocks she's ever seen are the red ones she's seen while taking care of the neighbors' babies, or her own father's cock.

It was hard to imagine any father showing off his erect cock to his daughter, let alone a baby.

The only comment I can make is "it's huge" when shown at an angle that seems to intimidate the girl.

"You know this is going to be inside of Eve, right?"

As I said this, I guided Eve's slender fingers to my penis.

I moved to the center of the bed and felt Eve's slightly cool fingertips on my feverish penis.

I moved to the center of the bed, and Eve followed suit.

With my erect penis pointed at Eve's face, I watched her in silence.

"Here, this is ......."

He instructed a bewildered Eve to peel off his cock.

She obeyed, collapsing her legs and placing her other free hand on his penis.

Eve's eyes grow serious as she secures the tip of my cock with the thumb and forefinger of both hands, four fingers in total.

It seems that she is becoming much more aware of me as her sex slave.

"I'm going to peel that ...... off. ......"

"Ok."

She grabbed my penis with a delicate hand, probably being careful not to injure it.

Eve, on all fours and with her face close to my penis, uses the four fingers of both index fingers and thumb to lower the penile skin down.

"Ah!"

The skin peeled cleanly and smoothly as it passed over the calyx.

The pink glans quivered as if it had finally been freed.

I was surprised to see the skin peeled off at once, and Eve looked up at me to see if I was in pain.

"Good girl."

I place my hand on the back of Eve's head and gently pat her head.

I pretended to be stroking her, then casually and forcefully pushed her head downward, closer to my penis.

At first, Eve didn't resist my stroking, but when she realized that her face was getting closer and closer to my cock, her neck tightened.

Like Eve, I hadn't bathed. I guess I'm psychologically uncomfortable with a penis that's soaked with the day's grime.

"Master."

Eve raised her head, flinging my arm away. The eyes that stared at me were sharp and seemed to glare at me.

But it was only for a moment, and she soon smiled a hard, flirtatious smile.

"Heh...Oh, my master......Oh...Oh, uh...penis...I'll do it...Right? 　Eh, eh?"

"Huh?"

I didn't expect Eve to suggest a blow job.

What kind of wind was blowing in my face?

"I'm going to do my best, too, so please don't throw me away. ...... I'm going to do my best, just like Minith. ...... So... ......"

Apparently, flirting with Minith in front of Eve's eyes made her feel a little threatened.

It's a really good mindset for such a young girl to actively suck a raw cock that she hasn't cleaned because she doesn't want to be sold.

You can't help but smile.

"Eve ...... is a good girl. I'm so happy for you."

I was surprised at how gentle my voice sounded. I felt that my penis had become about 30% harder and bigger than usual.

"I'm ...... glad Master is pleased with me."

"I don't want to let go of such a good girl. We'll be together forever."

"Thank you ...... very much. Ehehe ......."

Eve exhaled deeply and slowly sank her little head onto my cock.

Her posture was lowered, and her dark honey-colored hair spread out on the bed in a breeze. There was a picturesque beauty to the scene.

The way she brushed her hair back from her cheeks with one hand to keep it out of my penis was sexy beyond her years.

I stroked the top of her head, then moved my hand to the nape of her neck via the back of her head, and moved it to her shoulder blades.

The smoothness of Eve's hair was so pleasant to the touch that I found myself repeating the motion several times.

When I reached her back, my palm found a foreign object there. It was a bra.

As I fumbled with the hooks of my bra with my fingertips, I felt Eve's breath on my bare glans. It seemed that Eve was finally ready to suck on it.

"Oh ......!"

I felt something hot on the underside of the glans, and the stimulation went from the bottom to the top all at once. Apparently, she had taken a lick.

Stroking her trembling back, I silently urge her to continue.

I want her to suck on it as soon as possible, but I'll leave it to Eve's initiative and be patient.

"Mmm...... mmm......!"

A sharp stimulus went through my inner muscles two or three times.

My tongue must have been filled with saliva, because I could feel the warm liquid dripping down to my balls.

"Oh, ...... that's good, Eve ......."

The stimulation from the licking wasn't quite there yet, but the fact that Eve was giving me a blowjob turned me on.

I put my arm around her back, but she mistook it for an instruction to lower her posture, so she lowered herself even more.

She then lowered her stance even lower, resembling one of the cat stretches, where the back is lowered and the buttocks are raised.

"Rengn...... churu...... eh......."

Naturally, my eyes went to her ass. There was a bra and a pair of matching panties.

The fabric of the panties was pulled tight by the thrust of the bra, and the shape of her buttocks came into clear view.

It's still small, but it's a nice, firm ass, just like a young girl's.

"Nchu...... mmm?"

I reached out and touched the attractive curves of her buttocks, even though I was slightly trapped in front of her.

There's something about an ass that you can touch through your underwear that you can't find in a raw ass.

The smooth, silky fabric and the girl's elastic flesh underneath. It was a supreme sense of touch.

It was a supreme touch.

"Kueh...... juru, juru...... hum, hummm...... chu...... n, juru ......ju...... chupa...... ugh...... juru... ...Huh!"

The more the butt stroking turned into a caress, the more Eve's tongue slowed down.

I was very dissatisfied with Eve's blowjob, which she only licked with her tongue and didn't suck into her mouth, but I decided not to blame her for that this time.

I appreciated the fact that she decided to give me a blowjob of her own volition.

Rather than pointing out the bad points, he praised the good points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Well done, Eve. Let me pat on the back."

I put my hand on her cheek and stopped the blowjob, because I felt that if she kept doing it, it would only make me more impatient and I wouldn't be able to ejaculate.

"Really ......?"

She wiped her mouth with her wrist and looked up at me. Her green eyes were moist, as if she was saddened by her own actions, or perhaps by the pungent smell of my unwashed cock.

"Oh. You did a good job. I love it when Eve does that."

"Hooray ......."

I wrapped my arms around the relieved girl and gave her a lot of sweet words.

I praised Eve's efforts over and over again, using different expressions.

In order to imprint this rule on her, I keep repeating the words, "If you do your best to be erotic, they will be kind to you."

"Now I have to pay Eve back, don't I?"

"Huh?"

I turned Eve over in my arms and flipped her onto her back. For a moment, her hair flew around her and she smelled sweet.

"Oh, ......!　Aah!"

I grabbed both of Eve's knees and made her open them into an M shape.

Even though she was still wearing her panties, she was ashamed of her outfit and tried to close her legs. But I wouldn't let her do that.

"Master, I don't want it back. ...... Hiya!"

I ignored her words and pressed my nose against her pelvic area. I could feel the heat of her crotch through the strapless panties.

"No. ......!"

She let out a wail of pain as I sniffed her pubic area, making a whooshing, swooshing sound.

The strapless panties, full of a day's worth of body odor, stimulate my penis intensely.

This is the smell of Eve's secret place and her underwear. Just the thought of it made my penis burn hotter and hotter.

"Hiya ......, hiya ......, hiya ......, hiya ......."

While holding Eve's body firmly in place, I used my tongue to slide the fabric of her panties to the side.

The waistband may have loosened up a bit as a result of the various movements, and you can now see the secret place through the gap in the cloth, and succeed in sliding your tongue in.

"Oh ......!"

I stimulate the area around her labia with the tip of my tongue and apply a generous coating of saliva.

When I was sure that the saliva had soaked into the strapless panties, I decided to stimulate her private parts over the cloth.

I close my eyes and use the tip of my tongue to find what I'm looking for.

"Hieee, hiee!"

And then my tongue found something that looked like a round bean. It was Eve's vulva.

"Hmm!　Oh, master! ......!　Ahhh ♡......!

The stimulation was sticky and unhurried.

Perhaps because the stimulation given through the cloth was gentle, Eve did not resist violently, but instead endured the attack with occasional sad cries.

The only reason I started cunnilingus through her underwear was to enjoy the underwear play, but this subtle stimulation seemed to be good for Eve.

"Ohhh ...... haha ...... no, no ...... ugh ...... ♡ haha ...... haaa...... haa......!"

I continued to caress her, using my tongue to rub against her clitoris.

Eve's voice is 20% moaning and 80% groaning.

I moved my face closer to Eve's, crossing my arms to hide my face.

I continue to caress her, leaving only my fingers in her soggy, wet pussy.

"...... chu."

"......mmm..."

Pressing my lips together, I begin the transition to the penetration position.

The sweet sound of her voice is sending signals to my brain to hurry up and insert my cock.

I rub my penis against Eve's crotch as I move up her body. The feel of her wet string panties is indescribable.

Her breasts are lifted as she pressed against my chest, and the shoulder strap of her bra comes off to one side.

　

The messiness of my underwear was a good thing.

I'm going to put in the thing that Eve so deliciously sucked on earlier.

"......!"

Embarrassed, Eve averted her gaze and clenched her fists to withstand the pain.

My penis, completely soaked with Eve's saliva and my own juices, waited impatiently for the moment of insertion.

"Oh ......"

My penis slipped into the gap in the strapless panties. The tip caught her vulva.

"Shall we hold hands?"

I made her open her tightly clenched fist and I held her hand.

After making sure that our hands were tightly clasped in a lover's connection, I sank my body into Eve.

"Oh ......!　Oh, ......!　I'm in, I'm in ......!　Oh, ......!"

As the pleasure began to envelop my penis, my hands began to tighten their grip on each other.

The deeper the insertion, the stronger the grip.

"...... big ......, ugh ...... haaa......haaaa ......."

My cock penetrated her down to the base.

　

I looked at her body, wondering if it reached this part of her stomach, considering the length of my cock.

I felt sorry for Eve, who was struggling with the size of my cock, but the sight of her breathing hard and enduring the penetration was enough to fill a man's heart.

"Sweet Eve. My Eve."

The sight made me want to kiss Eve's skin with love.

I sucked on her skin hard enough to leave a hickey to assert that this little girl belonged to me.

If I move badly, I'll be all over Eve's vagina, which is tight, narrow, and fissured.

I carefully made a very slow pistoning motion, savoring the shape of her vagina.

"Huh. ......!　Huh!　Ughhh ......!　It's so thick ......."

"Hmmm, you'll have to remember my shape very well, okay?"

Why does it make me so happy when people say I have a big dick or a thick dick?

Seeing how Eve was suffering, it was obvious that it was not lip service, so I could be honestly pleased.

I move the bra cup of Eve's right breast down a little to expose her breast. Her lovely peach-colored nipple, which had been hidden for a long time, made its first appearance today.

I immediately took the nipple in my mouth and sucked on it while making watery sounds.

With only her right breast exposed and her left breast protected by her underwear, this situation had a similar atmosphere to breastfeeding, which was strangely exciting.

"Agh!"

My penis seems to have swelled even more with the excitement.

Eve's distress at having to endure the thickness of my penis increased, and her breathing became more ragged.

And as if in conjunction with that, her vaginal walls tried to crush my meat stick with tremendous pressure.

"Eve! ......!"

My excitement soared to the top.

I couldn't help but want to make my first ejaculation.

I quickly untied my hands and slipped my hands around her waist, bringing our bodies together.

As soon as I confirmed that I was in a position to plant the seed, my penis rapidly heated up without my intention.

"Guh!　Eve ......!　I'm going to cum......!　Take it!　Eve!"

"Ahh! ......!

Ssss...spurt!　A glob of semen shoots out with great force.

The sight of the young, energetic sperm plunging into Eve's body seemed to penetrate her brain, which was drowning in the pleasure of ejaculation.

The rod seemed to be absorbed in its role of impregnating the girl in front of her, as it repeatedly contracted in small increments and continued to deliver the seed.

Drunk with the intermittent rhythm of my ejaculation, I just kept saying Eve's name.

"Eve...... Eve......!　Huh, Eve ...... ugh ......."

"Gosh, God, you're so ......... ......"

I wondered how long he had been spitting out his seed.

The next thing I knew, my penis was shriveled and squishy.

"Haa...... haa...... Eve......."

I sat up and pulled myself up, and was able to pull my cock out easily.

The genitals were connected to each other by a bridge of fluid, but that too would soon fall off and be gone.

"Huh. ......"

With her legs wide open, Eve lay on her back.

Her bra was disheveled, exposing only her right breast, and her panties were a little loose, and white semen was dripping from her vagina hole.

The way Eve was letting loose in her disheveled underwear was exactly like a girl who had been raped.

In fact, it's almost as if you've raped her, so it's only natural to say that.

"That was good, Eve. ......"

As I kissed down her skin, I thought about the second round.

The night had only just begun.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 157 - White Vessel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are no clocks on the continent of Eruo, and people's activities are determined by the position of the sun.

The light streaming in through the slightly open curtains was like an alarm clock.

The blades of light falling on the dry room seemed to reflect the coldness of winter.

"......Uh......"

I looked next to me and saw Eve asleep, her mouth covered by a blanket.

I'm sure that after the play was over, Eve secretly slept away from me, but it seems that in the middle of the night, she approached me.

I was cold and unconscious, and the heat of the human skin must have lured her.

I kissed Eve's forehead as she slept, making a difficult face with her eyebrows in a figure eight, as if she was being raped by me even in her dreams.

"Hmm~......"

Then Eve's face relaxed and she let out a sound of relief. Then she continues to talk in her sleep, 

"Mom ......."

I think she mistook my kiss for Rave's kiss.

"Hmph~"

Every time I kiss her, Eve smiles and lets out a lovely sleepy sigh.

Her carefree smile was like that of a young child, and it aroused my protective desire. My penis, which had been erect in the morning, faltered slightly.

"I'm going first, Eve."

I said goodbye to the warm blanket and her soft body by calling out to the sleeping Eve.

Unfortunately, I have a lot of work to do, and I can't just start shaking my hips in the morning like a bored college student.

I'd like to have a day where I can hold Eve all day long.

After cleansing my body in the morning bath and finishing my breakfast, I decided to head to the pioneer society.

The purpose of my visit this time was to see the "white plate" that Eve had mentioned.

The pioneer society has a year-end and New Year vacation.

Originally, it was a small group of people who worked under my direction, so when I couldn't see them for a while during the year-end and New Year holidays, we closed all together so that there would be no trouble.

Nowadays, the number of employees has increased and the executives have grown to the point where my absence is no longer a problem, but the custom of long vacations still remains.

As expected, all the employees don't take a vacation at the same time like they did in the past, but they seem to be able to rotate it well.

Since we had informed them yesterday that we were going on an inspection tour, the executives had come to work in spite of the vacation.

While the most senior employees of the pioneering society were all here, there was no one else.

There was no sign of Mimon, so he was probably enjoying his winter vacation with his family. Maybe I can come by later and add to their family.

Along with the executives, there was another person who was not supposed to be in the main building of the pioneer society.

He was the real star of the show.

"Looks like you made it, huh?"

"Heh, heh."

That was the head of the potter who was supposed to be in the production department.

The kiln is far from the production department, so it was nice to hear from the potter himself at the main building. I lightly praised the employees for their good arrangements.

"Now, let's see what they come up with, shall we?"

I thought I had said it in a joking tone to ease the tension, but the room was filled with a tense atmosphere.

I regretted it a little, thinking that it was inevitable that a nobleman would say something like that.

While everyone was silent, the potter's head took a deep breath, clenched his fist and opened his mouth.

His words were small but strong, as if he was proud of his work.

The lumpy, knotty hands of the craftsman laid out the plates and bowls on the table.

The rugged, knotty hands of the craftsman laid out the plates and bowls on the table.

"Oh!"

As I listened to the potter's explanation of the vessels, I picked up one of them, a white plate large enough to hold a piece of toast.

The color was a little different from what I had imagined, but the impression was not bad.

"It's not the same as old-fashioned white, but ...... it's a nice, gentle color. It's a friendly white."

Old pottery, the white vessels that were made in the Holy City more than 200 years ago, is crisp and white. If I were to use an analogy, it would be "hospital white. It has a cool, inorganic, refined color.

On the other hand, this finished dish gives me the impression of "hot milk white. The color is soft and warm with no corners.

When I traced the surface of the plate with my finger, it had the smooth texture of porcelain.

I checked the surface as if I were licking it around, but there were no particular scratches, and the white color was even.

It looked like something you would find in the tableware section of a 100-yen store, and it made me feel a little nostalgic.

It may be considered a high-class white plate by the people living in the continent of Luo, but I think I can use it rather easily.

"...... Mm, this is good. Well done."

The head potter and the rest of the executives exhaled in unison.

The air in the room seemed to relax a little, as if they could tell that I was genuinely satisfied.

"So, how many of these can you make?　How many do you have at the moment?"

If it can be mass-produced, I would like to immediately appeal to it as a new industry in the Quadrant.

In the spring, we will go to the royal capital. I'm sure there will be opportunities to have tea with nobles from all over the country there. ...... No, there definitely will be.

This is the reason why you need to have a white tea utensil. It's a good idea to have a look at the website to get a better idea of what's going on.

If I were to suddenly present a new, white, not old-fashioned, bowl to the tea party, they would be somewhat surprised.

It is said that my father's diplomacy is to disrupt the pace of the other party and then turn on the poison.

"That's ......."

One of the employees began to explain about the production situation with a scowl on his face.

According to him, there are still a lot of failures, and they are still trying to find a stable way to produce a large number of pieces. They don't have enough kilns to start with, so mass production is difficult at present.

"I see. I see. It's not that easy."

The land for the production department must have been quite cramped, so it would be difficult to build more kilns.

It might be better to ask my father to give me a piece of land somewhere.

In the meantime, I've instructed him to make a set of tea sets first. If we can ignore the number of failures, it is possible to make the tea set itself, so I want to get it ready as soon as possible.

"...... And make sure you bring one set of plates and bowls to the castle. I will present them to my father."

"Very well, sir."

Since I can't just ask for land out of the blue, I'll show you the results first and then tell you what I want.

After giving detailed instructions on how to use the rest of the vessels, I decided to ask the last thing that was on my mind.

"What did you end up with?"

I had seen a question on a Japanese quiz show in a previous life: "This coffee cup is made of the bones of a certain animal, what animal is it? I had seen a question on .......

The answer was a cow.

This project started with a hint of that memory from a previous life, but I couldn't get it right, probably because the quality of cows is different between Earth and the continent of Eruo.

I don't even know if they are really the same cows as on Earth, because I just call them cows because they look like cows.

So for the past few years, the potters have been experimenting endlessly by combining animal bones with various types of clay from the territory of Quardenze and firing them.

As the president of the company, he wanted to know the identity of the bones because he had spent a huge amount of money on the research.

"It's a thick-haired rabbit."

The potters had tried unsuccessfully to use the bones of various animals such as horses, boars, and bears, and one day, out of desperation, they used the scraps of a thick-haired rabbit they had eaten as a material.

Of course, this did not produce a perfect product out of the blue, but it did produce a slightly better result than the others.

So he focused on the bones of the thick-haired rabbit, and after a lot of trial and error, changing the clay and devising a new kiln, he was finally able to produce something he was satisfied with.


"I see. We have to be careful about information leaking out."

Although it was unlikely that the product would be immediately produced just because the material was discovered, there was no better way than to be cautious.

We can't afford to let other territories take over our new industry, or we won't be able to recover our investment.

We have to be more careful about information management.

It may be fortunate that the material was not beef but thick-haired rabbit bones. It's not so unnatural to purchase them in large quantities.

I think it's more of a labor issue than a food culture ...... issue on the continent of Luo, but the commoners don't eat much beef.

Cows are expected to serve as agricultural tractors, not meat. It's not that beef is forbidden, though, so they eat it when they have the chance.

If they were stocking a large amount of cattle, which they are not supposed to eat, one might think that there is something wrong with them.　Some of us might wonder if something is going on.

On the other hand, the thick-haired rabbit is a livestock that even commoners have many chances to eat, so it is easy to collect bones. The employee who said he was glad it wasn't a cow was right.

But basically, rabbits are livestock that farmers raise while they work, and there are few farmers who specialize in raising rabbits. There are very few farmers who specialize in thick-haired rabbits, and even if there were, the scale of their operations is limited.

It might be a good idea to set up a dedicated ...... facility.

If the sale of the white vessels takes off, it will eventually become difficult to obtain the bones. We may need to take action sooner rather than later.

The hair becomes thread, the meat is delicious, the feces is fertilizer for the fields, and the bones become vessels. It doesn't matter how many thick-haired rabbits we have, we can use all of them.

It would be interesting to build a facility like a huge poultry farm and start raising a large number of thick-haired rabbits.

"Um, the land is ......."

As I listened to the apologetic voice of the employee, I was thinking about how to beg my father.

After receiving the report from the pioneer society, I finished the morning with some light work that had accumulated.　

I decided to return to New Nellie Castle in the afternoon and had lunch at the villa before heading out into the city.

The restless atmosphere at the end of the year was the same in the city as in the castle, but there seemed to be many smiling faces on the streets.

"It's lively."

"Yes, it is. It's almost the New Year."

Minith, walking diagonally behind me on the right, replies to my words.

She had some business to attend to at the castle today, so I invited her to come back with me.

The New Year's Festival is the most anticipated event of the year for those who live in the castle. Everyone is looking forward to the knight's arrival.

"Is that so?"

Minith said that the New Year's celebration in New Nellie City starts at the same time the knights from all over the country arrive, so the commoners in the castle are waiting anxiously for the knights to arrive.

The children go to play near the castle gates at this time of year and look out at the city with greedy faces.

When they see a group of knights in the distance, they race home together. When we see a procession of knights in the distance, we race home, thinking that the festival will start soon. They would brag about it to their mother and father as if it was their own achievement.

Minith squinted as if looking into the distance, and said in a slightly melancholy tone.

Incidentally, except for New Nellie City, all cities in the Quardenze hold their New Year's festivals in February.

It is held when the knights return from New Nellie City. There was no way they could start the festival without the knights.

It is said that some vendors stay in New Nellie City in January and then move to major cities such as Gatoren to accompany the knights to the New Year's Festival.

Every year at the end of the New Year's Festival, the boys of New Nellie City always say, "I want to be a peddler in the future. Minith's brother had once said something like that, too.

"So, you know."

Minith's voice was bouncy as she talked about her memories of the New Year's Festival. I could hear that she was very happy to be able to talk to me.

I could almost picture my dog jumping on me with his tail wagging and wagging when I returned from my trip.

He keeps a certain distance from me because the baby gets jealous ......, but it is interesting to notice that he comes so close to me that the backs of his hands almost touch each other.

"I've heard that the young master has prepared an event this year, and everyone is looking forward to it."

"Oh?　What are you going to participate in?"

The role of the Quardenze family at the New Year's celebration in New Nelly was simply to serve food and drink.

Basically, they said, "Let the citizens make their own noise. We'll give them a little food and drink," was their stance.

But since the citizens were having a good time, I wanted to get involved in some way.

"A millionaire, that's what my brother likes to do."

So I planned a card game.

The pioneer society also made playing cards, so only those who bought them could participate in the card tournament organized by Quardenze Wilk.

There are several events, such as millionaire, seven-sided card game, neurasthenia, baba-rufu, etc., and the winner will receive a gold envelope directly from me.

It seems that wealthy people and merchants who want gain my recognition, the heir to the Quardenze family, are desperately buying up playing cards.

If we were to do such a thing on the scale of New Nellie City, the number of people who would participate would be outrageous and it would be impossible to control, but since playing cards are reasonably expensive, the number of participants should not be that large.

However, since playing cards are reasonably expensive, the number of participants should not be that large. Playing cards made by pioneer societies are not affordable for ordinary people. They are not unaffordable, but they are expensive enough to make you hesitate to buy them.

As for why Minith's brother has such an expensive toy, I heard that when Minith's entry into the villa was officially confirmed, money and goods were presented to his parents' house, and I think that playing cards were among them.

"The playing cards were also made by Young Master, weren't they?"

"Yes. I wonder how many years ago it was ......."

In Eruo continent, there were several entertainment games that the nobles enjoyed, such as chess-like board games, but there were no games like playing cards. At least, not in the Quardenze territory.

The reason why I decided to make playing cards and spread them throughout the continent of Eruo was quite simple. It was a publicity stunt.

Only the wealthy, knights, and noblemen can enjoy playing games without a care in the world. In other words, the spread of playing cards would spread the name of Quardenze Wilk to those people.

The plan was to increase his fame throughout the continent and become the next de facto head of the family.

However, such a naive plan soon turned out to be a dead end.

If you want to make a normal playing card as people on Earth imagine, you need smooth and thin paper. However, New Nellie City did not have the technology to make such paper.

Thus, my playing card making turned into paper making, and my budget for research was rapidly disappearing.

When I succeeded in making paper prototypes after spending a lot of money, I hired a good painter to draw on them, and as a result, I ended up with something that could more accurately be called a magical tool or a work of art than a game product.

When I wanted to use it to play bubba with Fanny, she refused, saying, "It's not good to play with art."

I wanted to have a good time with my cute sister, so I decided to leave the paper alone and focus on making something that looked like playing cards.

What I ended up with was a playing card made of animal tusks.

It looks completely like a mahjong tile. It could be said that the design of the mahjong tile was simply replaced by the design of a playing card.

When I showed the completed playing card tiles to Fanny, she responded well, and I was able to pull off my long awaited Bubba Draw.

There are many craftsmen in New Nellie City, and it is relatively easy to process tusks, so it was rather easy to make a prototype. What was all the trouble up to that point?

Realizing that there was no need to stick to paper, I decided to commercialize the playing card tiles as they were.

At first, I was troubled by the lack of sales, but recently, I've heard that sales have been increasing little by little, and we've been wobbling around the break-even point.

As such, the playing card tiles are the original playing cards on the continent of Eruo.

Sometimes my father, mother, Fanny, and I play cards together, and I think we probably look like a mahjong family to people on Earth.

In Eruo, where there is no concept of intellectual property rights, pirated playing cards will probably become popular without my knowledge, but that's okay. I've already anticipated this.

In fact, since I'm expecting the appearance of counterfeit products, I've deliberately written the common standard for playing card tiles on the box.

The back of the box must include the sentence, "Playing card tiles invented by Quardenze Wilk," as a standard, and I'm sure that disciplined copyists will copy that sentence as well.

It's a nice protocol to spread my name even if it's not playing cards made by a pioneer society.

While I was telling Minith the story behind the development of the playing cards, we arrived at the castle.

I visited my father after receiving a white dish that had arrived in the inspection room, probably delivered by the employees in a dash.

"This is ......, and this is the finished dish."

"This is ......."

I lined up the old white plate from my collection room and the white plate made by the pioneer society.

"This is the first time I've ever seen such a thing. Can you mass produce it?"

My father's eyes were glued to the plate, and he did not look at me.

It seemed that I had won his favor.

"No, we've only just begun to produce products of this quality, so the numbers are still small. The production department is getting smaller and we can't secure enough kilns."

"Is ...... not enough?"

I nodded my head, assuming he was referring to the land.

The fact that my father is asking me means that he is planning to make accommodations.

"I see. If it's that land, ...... no, ummm ......."

I could tell by the way my father's head was twisting that he had a good opinion of the white plate, but I wanted to make sure I heard him right.

"What do you think of the bowl, father?"

My father seemed to notice that he hadn't told him what he thought of it.

He gave a small cough and smiled.

"It's really wonderful. I'm proud that such a beautiful vessel was born from the land of Quardenze."

Today, pottery from Mamshred is highly prized in the Leviathan and Zinkhaen empires, as it has replaced the old pottery techniques that were lost.

The main characteristic of Mamshred ceramics is the high level of painting.

"I have a few Mamshred platters myself, and even the untrained eye can see the quality of the intricately painted flowers and plants on them."

I had read in the past that the Mamshred region is so polluted by magical beast disasters that there is no room to choose the best clay for making ceramics.

As a result of trying to add value to the pottery by painting on it, rather than pursuing the quality of the pottery itself with poor quality clay, the pottery technology of Mamshred may have evolved in a different direction from that of old pottery.

Although the high level of technical skill is evident in Mamshred ceramics, surprisingly, they are not as popular as old-fashioned ceramics.

This is a matter of values. The aristocracy of the Luo continent prefers clean vessels with no paintings on them.

The raw material for ceramics is soil, and soil is the earth.

I believe that the aristocrats see their values, justice, principles, beliefs, and creed in the white vessels.

"I'll think about the land."

"Thank you."

The way my father proudly gazed at the white vessel, I could consider my plea a success.

Later, I'll send a document full of requests to my father's civil servant.

After all, my father seemed to be interested in pottery, and he kept asking me detailed questions about raw materials and manufacturing methods.

After we had talked for a while, my father moved his arm and pointed to an old pottery on his desk for comparison.

He moved as if to say, "I'm going to change the subject now."

At the same time I was paying attention to his fingertips, my father slowly opened his mouth.

"What do you think happened to the old pottery that came into New Nellie?"

Chapter 158 - Nobles and Priests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Looking up from the window, I saw a large white moon floating in the night sky as if ink had been spilled on it.

My eyes, used to the color of candlelight, were slightly dazzled.

I stretched out my arm toward the moon and laid my palm on top of it, but I could not completely cover its appearance.

If I had done the same thing on Earth, I would have been able to hide it with just my thumb, but the moon in this world is much bigger.

The moon ring, which still gives me a sense of discomfort, reminds me once again that I have come to a distant world, and combined with the cold winter air, I feel a little faint.

On nights like this, I wish I could sleep with something warm and soft in my arms. For example, a woman's body.

As I warmed the air around me with my magic, I lowered my gaze from the sky to the city.

Most of the citizens had probably finished their activities by now, and the lights in the city were sparse and seemed like they would disappear at any moment.

"Young Master."

As I sipped my hot tea and looked down on the city, I heard a man's voice from behind the door.

I responded with an inarticulate snarl, as I stood in a daze with one foot on the window sill looking out into the dark night.

"I'm here with you. May I enter the room?"

It seemed that someone was waiting for me. I hardened my expression as if I were a legitimate son of the Quardenze family and moved away from the window.

I sat down in my chair with plenty of time to spare and gave permission to enter through the door.

"Excuse me, sir."

The first person to enter the room was a military officer who was rarely seen.

As soon as he entered the room, he assumed a flowing, graceful posture of bowing. His movements were supple and without the lumbering feeling characteristic of military officers.

"......, do you usually work at the museum?"

"Yes sir!"

The military officer replied to my question with his posture straightened.

On the outskirts of New Nelly City, there was a building that was simply called "The Pavilion".

The roof of the building had the aggressive look of a spear piercing the heavens, and the walls, blacker than night, were overbearing.

The wide moat that had been set up around the castle to prevent bandits from entering was wide, and the surface of the water glittered in the moonlight when viewed from a distance through the windows.

"I see, it's quite a sight."

The role of the museum was to be a prisoner of war camp.

The Quardenze family had expanded their territory to the west, and naturally, there was a noble family that was the ruler there.

These noble families belonged to the Zinkhaen Empire and the former Voistra faction.

As a result of the incessant trampling of these noble families, female nobles and daughters of knightly families were gathered in the mansion.

The mansion was originally a guest house for visiting nobles from other territories, but as the number of noble captives increased, it was renovated and turned into a prison camp.

It is said that male noblemen and knights have little value in captivity and are rather dangerous to keep on hand, so if there is a chance to capture them, they are killed.

According to my father, capturing noblewomen is delicious.

Of course, he didn't mean in the lower half of the body, but in the political and diplomatic sense.

For example, what would happen if he could take a female noblewoman who came to the destroyed noble family as a wife as a prisoner?

In this case, the Quardenze family could use blackmail diplomacy against the family of the captive.

They can ask for money in exchange for the captive, or force the captive to stop hostile actions against the family.

My father said that there was no better card to play in terms of immediate benefits.

Other times, he would take the princess of a noble family that he had destroyed into captivity.

However, the use of captive princesses is limited. In most cases, the princess can only be retrieved after the game has been decided and the house has been destroyed. There was no one to whom I could demand compensation.

No one can complain about the treatment of a princess of a defunct noble family in a prisoner of war camp, and there is no way to know about it. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the future of the captive princess would be very bleak.

Because even if she rots, she is still a snapper, and even if her family is destroyed, she is still the main ancestor. If a commoner raped a captive princess, the child would be a subordinate ancestor with magical powers.

Unlike the sexually sensitive male nobles, the female nobles only need to sleep with their legs spread apart for the time being, so they can be sure to get a cousin, albeit at a rate of about one per year.

After the birth of the child, she would be separated from her mother, the captive princess, and educated to become a member of the Quardenze family.

But now, there is also the option of selling her to a nobleman from another territory.

The number of ancestors has been decreasing due to the strange disease caused by the magical beast Yersinia, and the noble families with a shortage of children would want the princesses of the ancestors as much as they can.

As long as she is a princess of a noble family that has already died, they will not complain even if you treat her roughly, so you can handle her with ease.

The captive princess would be sold as a class change from a cousin-making machine to a main ancestor-making machine.

Sometimes my father invites male nobles from other territories to New Nellie City, and I think he's letting them inspect the captives to see if there's a princess they like. If there's anything that strikes a chord with their dicks, they'll buy it.

If this deal goes well, the Quardenze family will not only be able to ingratiate themselves with the other families, but they will also be able to gain a tremendous amount of money and be able to conduct espionage more easily.

In the case of selling the captive princess to another family, it is not possible to send her off as a single item. There is a possibility of leaving a bad taste in the future.

It is not uncommon for noble men to be partial to the women they love. It is possible that the captive princess, still holding a grudge, will one day seduce the nobleman to whom she will be sold and turn against the Quardenze family.

So, what to do is to send a servant of the Quardenze family along with the POW Princess as her caretaker.

The servants are expected to monitor and brainwash the captive princess, and at the same time act as spies to investigate and report on the internal affairs of other families.

Brainwashing is not a very difficult thing to do. The only person who can take care of the anxious mind of the captive princess, who has become the property of an unknown man in an unknown land, is a servant sent by the Quardenze family. It was not surprising that the young princess became dependent on the servant.

In this way, the captive princess is gradually brainwashed and no longer harbors any ill feelings.

If all goes well, the captive princess will become a dutiful princess of the Quardenze family, and will eventually give birth to the heir of another family. If we consider the cost and performance alone, it will be more profitable than marrying off our own daughter.

"Here is the latest report."

I picked up the report that the military officer had presented to me and skimmed over it.

The person we were waiting for today, Cynthia, a priest of the Zeth Order of the Holy High Priestess, had been detained by the military and transferred to a mansion to live under house arrest.

It is difficult to restrain a person with magic power.

The best way is to seal them with a magical seal that prevents them from using magic, but you need people with magical power to perform this procedure, and you never know when the seal will be broken.

However, it would require people with magical power to do this, and there was no telling when the seal would be broken.

However, if the captive was the cousin, it was still good. Since there are a lot of cousins in the army, it would not be easy for them to escape.

The problem was that the main ancestors, the female nobles, were the captives. If they wanted to, they would be no match for a bunch of knights.

The main ancestor has a lot of magic power, so it is impossible for the subordinate ancestor to seal the magic, only the family members of the Quardenze family, who are also the main ancestor, can do it.

Even if the magic was sealed, the captives of the main ancestor would be like time bombs, not knowing when the seal would be broken.

In order to restrain them, the mansion has been completely remodeled with stone that repels magic.

However, the captive princesses, who have no home to return to, rarely act violently and are said to be good little girls most of the time.

The prison is spacious, she is well fed, and on sunny days she is allowed to go out in the garden with the help of a military officer, so I heard that she is living a good life.

I had heard that military officers who have been working at the palace for a long time tend to be more soft-spoken because they have a chance to talk with the captive princesses.

Even the princesses of defunct noble families have a sense of reverence for their ancestors.

"As per Young Master's order, we have not conducted any unreasonable interrogation."

The contents of the report were not that different from what I had received so far, and I was able to finish reading it immediately.

"I see."

The report was a summary of the indiscriminate attack plan by the head of the Holy High Church in New Nelly City, as well as matters related to Cynthia's origins.

I had given strict orders to Cynthia not to be tortured or interrogated, since she had shown her willingness to cooperate with the Quardenze family.

I don't have a hobby of torturing women to the point of getting a boner for their tortured bodies.

"It's all well and good. I'd like to hear what you have to say."

It was I, of all people, who sent a message to Cynthia, the priestess of the Zesu Church of the Holy High Society, who had wandered into New Nelly, to come to New Nelly Castle this evening.

At any rate, I wanted to talk to her rather than read the report.

"Very well, sir."

The military officer left the room and came right back. He was accompanied by Cynthia, whose front and back were flanked by soldiers.

He was dressed not in monastic garb but in ordinary clothes worn by commoners, probably supplied by the Quardenze family.

Her long, cherry-red hair that brushed her hips and her red eyes gave her a warm impression.

And then I noticed her breasts, which had grown to the point where the cloth was puffed up. They look really heavy.

When Cynthia spotted me, she looked surprised and took a stance that meant she wanted to introduce herself.

I arranged the guards and military officers in a corner of the room, then turned to look at Cynthia.

"I allow."

When I gave my permission, Cynthia began to tell me her name and where she was from with a priestly bow.

Cynthia is a low-ranking priest at St. Navenpos, the head temple of the Holy High Society of Zes. That was Cynthia's true identity.

When the military officer asked her about her origins after she was transferred to the palace, she replied, "I'm from St. Navenpos," as if she were trying to sell him a fire extinguisher.

On the continent of Eruo, borders are not strictly controlled as they were in the previous Earth. If anything, the walls that surround the cities play a role.

Therefore, Cynthia was able to enter the territory of Quardenze without any particular difficulty.

The founder of the Zeth religion traveled all over the continent, so it is considered good for his followers to travel as well.

Despite being a noble family belonging to the Kingdom of Levios, the Holy High Church still exists in New Nelly City, so devout believers occasionally make pilgrimages there. It seems that Cynthia was thought to be one of them, and it was not so difficult for her to enter the city.

"Thank you very much for your kind attention."

Facing each other at the desk, Cynthia and I exchanged greetings with the usual politeness.

Her manners were impeccable and she understood her position as a woman of low rank in an audience with a nobleman.

...... You seem to have a sense of propriety. It's not surprising that a priest of St. Navenpos ...... would be under the command of a holy priestess.

So I decided to cut right to the chase.

The holy priestess is a rank that exists as a symbol of faith in the Zesian high society.

The role of the shaman is to reign supreme at important ceremonies, rituals, and festivals, and to act as a mediator between humans and spirits.

According to tradition, the granddaughter of the founder, Zeth, was the first to attain this rank.

Perhaps because of this, the rank was limited to the daughters of the famous family of St. Navenpos, who were said to have inherited the bloodline of the founder, Zeth.

Cynthia was said to have been a priestess in the holy city as one of the holy priest's subordinates.

Cynthia is the embodiment of the Zesu religion, but if you look at history, she is also the one who triggered the decline of the Holy High Priestess Association, which was once a prosperous and powerful organization.

In the past, the Holy High Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operated under a system similar to a two-headed government. The Pope was the head of the organization and the Holy Priest was the head of the faith.

The Pope was the supreme authority of the Holy High Church, but he was not the head of religion.

The election of the Pope has always been a bloody power struggle, and the most intense was the uprising 200 years ago.

This time, the supreme priest, his supporters, and the holy priestess, who had not been elected pope, teamed up.

As the head of the organization and the head of the faith fought it out, the power struggle within the Holy High Priestly Association became a quagmire, the prestige of the Holy High Priestly Association of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that had covered the entire continent faded, and the turbulent times spread, eventually leading to the rise of the nobility.

After many twists and turns, the upheaval finally came to an end when the authority of the priests was burnt to ashes.

Ironically, as the priests lost their power due to the rise of the nobility, the organization dwarfed them and the scale of the conflict decreased. It might be more accurate to say that the two sides collapsed together rather than settled.

The priests who remained in the deserted holy city stripped all power from the rank of holy priest, which had been the cause of the prolonged conflict.

What was considered to be the authority of the holy priest could no longer be exercised without the approval of the highest priests, leaving only the role of a symbol of faith.

Rumor has it that the holy priestesses are chosen from among the daughters of famous families based solely on their character and good looks.

Very interesting.

I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

If there's anything I can do, anything at all.

I'm not going to ask you to pinch my cock with your big tits for now.

Maintaining the expression of a legitimate son of the Quardenze family, I instructed the servants to serve tea to Cynthia as well.

I asked him to pour me another cup, and we both sipped the tea.

"It smells wonderful.

"I'm glad you like it."

As I looked at Cynthia's chest, enjoying the fragrance of the tea, I thought about it.

The reason I called Cynthia this time was not for her milk, but for my father.

My father has been diplomatically dealing with noblemen with their own peculiarities, but he has rarely dealt with priests.

In a sense, it was no surprise that when my father was born, the Society of the Holy High Priest of Zeth had already fallen into decline and disappeared from the stage of history. There was no problem in ignoring it.

My father had to deal with the sudden appearance of the holy priest's subordinates by hand.

And he wanted to hear my opinion.

I can't deny that I was a little excited, because I never expected my father to ask me for help in diplomacy.

That's the reason why I immediately called Cynthia.

I was impressed by how knowledgeable the priest was when I heard about him earlier, but I didn't expect him to come from the Holy City.

"No, I'm still in training."

"How is life in New Nelly City compared to Holy City?"

When she stared at me, I felt like I was reaching for her breasts, so I asked her a safe question.

Her breasts are huge, by the way. She was wearing loose clothing, but her breasts stuck out like they were going to pop out, making her look fat at first glance.

If you look at her wrists, neck and face, you can see that she is not skinny, but she is smart enough. It's like the big tits tax.

"It's a great, vibrant city. This is because of the good administration of the Quardenze family."

"How?　Good government?"

"Yes. It is very wonderful that the teachings of the spirits have not been lost despite being in the Kingdom of Levios. The people will be able to spend their days in peace. I'm sure the spirits will bless the Quardenze family for not being involved in the invasion of the Misty Lands."

I thought it was just a sycophantic remark to the heir of a noble family, but it seemed to be Cynthia's true intention.

In short, the management of the territory in accordance with the wishes of the Holy High Church is wonderful.

"In the land of mist?　...... Come to think of it, the Holy High Church has made such a statement. I don't understand why they're saying that."

The Holy High Society of the Zeth Order makes statements from time to time to the commoners living in the Kingdom of Levios and the Zinkhaen Empire.

They say that rule by nobles is wrong, that the Levios family who oppress priests should die, and that territories that destroy churches will be destroyed.

One of the standard phrases was that nobles should not enter the Land of Mists.

Of course, the anti-Holy High Priest's family, the Leviathans, ignored this, and rather than saying, "You told me not to, so I'm going to do the opposite!" In fact, they went on an expedition to the Land of Mists with great enthusiasm.

It should be noted that the reason why the Quardenze do not set foot in the Land of Mists is because they are geographically unable to go northward, not because they are lending an ear to the advice of the Holy High Society.

I understood the complaints about the domination of the nobles, the suppression of the priests, and the destruction of the church, but I didn't understand why they were complaining about the entry into the land of mist.

I asked her why, but Cynthia didn't seem to know the reason in detail and just shook her head vaguely.

I was told that it was because the higher-ups of the Holy High Society said it was not allowed.

"......, but nobles are not allowed to touch the Land of Mist. I've heard that in the worst case scenario, the entire continent could be covered in unholy soil."

If the entire continent was covered in unholy soil, soil contaminated by maturing demonic beasts, it would be synonymous with the destruction of the people of the continent.

Although it was an exaggerated statement, there must be something about the Misty Land that the Holy High Society could not compromise.

The founder, Zess, has traveled all over the continent, including the Misty Land. Perhaps there is some secret in the documents left behind by the Seitaka.

"I'd like to know more about the contents of the scriptures. I'd love to hear the opinion of a priest who studied at St. Navenpos about the contents of the scriptures."

"Thank you." Cynthia smiled.

She seemed genuinely pleased that the nobleman was interested in the scriptures.

In the scriptures, there was a sentence that said something like, "The Patriarch must protect the earth. ......"

"Then said the Field of White Snow. The Lord among men must protect Eruo. "Then the field of white snow said, 'The principal among men must protect Eruo, or you will stone the wheat that now bears fruit. ...... Are you referring to Part 8, Chapter 73, Verse 12 of the Pure Scripture?"

"Yes, perhaps it is."

"It is said that the field of white snow is identical to the Tiamesarail, the spirit of the snow field in the Holy Scriptures. She is a member of the family of the Great Spirit of Earth, Harfaneal, and is the interpretation of the text of verse 12. ......"

It seems that she had studied something like theology in the Holy City in her previous life on Earth.

As soon as I mentioned the scriptures, her cherry-red eyes would shine and she would start talking about religion before I could stop her.

It was interesting to hear a professional preach, but that was not what I wanted to hear.

It's not that I don't want to hear about it.

"The teachings of the ...... Spirit of the Snowfield are naturally respected in the Seikoukai, right?"

After confirming that Cynthia nodded, I continued.

"If that's the case, I want to hear it. Is it permissible to defile the earth in order to reclaim the faith from the tyranny of the nobles?"

Cynthia stopped twitching, but I silenced her with an appeal with my eyes that I still had something to say.

This time, I had called her to ask this question.

"I think you heard during the interrogation that that woman Deanna and the head of the church here in New Nellie City had teamed up and were planning something. And I believe that it was a plan to create a mature magical beast to disrupt the Quardenze territory."

Mature demonic beasts don't occur in such a timely manner on the scale of New Nellie Field. It's natural to think that there's some kind of connection between the church leader's plan and the outbreak of mature demonic beasts.

Considering the babies found inside the field, the living space, and Lupetta's story, a plan to mature  demonic beasts by sacrificing the main ancestor and the cousin emerged. However, the idea that the growth of a demonic beasts can be advanced by eating a magical being is currently only a hypothesis.

It is said that the literary officials of the Quardenze family have read every piece of literature related to demonic beasts in New Nellie Castle, but they were unable to find anything to support it. I've also tried to unravel the books in my spare time, but the result was the same.

There is a lack of literature in the Quardenze family. But the Holy High Society is different.

If you include the predecessor organization of the Holy High Society of Zeth, it has been in Saint Navenpos since ancient times, over a thousand years. It has a history not shared by the noble families of the Kingdom of Levios or the Zinkhaen Empire. I'm sure they have a thing or two of knowledge that they can't reveal too openly.

"It's ...... Sorry, I'm not aware of that."

And that information has already been heard by civilian and military officials.

Cynthia apologized to me in a sincerely apologetic tone and bent forward. The way her breasts, which were pressed against the desk, squirmed and moved was quite a sight to behold.

"I'm not going to ask you if that prediction is correct. You don't know, do you?"

"No."

The report said that Cynthia was trained purely as a priest, so she was not that familiar with knowledge related to magical beasts.

I don't trust Cynthia all the way, but I don't see the point in torturing her to find out.

If you really want to know, the best way is to feed your ancestor to a magical beast under the supervision of the military.

The three followers of Diana, who were thought to be the ringleaders, were just ragtag mercenaries who were scheduled to be executed. If you're going to kill them anyway, you may as well use them effectively in that direction.

It would have been best if we could have gotten Diana to tell us the whole truth about her plan, but she immediately committed suicide as soon as she realized that she would be tortured by the Quardenze army. He was the epitome of a terrorist.

What I want to ask is the first part. "What I want to ask you is the first part, is it permissible to go against the teachings of the scriptures and spread filth?"

It was not sarcasm. It's just pure curiosity.

Cynthia made a little gesture of consideration and then opened her mouth, stroking her hair with her hand.

"It is a solution that should be avoided, but it is not against the teachings of the scriptures. ...... No, it is allowed to go against it."

"Huh, ......?"

I was expecting to hear the priest's defense, but Cynthia answered firmly.

"With all due respect, Master Wilk, have you ever had a priest teach you the scriptures?"

"I've read a whole bunch of scriptures, but this is entirely a hobby, and I didn't invite a priest to tutor me."

I'm not so much a child as I am ashamed of what I don't know, so I answered honestly that I didn't have any.

"If that's the case, let's start with a brief talk about the scriptures."

Cynthia spoke to me in a soft tone, like a teacher teaching a child.

As if she had the scriptures in her head, she recited the part she needed without hesitation and continued to explain it.

Her confident tone seemed to show how far she had come in her sincere approach to the scriptures.

She continued to talk about the scriptures for a while, but they all had one thing in common. She continued to talk about the scriptures for a while, but they all had one thing in common: they explained the fundamental idea of the doctrine of Zeth.

It was the part that explained the fundamental ideas of Zesu doctrine, such as living together in harmony, not hurting others, and doing things that benefit others.

It's like a program provision in the Japanese Constitution. ...... To name a few. Defiling the earth with dirt is of course against these teachings.

Of course it is.

Terrorism, such as unleashing a mature demonic beasts, hurts people and is not good for them. It is only natural that it goes against the general doctrine.

It's only natural that it goes against the general doctrine. "Besides, you have the words of the Spirit of the Snowfield. Isn't that doubly contrary to the teachings of the scriptures?"

Cynthia, however, categorically rejected my continued opinion.

"Master Wilk has not been trained by a priest, so it cannot be helped, but it is a misinterpretation. The words of Tiamessa Rail, the spirit of the snowfield, are: 'The principal among men must protect Eruo' .......

"The principal among men is the Patriarch, right?"

"Yes. Yes, that's fine with me. Then, what about the rest of the words, "Protect Eruo"? What is Eruo? What do you think, Master Wilk?"

"You mean the earth, don't you?　The land on which the people live."

"That's what I've been taught, and I'm sure I'm right."

But Cynthia must have expected that answer, because she shook her head softly without any sign of surprise.

"In the empire and the kingdom, it seems to be treated as synonymous with 'earth,' but this is a misinterpretation and not correct."

My image of the word is that it is similar to "the land where people live," but apparently it is so difficult that there are many theories about it in the Seikoukai.

In addition, among the nobility, "Eruo = earth" is a completely established theory ...... or rather a definite matter.

Cynthia's face darkened a little as she muttered to me, "I'm not sure if the Holy High Church has a different interpretation.

"In the Kingdom of Levios, correct teachings are being lost and correct beliefs are disappearing,....... And there is no one who can correct it. ...... How horrible it is. ...... The holy priestess was right after all: ......"

I'm sorry to say that Cynthia is grieving in a tone of voice that sounds like she's about to cry, but I've decided to return to the subject at hand.

"It's a difference in interpretation of the word "Eruo". So, what does it mean in the Seikoukai?"

"I'll simplify it for you: Eruo means the ideal land. It is a world where people coexist under the protection of correct faith. In other words."

"So you're saying that a land under the control of noblemen is not an Eruo to be protected?

"...... Yes."

I don't know what it is, but it sounds like the most convenient interpretation for priests. Well, I guess it's only natural that it's the Holy High Society that interprets it.

"I'm sure you understand the true meaning of the words of Tiamessa Rail, the spirit of the snowfield."

"Hmm, ....... It's not about protecting the earth, it's about overthrowing the nobility.

I'm not sure what to make of that.

It seems that it is still awkward to tell a nobleman to overthrow a nobleman.

It's a good thing that she's a priest, because she's going to tell you the truth instead of playing games to please the nobility.

And a strong word from a spirit takes precedence over a weak word.

Weak words are words like, "Let's all get along," or "Don't hurt people.

When there are stronger instructions, it's okay to meditate a little on the sketchier teachings.

I guess this is similar to the principle of longest match. I think this is a safe way to interpret conflicting doctrines.

It's an approach that should be avoided, but I guess that's what they mean by not going against the scriptures.

As a believer, it is always better not to ignore even weak words.

But if the cause is to protect the strong words, it means that it is not absolute.

"In other words, if there is a priest who takes the words of Tiamesarail, the spirit of the snowfield, as his cause, then he is allowed to terrorize the nobles with magical beasts."

"However, I do not believe that any action that defiles the earth for any reason is the right one. Even if the words are weak, they are the words of a spirit. It should never be disregarded. I'm sure the shaman feels the same way. Therefore, ......"

Cynthia adds, as if remembering that the Holy High Society is not a terrorist organization.

Certainly, if the story ends here, it will end up being a priest who fought against the nobles.

I paused to accept Cynthia's words, and then returned to the topic of priests who condone terrorism.

"But it doesn't seem to make sense to turn the land into dirt to fight the nobles. But it seems to me that there is no point in turning the land into dirt to fight against the nobles, as there will be no faith in a polluted land."

"If the pollution is mild, it will be naturally cleansed in a few years, but if it is severe, or if it is repeatedly contaminated as if it were painted over, it will not be cleansed for tens or hundreds of years."

"If we go down the terrorist route badly, the next generation is going to have a very hard time."

"It is conceivable that once we get ...... Eruo back, the miracle will be restored."

Oh, miracles.

The Zesu Church of the Holy High Society, like most religions, has its own miracle stories.

There are many episodes in the scriptures about how the earth was cleansed and transformed into an ear of wheat just by walking on it. I only believe half the stories.

"Do you think that the priests of the Church of the Holy High Priestesses can purify the earth with miraculous power even if they get it covered in dirt?"

"With the right faith, you will surely be guided by the spirits."

I tried to say it sarcastically, but it was returned normally.

It seems that Cynthia really believes in miracles.

If that's the case, then the fact that St. Navenpos's dirt has been left untouched proves that faith has been lost. ......

In St. Navenpos, there are still traces of turmoil and unholy soil all over the territory.

If the Holy High Society was a religion full of faith, it would have been a miracle if it hadn't disappeared long ago.　

I thought I had said it back, but Cynthia nodded her head in agreement.

"Yes. The holy priestess also lamented this point. It is because the priests have lost faith that miracles have been lost in the Holy City. Yes, now is the time to regain the correct faith. We must recreate St. Navenpos by relying on the spirits and bring miracles to the continent again. This is our mission as students of the founder Zeth. ......!　Warthento-sama, Great Spirit of the Sun, please show us your faith."

Cynthia got really excited, and I just gave her a few words.

Compared to the congregation and priests at the Holy High Church in New Nellie City, the priests at the real place are very conscious.

I was impressed by her swaying breasts as she sang a hymn of praise and talked about her idealistic dream.

Still, when I talked to her in person, I felt that there was a big difference between the values of a nobleman and a priest.

The aristocrats seem to be more concerned about being the guardians of the earth, while the priests seem to be less concerned about it.

However, when I think about it, I think that only the spirits of the snowfield directly say "Let's protect the earth" in the scriptures.

And even then, depending on the interpretation of the scriptures, it could quickly turn into an order to eliminate the nobles, so there was nothing I could do about it.

I can understand why my father, a genuine nobleman, was not confident when he heard the results of Cynthia's interrogation.

Unlike me, who had known a time on Earth filled with a diversity of values, my father had only known an aristocratic society that was in a sense closed-minded, and Cynthia was a foreign body to him.

I guess he instinctively feels uneasy when he meets someone whose common sense he thinks is unacceptable.

"Nobles and priests: ......"

Originally, the relationship between nobles and priests was like that between central bureaucrats and local officials.

The priests from the central government of St. Navenpos indirectly ruled the land by subordinating the nobles who were the native lords.

In addition to the overwhelming military power of the Holy Army, the nobles also benefited from the rich economic power and advanced culture of the priests of St. Navenpos.

However, the uprising in St. Navenpos led to a great upheaval in the continent.

From the priest's point of view, it doesn't matter how much the territory he is sent to is destroyed, but for the nobles, it is a matter of life and death. They would not tolerate the destruction of their own homeland.

It is said that when the Zeldmitra family, which is known to have ushered in the era of the rise of the nobility, aimed to break away from the dominance of priests, they made a statement to the effect that they did not want priests who would not protect Eruo when asked to do so.

I don't know how the word "Eruo" was interpreted at that time, but he may have switched the interpretation to "Eruo = earth" to make a good argument for the transition of power from priestly rule to aristocratic rule.

Considering the historical background, it is natural that the nobles who broke away from the priestly rule would take pride in protecting the earth.

The rule of the aristocracy was the result of taking away the position of guardian of the earth from the priests.

On the other hand, I didn't know that the priests didn't place that much importance on protecting the earth until I heard Cynthia's story.

As a person who finds religious miracles to be scandalous, I can still understand the idea of nobles trying their best to protect the earth.

It had been a long time since the church had been destroyed in the Kingdom of Levios.

The words of Tiamesarail, the spirit of the snowfield, have already evolved in the aristocratic society, and it can be said that they have created a value system that is not chivalry but nobility.

And I'm convinced that this is the biggest gap between the values of nobles and priests.

"Tiamessa Rail might be a friend of Getulanaga."

"Huh?"

"Hm?　What about Getulanaga, the spirit of the battlefield?

The words of Tiamessa Rail fueled the conflict between the noblemen and the priests, and I sarcastically said that they must be close friends with the spirits of the battlefield, but it seems that my intelligence-filled joke was not understood.

"I know that, but I was wondering why Getulanaga, the spirit of the battlefield."

According to Cynthia, Getulanaga has a difficult personality, and if you want to call him a friend, there are plenty of fighting spirits who would be more suitable.

Unfortunately, I've read the scriptures, but I haven't read many of the spin-offs of the scriptures, such as saint conversations and spirit guidebooks, so I know very little about the personalities of spirits.

I've never read many of those books, and I don't know much about the personalities of spirits.

"The name came out as familiar. I'm sorry for the embarrassment."

Cynthia, realizing that she had embarrassed herself, apologized, though she was flustered.

"You can ask the name of Getulanaga, the spirit of the ...... battlefield, of Princess Orcian?"

"Yes. I'm sure you've heard at least some gossip about it in the city, haven't you?

Princess Orcian of House Myrendorva, who challenged the Levios royal family head-on, winning battle after battle and invading at an incredible speed, is even called the incarnation of Getulanaga because of her overwhelming fighting ability.

Whether it was a lie or not, a priest of the Holy High Society, who had been hiding his identity and spying on the Levios territory, saw Princess Orcian's rapid progress and said, "The Levios family, woe!　She is the very incarnation of Getulanaga!　She is the very incarnation of Getulanaga! Receive the hammer of the spirits! She is the very incarnation of Getulanaga!"

That's why the saga of Princess Orcian and the name of Getulanaga have been spreading together.

Cynthia told me some of the gossip she had heard in the city, but I felt like she was telling me the ideal image of Orcian, interpreted in a priestly way.

Well, it can't be helped that from the perspective of the Holy High Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is a part of her that seems to be a savior.

Having gossiped about the city, the political talk died down and moved on to the heartwarming stories of everyday life.

It started with the story of my days in Cynthia's New Nellie City, then became the story of my travels when I came into the territory of Quardenze, and then back to the story of my life in the Holy City.

As I knew very little about the current situation in the Holy City, it was interesting and fresh for me.

"...... Wow, the Holy City is recovering faster than I thought."

From what I've heard, it seems that the Holy City of Maguaose is much further along in its reconstruction than I had imagined.

"I had heard about the Holy City from peddlers visiting New Nelly, but they said it was a wasteland and dirt city at the end of the century. Did they use a sycophant?"

In recent years, reconstruction has progressed and some of the priestly territories seem to be regaining strength.

I was a little baffled by Cynthia, who didn't hide any information about the holy city, but rather talked about it as if she wanted people to be interested.

If I ask her a question, she responds quickly without bothering to answer. The Kingdom of Levios and St. Navenpos are enemies, but her lack of caution makes me uneasy.

I'm not sure if she meant what she said when she said she came to New Nellie City to work on dispelling the bad impression of the Holy High Society.

"...... Oh yeah, what kind of person is the head priestess of this generation?"

"Holy priestess?"

Cynthia put her hand on her cheek and straightened her posture.

"She is a wonderful woman."

"Well, what does she look like?"

It is said that a beautiful girl is chosen from a famous family, so the shaman must be quite beautiful.

Depending on the situation, the nobles of the Kingdom of Levios may invade St. Navenpos, it's worth listening to.

I'll give you the holy priestess!　Do as you please! "That's right, the Leviathans know what they're talking about! There is no guarantee that this will not happen.

It's also possible that the followers of the holy city will be treated to a public rape show by the holy priestess who lost the war.

Cynthia explained the appearance of the holy priestess, using spirits as an analogy.

To put it bluntly, it made little sense to me, but I could tell she was beautiful.

"She is a beautiful girl with black hair and black eyes, a year younger than me. ...... Of course she is beautiful in appearance, but above all, it is her heart that is precious as she faces the scriptures. Her faith can be said to be a model for all believers."

As I was creating an image of the priestess in my mind from her words, I seemed to be a bit preoccupied.

Cynthia talked more about the faith of the shaman.

I was thinking about the suspicion I had heard from my father: that the priestess was black-hearted.

My father believes that the priestess is a powerful vixen with a scheming nature.

The current Kingdom of Levios ......, or rather the Royal House of Levios, is eager to invade St. Navenpos by mobilizing all the nobles of the kingdom.

There are two purposes for this. One is to regain the centripetal force of the royal family, and the other is to stabilize the kingdom.

Just as the Quardenze family used the Battle of Nambonan City to unite the western nobility, war is the quickest way for the boss to show his leadership.

If we think about where to wage war, the answer will naturally converge on St. Navenpos.

In the past, the House of Levios became the banner of the anti-Holy High Society, united the hearts of the surrounding nobles, and founded the Kingdom of Levios. Beating up the Holy High Society will lead to the return of the "strong House Levios" of the past.

In addition, prisoners of war are an inevitable part of war. The Kingdom of Levios is desperate for them.

Currently, due to the strange disease spread by the demonic beast Yersinia, the number of nobles, or in other words, the number of the ancestors, has been drastically reduced.

The only way to solve this problem is for the nobles to bear children, but since the number of princesses, the main ancestors, has also decreased, it is not an easy matter to solve.

The weaker noble families are unable to secure wives, and they are looking for daughters blessed by spirits in their territories. The royal family of Levios even forced their daughters who were married off to other families to return to their homes.

St. Navenpos is a land of priests, and the high priests of the ruling class are the main ancestors.

The royal family of Levios must be thinking of stealing the daughters of the high priests in the war and distributing them to the noble families of the kingdom in order to stabilize the country.

Now, the one who will be troubled by this is the invading side, St. Navenpos.

If the aristocrats of the Kingdom of Levios were to unite and approach us, it would be an extremely difficult task to oppose them.

Even if we succeeded in defending ourselves, we wouldn't be able to count on the Holy City, which was on the verge of recovery, being burned to the ground again.

If I were the Pope of the Holy High Society, my first priority would be to avoid war, and even if war broke out, I would want to move with an early ceasefire in mind.

In any case, if you're dealing with the entire Levios Kingdom, you'll never win in a long-term war. They are outnumbered in terms of population, economic power, production power, and territory area.

Therefore, they decided to negotiate with the royal family of Levios using the great nobles of the kingdom as intermediaries. If I had to choose one of the five major noble families to mediate, I would choose the Quardenze family.

This is because they have the highest probability of success in negotiating a ceasefire.

From a practical point of view, it would be very inconvenient for the Leviathans to destroy the Holy High Society and conquer all of St. Navenpos.

Since Levios' territory and St. Navenpos are far away from each other, any territory they get would be an enclave.

Even though St. Navenpos was ravaged by the uprising 200 years ago, it was originally so rich that it was said to be the land where the spirits of fertility took a nap.

I don't know how long it will take, but once the pollution of the land is cleansed, it will grow to be one of the best territories in the continent.

It may be delicious in the future, but managing an enclave is not something that can be done well. If the enclaves are managed poorly and the magical beast disaster spreads, they will end up in the same place as before.

As for how to manage it, it would be appropriate to create a branch family with a non-Levios heir as the head, and place it in St. Navenpos after its destruction, but that would be psychologically difficult. However, it would be psychologically difficult to do so because the failure of the Millendorva family is still fresh in their minds.

Considering the civil war with the House of Millendorva, which was created to control the Far East region, we would not want to place a branch of the family there.

Therefore, even if the Levios family got the land of St. Navenpos, they would not be able to keep it.

In the event of an all-out war with St. Navenpos, the noble families located in the southern part of the kingdom would have more opportunities to play an active role.

If this were to happen, they would have a legitimate claim to the territory during the post-war cut-and-paste time. The Marquis of Zeldmitra, a great aristocrat from the south who is desperate for rich land, will be wielding a pizza cutter at this point.

Since the Zeldmitra family is located in the southernmost part of the kingdom, St. Navenpos is close by and easy to manage. If the need arose, they could even eliminate the enclave problem by annexing the free cities in between.

If the Zeldmitra family successfully absorbed St. Navenpos and the surrounding areas, the Levios family would feel threatened.

The birth of a powerful noble family in the south is something that House Levios should be wary of.

What's more frightening is that it may not end there.

It is possible that the Zeldmitra family will continue to expand southward and grow into a huge noble family that absorbs not only the Free City Counties but also the Ricarda Confederacy.

Following the Kingdom of Levios, the Zinkhaen Empire, and the Mamshred Federation, a fourth great power may emerge.　

Several generations after Zeldmitra Kraad, the founder of the Middle Kingdom who advocated a break from priestly rule and became a pioneer in the era of the rise of the nobility, the Zeldmitra family has always been a distinguished family, and the next head of the family is also reputed to be excellent. The next head of the family has a reputation for excellence, and we should be wary of his moves.

Furthermore, considering the history of the two families, the Zeldmitra family and the Quardenze family are not so much in love, but they are on good terms.

What will happen if these two families join forces and secede from the kingdom? Even if you consider the existence of small and medium-sized noble families that are sympathetic to the secession, it would be fatal for the Kingdom of Levios. At least, if I were a legitimate son of House Levios, I would definitely want to avoid that.

Taking these political factors into consideration, I thought about the war goals of the Leviathans.

The most desirable development would be to show leadership to the nobles of the kingdom by beating up St. Navenpos, and then some great noble would bring a messenger to negotiate peace.

We can pose as if we're in a good mood and we don't mind fighting more, but we respect the big nobles who are mediating and get on the negotiation table.

And at the negotiating table, I can show my diplomacy and get the Holy High Priestess to swear obedience to the Kingdom of Levios by taking her daughter as compensation and hostage. In return, he would grant St. Navenpos autonomy and relieve him of his lands.

In this way, the prestige of the royal family was restored, the domestic nobles were able to welcome the daughter of the founder, the southern nobles did not increase their territory, and the Holy High Society succumbed to the Levios royal family. ............ It was a very convenient development.

The important thing here is the existence of a great nobleman who can mediate the peace negotiations.

If the aristocrats, who are the henchmen of the Levios royal family, were to act as intermediaries, the Levios royal family's intention to negotiate for peace as soon as possible would be too obvious and they might lose the trust of the aristocrats.

Therefore, the Seikoukai needed to ask the five major noble families in the kingdom, excluding the Levios family, to act as intermediaries.

The first thing to consider is that the Zeldmitra family is out of the question. From their point of view, it is in their interest to continue the war, so they would never act as an intermediary.

The Millendorva and Aterahan families might be willing to act as intermediaries, but they are also far away from St. Navenpos, and it is unknown how seriously they will take the matter.

The best choice would be the Quardenze family.

They are at war with the old Voistra, and they don't want to participate in the Levios' expedition to St. Navenpos.

They have the same interests in wanting to make a truce, so they can be trusted in that area.

The existence of the Quardenze family is important to the Holy High Priestess Association.

That is why my father suspects that the priestess is a scheming woman.

He may have sent Cynthia to New Nellie City ahead of time in anticipation of the war with the Kingdom of Levios that would eventually come and its course.

She may have secretly formed a friendship with the Quardenze family through Cynthia, and when the time came to negotiate a ceasefire, she would appear on the scene to show her leadership.

It may be a ploy by the shaman to regain his lost authority and return as the head of the faith.

..... father told me not to trust the priestess.

I could tell that my father was even more wary than usual of the unreadable presence of a priest.

But he also said that even if he didn't trust her, he would make the most of what he could.

In most organizations, the more people there are, the more factions there are, and the more resources are devoted to infighting.

If the priestess, who has regained her authority, joins the High Priestess Council, which is currently run by the Pope and the High Priest, the balance will collapse at once.

If the Quardenze and Levios families could support the priestess and make her their puppet, it would come in handy in many ways.

I see, she thinks of showing the other side the benefits first to satisfy her own desires. She seems to be a very clever girl.

It may be that the Cattleyauk family, the family behind her, is giving the orders, but she is a girl you can never be too careful with.

...... No, it's not confirmed that she's black-hearted.

It seems that because of my father's suspicions, the priestess in my brain is becoming an incredibly evil woman.

I felt a little bad for Cynthia, who kept talking passionately about how wonderful the priestess was.

I know what Cynthia is going to say. ...... It looks like it's getting pretty late already.

Looking out the window, I saw that the height of the moon had moved more than I expected. It seems that a good deal of time had passed in scripture lessons and chit-chat.

"I'm sorry, but that's all I have to say for tonight."

"Yes, unfortunately. If you'll allow me to come back next time, I'd love to talk to you about the scriptures at ......."

It was a real shame.

As my father concluded, Cynthia's house arrest would continue.

She has not committed any crime, but it is the power of the nobility that allows them to capture her.

It is unclear to what extent she has gained the trust of the shaman, but depending on the situation, she may become a diplomatic card.

This is why the Quardenze family has decided to keep Cynthia under house arrest until the kingdom's course of action is decided in the spring at the royal capital.

With the old Voistra as an element of concern, the Quardenze family would want to secure anything that could be used for diplomacy, even if it was unlikely.

I talked to Cynthia this time, and I also think that there is no problem with my father's policy. In other words, there will be no change in policy.

And that means that I should not touch Cynthia.

If I do, she may have a big belly by the end of spring, and I may have to show her my weakness.

If it were true, it would have been a nice way to end tonight's conversation and continue in bed.

If Cynthia hadn't been a special priestess working for the shaman, she would have been able to do whatever she wanted.

Is this some kind of conspiracy by the shaman?

I felt as if I could hear the mockery of the holy priestess in my brain.

Chapter 159 - Abrolle's spider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most unpopular animals on the continent of Eruo is the spider.

This is because spiders have an image of being cunning and cowardly, preying on their enemies through dirty means.

If you compare someone to a spider, it is safe to say that you are trying to humiliate them.

Galiana Milord, the current head of the noble house of Levios, the Viscount Galiana. Although he now goes by the family name of Galiana, he was born a commoner.

Under normal circumstances, a child born to a commoner, or a slave ancestor, would only become a slave ancestor. However, in extremely rare cases, a child would be born that would be classified as the main ancestor.

People believe that these children were born with the blessings of the spirits.

Milord was a perfect example of this, born in the continent of Eruo as a rare commoner of the main ancestor.

A child born with the blessing of the spirits is a threat to the nobility.

The ancestor is born with immense magical power and can defeat a knight alone even at a young age.

This is why nobles hunt for the Patriarch. If the child they find is a boy, they kill him, and if it is a girl, they take her for breeding.

In a world governed by nobility, Milord's short life would have been over.

Milord was born in the western part of the continent, struggling in the turbulent waters of the age.

Although the empire had been established by the western hegemon, Emperor Jinkaen, the heat of the turbulent times that had lasted for more than a century was yet to cool down.

The noble families in the western part of the continent were struggling to keep up with the new era of the Jinkaen Empire, and had little resources to devote to hunting for the ancestors in their territories.

Not only were nobles and knights actively involved in the hunt for the ancestors, but snitching was also encouraged. This meant that any village that harbored a blessed child would be destroyed by the nobles.

Milord was raised in secret by his parents, but one day, when he was five years old, a series of unfortunate events led to him being spotted by the villagers.

Regardless of the circumstances, the fact that the village had kept the blessed child a secret for five years was a serious matter, and there was no guarantee that the lord's condemnation would stop at the parents' heads.

Thus, Milord was banished from the village along with his parents, and began his journey of wandering around.

Unlike Milord, who had the strong body of his ancestor, his parents, who had the body of their slave ancestor, could not endure the harsh journey and died within a year.

The young Milord, who was left behind, stood on the edge of despair, but continued his efforts to learn about the world. It was all for the sake of survival.

One day, Milord, who was living like a beggar, came up with the idea of working as a peddler's guard.

At that time, the western part of the continent was a hodgepodge of bandits, brigands, and everything in between, making it extremely unsafe. There was always a demand for skilled mercenaries.

Knowing that no peddler would hire a blessed child as an escort, and that commoners could not understand the difference in the amount of magic power between the main ancestor and the sub-ancestor, Milord posed as the sub-ancestor's child and ransacked the peddlers.

The employer he was looking for was not a well paid peddler, but a smart peddler.

Milord, who had been wandering around with little knowledge of the world, believed that knowledge was necessary for survival, and he wanted to get close to a peddler who could read, write, and calculate.

Milord's teacher had always been a merchant.

One day, a few years later, Milord, who had become accustomed to working as an escort, had the idea to become a peddler himself.

He could now read, write, and do math, and he had learned that he needed money to survive.

By this time, he was able to use the magic to strengthen the strength of his horse, and he had a plan to use the power of his ancestor to peddle goods at high speed.

This idea proved to be correct, and Milord made a name for himself as a merchant.

As he traveled from place to place, Milord learned about the aristocratic society and began to think of ways to get into their pockets rather than running away.

For the aristocracy, who had a great need for goods, Milord's fast-moving peddling party was dangerous, but also very useful.

The more the Jinkaen Empire consolidated its system, the more the hunt for the ancestors resurged, but Milord succeeded in surviving under the protection of the noble families he was close to.

Eventually, Milord poured the money he earned into the border city of Nambonan and solidified his position as a member of the council.

Milord did not stop. Because there was hope for him.

　

When he was a beggar, when he was a peddler's guard, when he was a merchant making money, and even after he became a member of the Nambonan Council, he still wanted the same thing.

"I'd like to be a lord," he'd always murmured.

If you are born a slave, you can never hope to be one, but if you are a lord, you can .......

Was it inevitable that the money-strapped head of the Galiana family would ask for assistance, or was it a matter of Eruo history?

Milord approached her with a smile, tied her hands together, and then succeeded in squeezing her hand.

The spider of Abrawl.

The nobles called him that because he had risen from a humble background to a man of talent alone in a single generation.

"It seems that Lord Wilk has very good taste."

In a room of the castle that stands on a small hill overlooking the city of Abrawl, the home of the Galiana family, the man known as the spider smiles a wry smile.

He and his old friend are the only ones in the large room, and there are no guards or servants. The sound of empty goblets on the desk echoed well.

"You were right, he was an unusual man."

As if in response to Milord's voice, he too drank the goblet in one gulp and placed it on the desk.

He, Doran, the head of the Gandolan Trading Company, had been Milord's merchant companion and friend since their commoner days. Even now that he is an aristocrat, he is still Milord's confidant.

"I'm sure it's a lot of work for Oras to put on a play with the legitimate son of the Quardenze family. I would have liked to have participated in it anyway."

The other day, Dolan had just returned to Abrawl City, where the company's head office is located, after finishing a business meeting in Nambonan City.

In the past, Milord has set up private venues without the Galiana family's guards or servants to invite acquaintances from his days as a merchant and gather information.

As usual, Doran was summoned to the castle this time, and as soon as he heard about the business meeting, Milord became very interested.

He thought it was just a story about selling elf sex slaves to the city of Nambonan, but somehow it turned into a play where the legitimate son of a marquis and a commoner performed together. It was such an unexpected turn of events that Milord could not catch up for a moment.

"I don't want to do another play that makes me so nervous."

"Hahaha!　I bet you do!"

The name of the great noble family, the Quardenze, is too heavy for a commoner to bear, and if they were displeased, he may be reduced to ashes the next moment.

For Doran, the business meeting was literally a life-threatening one.

As an ex-commoner and ex-merchant, Milord understood that feeling to the point of belly laughing.

After listening to the whole episode of Wilk's slave purchase, Milord opens his mouth while pouring himself a drink by hand.

"...... So, what's next?"

"It's gonna work."

Dolan talks about the feeling of the business meeting, and tells us that Wilk seemed to be interested in a slave who specializes in sexual skills.

From the way Wilk was acting, Dolan read that there was a good chance that a purchase call would come.

"I'm glad to see you're not just another nobleman." Milord said as he put his fist on his crotch and made his thumb stand up straight. While many aristocratic men are timid about their sexuality, Wilk's strong sexual desire is very rare.

Even when it comes to selling sex slaves, there are only two at most that can be sold to one nobleman. Doran was happy to have caught a big customer, but he felt that he would have a lot of heartache if he had to do the same play every time.

"It had been a while since he'd been to New Nelly City, but it had been even worse. It was like you were possessed by your libido."

This was the story of a visit to New Nellie City with Eve and several sex slaves.

What Dolan didn't know was that Wilk's sexual appetite was at an all-time high due to his masturbation abstinence, so he had a lot of energy.

"...... And you've put a lot into that, haven't you?"

"I'm just a merchant in noble clothes. I have to keep investing to survive." Milord replies with a mouthful of snack nuts and a popping sound.

"But is it safe?　I'm too biased towards the Quardenze family. ......"

House Galiana's Foreign Policy......No, Galiana Milord's foreign policy is to focus on the Quardenze family.

However, there are many members of the Galiana family who disagree with this.

"The Aterahans?"

"Well, you know what I mean.

The Galiana territory is sandwiched between the Aterahan family, who is the first in the north of the kingdom, and the Quardenze family, who is the first in the west.

This is why the Galiana family was divided on which side should be given priority in diplomacy.

　

In addition, the opinion that the Aterahan family should be given priority is overwhelmingly more common. This is because the Aterahan family is closer to the Galiana family than the Aterahan family.

"The Aterahans are closer to us than we are to them. The closer I get to House Aterahan, the more my position is compromised."

Even though he was the current head of the Galiana family, Milord's position was a delicate one.

There are a lot of people who don't like the idea of Milord hiding in the house of Galiana as an adopted son at the instigation of the previous head of the family who was in financial trouble.

As soon as he became the head of the family, he made full use of his ability and connections from his days as a commoner to rebuild the family's finances, and no one could blame him.

But that was only until the reconstruction was completed.

Once the finances are sound, the only things that will remain are the surplus territories and the commoner-born heads of the families. It was obvious that they would want to get rid of the latter.

Milord has been cooperating with the Quardenze family in various ways. For example, he advised them to take control of Nambonan City.

He fully supported the invasion of Nambonan City, and has been helping them even after the occupation. Gaining the confidence of the Marquis of Quardenze was necessary for his own safety.

For the Galiana family members to pull down Milord, who is committed to the Quardenze family, would lead to hostility.

Milord has established a formula that if he were to be eliminated, he would be viewed as an enemy by the Quardenze family.

"I guess they don't like commoners."

"So I'm just a hired nobleman. I can't use magic as well as a real noble, and I'm not as strong."

"Is that how it is?"

"That's the way it is. You can't allow yourself to get down with a diminutive spider that is weak and can only make money."

Having risked his life to survive in the aristocratic society, Milord knew very well how giving in to the weak is an act that hurts the dignity of the nobility.

"Huh, the Aterahans, the most powerful family in the kingdom. ...... Very silly. A noble family bound by old ideas."

Milord understood, but had no sympathy for the idea that force is the proof of a ruler.

When he said that the merchants were just wearing the clothes of the nobility, he meant it.

"It's the same for all nobles, isn't it?　The reason why the Galiana's are so close to the Aterahan's is because they are attracted to warriors."

Doran said this, but in reality, he was more frightened than attracted to her.

The Galiana family is not strong enough to make an enemy of the Aterahan family, which is regarded as the strongest force in the kingdom, not only among the nobility but also among the commoners.

The nobles are not all the same. You know better than anyone that there are some unusual nobles who put on a show to buy slaves.

"Yes, well..."

"Lord Wilk is an interesting nobleman, yes ....... Interesting."

Feeling Milord's voice become serious, Dolan remained silent and waited for the next words.

Milord slowly continued, his face tilted upward and his eyes narrowed as if he was tracing a memory.

"I'm not sure how many years ago ...... it was when I first spoke with Wilk-dono, and he said at the time. He told me that the time of the aristocracy would eventually end."

Dolan rolled his eyes at the fact that the heir to the Quardenze family, the noblest of the noble families, had spoken words of self-denial.

Milord confirmed the situation and asked Dolan what he thought.

"I hadn't thought of that. But I didn't think that the legitimate son of the Quardenze family would be anticipating the restoration of the Holy High Society. ......"

When Dolan mistakenly thought that the age of priests would return, Milord waved his hand in denial.

"The Lord Wilk said that a new era is coming."

"A new era?"

"Yes. The age of faith and priests is over, and the age of military might and nobility has arrived. Just like that, he said, new values and new rulers will make the present a thing of the past."

For a nobleman who was tied to the land and tended to be inward-looking and conservative, Wilk's words seemed very fresh to Milord.

By the way, Wilk had been thinking about the content of his advanced talk since the night before, in order not to be underestimated as a member of the Quardenze family by the "Abrolle's spider" whom he was meeting for the first time.

Wilk, who was not obsessed with the supremacy of the aristocracy's military might, honestly appreciated and was wary of Milord's capitalistic rise to power.

"That's an interesting thought. So, what comes after the age of nobility?"

"The age of authority and kings is coming.  The age of kings with absolute power. From a decentralized system that ruled each region, comes the age of centralized power with an authoritative and absolute king at the top."

Wilk, who had memorized the world history of Earth, spoke of the coming of absolute monarchy as if it were his own idea.

"Authority and Kings ....... A form like the Kingdom of Voistra?"

"The Kingdom of Voistra, the kingdom destroyed by Emperor Zinkhaen, was a ruling system similar to an absolute monarchy."

It is a rare country where the main ancestor kneeled to the main ancestor, the king, and was completely subordinate to him.

"That's right. I've heard that it's more like the state that Emperor Jin Kahen was aiming for."

The goal of the Zinkhaen Empire was to centralize power and strengthen the royal authority.

They are trying to learn from the lack of cohesion of the noble families in the Kingdom of Levios, their predecessor state. However, the current situation is a setback.

"I see."

"Doran, we have more to talk about."

Milord continued to talk to Dolan, who was about to conclude that Wilk was a fan of Emperor Zinkhaen.

He was about to conclude that Wilk was a fan of the emperor.

"The age of authority and kings is coming. Then, what will come after that? Lord Wilk answered without hesitation."

"Oh, what?"

But Milord didn't answer right away. It wasn't that he was pushy. He couldn't speak because he remembered the excitement that had arisen when he heard it.

"...... is the age of freedom and the people. They say it will bring down the age of kings."

Doran spat with a gulp.

"By the people, you mean the common people?"

"That's right. ...... Isn't Lord Wilk interesting?　What nobleman would dare to say that the time of the common people is coming?"

Doran's smile deepened when he saw Milord speaking in a good mood.

It was because he understood the real reason for his recent devotion to the Quardenze family.

"There is one more person. You, Milord."

Milord disliked the way of thinking of the nobles, who uniformly looked down on the commoners as powerless people.

It is true that without the power of the nobility, the earth would not be able to be protected. However, without the commoners, they would not be able to provide even a single grain of wheat or a single weapon.

Milord, who had dealt in many goods as a peddler, believed that the day would come when the power of the commoners would surpass the power of the nobles.

His desire to become a lord and nobleman was rooted in his wish to develop the power of the commoners to the fullest without the interference of the nobles.

Milord laughed at Dolan's point and stirred his drink.

"The ...... Quardenze family is going to turn."

In a voice so low it melted in the darkness, Milord spoke.

"What would happen if we destroyed all of the old Voistra factions in the Empire and annexed them as fiefdoms? If you only look at the potential of the territories, they would surpass the Levios royal family."

Like a snake devouring its prey, the former Voistra Kingdom would be swallowed whole by the Quardenze family.

If you simply think about it, there is no doubt that they will surpass the Levios in terms of food production and population.

"Will it be that easy?"

"No, it won't. The old Voistra is exhausted from the prolonged war and the centipede's legs will be entangled."

The most troublesome problem with invading another territory is the remnants of the knightly family.

The relationship between nobles and knights is similar to that between parents and children. Knights are unlikely to betray their masters, the nobles.

Therefore, when the noble family, which is the boss of the knight family, is destroyed, the people of the knight family, who have nowhere else to go, are prepared to die a martyr's death in order to avenge their master's enemies.

Since the members of the knightly family have many followers and are familiar with the land, it is very difficult to suppress them.

These problems were described as centipede legs getting entangled.

A centipede with a crushed head has no choice but to die, but if you try to stop it, it can get entangled in your still moving legs.

Clearing a new territory takes a lot of work, and the power of a territory does not increase overnight.

Even more so when it comes to feeding off the great power of the old Voistra.

The potential of the territory may surpass that of the Leviathans, but it will take many years for the real power to return.

Isn't the question whether we can defeat them before they're leveled?"

"Castle Raishleaf. ...... Voistra's Great Shield?"

In the past, the Kingdom of Voistra was invaded by Emperor Zinkhaen.

This is a war against a large army directly led by the Emperor Jin Kahen, who is known as the Dragon of the West Sea, the son of turbulent times, the Sun Emperor, the High King, the King of Heroes ......, and many other names.

The battle began at Raishleaf Castle, a key defensive position and a cover for the entrance to the Voistra Plains, and ended in victory for the defenders, the Kingdom of Voistra.

However, when the King of Voistra learned of Emperor Zinkhaen's strength in this battle, he chose to surrender and join the Empire soon after.

Whatever the case, the achievement of preventing the invasion of the Jinkaen Emperor was widely known throughout the continent.

It was a common understanding throughout the continent that it would not be easy to defeat the hardest shield protecting the Voistra Plains, the castle of Raishleaf.

"The military commander said it would take ten years for the current Quardenze army to defeat Castle Raishleaf."

"Ten years. ...... That's a bit of a stretch. General Galfis is old, can he still be on the battlefield in ten years? ......"

Galfis, Wilk's grandfather, was already in his eighties. Although the main ancestor was strong, it would be hard for him to stand on the battlefield in his nineties.

"I'd like to see you stand there, Wilk-dono. He may be an important son, but the Marquis of Quardenze is a bit overprotective."

"But there's only one boy in the family, right?　I can understand why you don't want him to be on the battlefield, where he could be in danger."

Milord snickered at Dolan's opinion.

"Ha, what danger is there? There are not many nobles who can harm Lord Wilk. The first time he showed that magic power ...... in his first battle, it was terrifying."

Milord participated in the battle for the city of Nambonan, where he learned of Wilk's magical power.

Just remembering it made his arms milky and his voice quiet.

"Was it that great?"

Milord did not reply to Dolan's question.

It was as if he was being told that he could not express himself in words.

"...... Well, okay. If it takes ten years for the castle to be built, and then five years for the invasion of Othelloria City, that's fifteen years. By that time, Wilk-dono might be sitting at the head of the Quardenze family."

"That's quite possible."

In fifteen years, the seeds Wilk-dono sowed will have grown into splendid squires. There will be no shortage of human resources in the Knight family. There will be no shortage of knightly talent, which will make things much easier after the annexation.

To start a new reign, you need knights, and that means you need squires.

If you look at Wilk, who has already done so much, it is easy to imagine the rush of talent in 15 years.

"It's that Wilk-dono who will rule over New Nelly City and Othelloria City, the Quardenze territory that has annexed these two major cities. Doesn't that excite your heart?"

"Indeed, ......."

Although still almost unknown among the nobility, the name of Quardenze Wilk is spreading among the merchants.

As a nobleman who not only thinks up and implements innovative products and systems, but also has a flexible mind that understands the civil government of Nambonan City. What would happen if that Wilk ruled two major cities in the middle of the continent? ......

Doran felt his own heart pounding.

"I am." Milord said.

I've always wanted to see what Lord Wilk meant by a time of commoners. A new era.

It was as if he was spilling it out.

"I want dream a new dream."

The man who had dreamed of being a lord was now about to dream a new dream.

"I'm a commoner. I don't think I'll live to see that age."

His eyes were bright and shining. They are the same eyes that I saw when I decided to escort the peddler.

"If so, at least let me see the time of the king."

If the age of kings would eventually lead to the age of commoners, ending the age of nobles would be the path to his dream.

The spider, who had longed to be a nobleman, was now about to move beyond that.

"It's a good thing I'm a merchant because I can invest in the future. That's right, the target is ......."

It was no longer Viscount Galiana who was there. It was the merchant Milord.

"Quardenze Wilk, King of the Unified Continent."

"A commoner could become a nobleman, there is no way that a nobleman could become a king of nobles."

Doran's eyes widened at these words, and Milord laughed out loud.

The men who talked about their dreams were always pure and innocent.

Chapter 160 - Tutor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I told her that she would continue to be under house arrest, Cynthia's expression hardened and she nodded.

It seemed that she was not so daredevil as to object to the nobleman's decision.

Her obedient demeanor and a little bit of pouting was cute.

"I'm sure you're not busy being cooped up in a museum. I can deliver some reading material to you later, what do you want?"

"In that case, please send me the scriptures at ......."

The museum officer took note of Cynthia's wishes and I promised to deliver them.

There's nothing wrong with delivering a scripture or two.

It seems that the Holy High Church in New Nellie City has a small library, or rather, a class library of bookshelves, and I will pick up some of the books from there and carry them.

The head of the church is still on the run, so soldiers are still waiting at the church. You are free to take anything out of the church as long as you get my orders.

"I understand. There is one thing I would like you to do for me instead."

"What is it?"

Of course, I'm not going to sexually harass you yet.

"You said earlier that you wanted me to talk to you about the scriptures again. I thought I'd ask you to do the same. What do you think, I'd like you to teach me about the scriptures for a while."

After talking with Cynthia, I realized the limitations of self-education.

There are many parts of the scriptures that I don't understand just by reading them, and if I misinterpret them, I will make an embarrassing mistake.

There is a real priest who has studied so diligently that he can recite the scriptures, and if he's not busy anyway, it would be good to have him as my tutor.

In the meantime, my father has given me permission to see Cynthia. No sexual intercourse, though.

There are many things I would like to know about St. Navenpos, so I would love to have Cynthia as my tutor.

"Are you sure?"

Cynthia stares at me, her eyes shining. I didn't expect her to say no, but I didn't expect her to be so pleased.

When I told her I was serious, she smiled, putting her palms to her chest as if to say, "Leave it to me."

"I think I'll be calling you after dinner more often. I'll have her call you later to discuss the details."

"I'll be waiting."

Given my schedule, after dinner is the most free time I have. I'm currently studying with Fanny, but I'll assign Cynthia's class here.

Perhaps it's because I'm interested in the Zeth religion, but Fanny has read a bit of the scriptures. I'm sure she'll enjoy it.

If my father tells me that Cynthia will be banned soon, we can go to bed after class. It's a dream come true.

As Cynthia left the room, flanked again by the military officers, I yawned and headed for the bedroom.

The end of the year was as hectic as ever in the castle, and I spent many days visiting the villa to get away from the hustle and bustle.

It would have been fine if I had just gone about my life as usual, but somehow I didn't feel comfortable being alone in that atmosphere.

In the villa, I could relax and enjoy myself with Minute, who was really happy to see me, and Eve, who was smiling at me.

I called up Eve at the villa and Mimmon who lived in the city and hugged them over and over, and when I came back to the castle at night, I had the girls who were in charge of the baths slurp and slurp on different days. I think I'm going to have kidney deficiency.

Today was the last day of the year, or New Year's Eve as it was called in the past in Japan.

Although I was in a position where I didn't have to do any cleaning, I came to the villa today to clean my testes.

It's not easy to play in the daytime when you're in the castle, because you never know when Fanny will show up.

"I've sent out a messenger, so please wait a little longer. I'm sure he'll be here shortly."

"Oh."

I looked at the servant, who was solemn, and replied.

I closed the bookmark in the book I was reading, lightly moistened my throat with tea, and turned my body around.

Where are you now?

It was only rather recently that I noticed that Lupetta had disappeared.

I had returned to New Nellie City a little while ago and tried to call out to Lupetta to hold her for a while, but she had disappeared like smoke from the inn where she had been staying.

Once I thought of holding Lupetta, my dick went into Lupetta mode.

It was like going to a set meal restaurant to eat curry, but they were out of stock, so I had to eat a hamburger steak.

The hamburger was delicious, of course, but since my mouth was already in curry mode, I couldn't get enough of it.

In addition, I had a question I wanted to ask Lupetta.

When I told Tesh to look for her as soon as possible, he seemed to think that I was desperate to embrace Lupetta and sent a large number of servants to the castle despite the busy year-end season.

I did feel the need to hold her, but not so much that I couldn't stand it, so I did something a little bad.

"It seemed she had rented a house in the city. The district is ......."

According to the servant, Lupetta had apparently moved out of her temporary lodging house.

She had decided to stay in New Nellie City for a long time and was renting a tenement.

She said that it was a district where the wealthy lived in the city, so the rent would be quite high.

Well, Lupetta and her partner, Melgen, are adventurers in their own right, so they probably have money. They have a much better chance of making money than the mere slavers, people without magic power.

"How did you find me in such a short time?"

New Nellie City is a rather large city. If you look down from the high place of the castle, you can see that there are quite a few citizens.

When I think of the density of population and the cramped conditions of the city in my previous life in Japan, it's a rather lukewarm level, but I guess it's one of the most developed cities in the continent.

When I mentioned this to Viscount Galiana once, he replied with a straight face, "New Nellie City is one of the largest cities in the continent .......

I see, in modern Japan, a city of this size would be quite large in an age dominated by local lords.

I don't think Viscount Galiana would use sycophancy on me, so I'm sure it's a fair assessment.

If I were to go to the royal capital in the spring, I would have to go overland in the continent of Eruo, where there are no airplanes. Since we would have to go through other territories, we would want to observe them carefully.

No, it seems that they did not escape. ......

As soon as the servants started to explore the city, Lupetta came to the villa to report on her move.

The reason for the move was simple: she wanted a bigger room for Melgen, who had been attacked and severely injured in the field.

Melgen was treated by a healer from the Quardenze army, but the damage caused by the magic would remain in his body for a while. He wanted to rest until he was fully recovered.

"It seems that he will remain in New Nelly City for some time to come, but if ...... young master wishes, we can arrange a room for her here."

In other words, he was going to have Lupetta in his villa.

Rather than having him wandering around the city, the servants would feel more secure if he was surrounded by a tight circle.

The villa was unnecessarily large, with an area the size of a country elementary school, so there were plenty of rooms and plenty of room for one or two Lupetta's.

However, it would be uninteresting to throw everyone into the villa.

Living in a villa is like being a woman who is cut off from society and is completely mine. That's all well and good, but I think it's also interesting to have a woman who is embraced by me while still having a relationship with society.

If Lupetta were to fall in love with me and want to be with me all the time, I would take good care of her, but if not, I would basically let her be free.

"No, no need. I'll tell you if there's a need."

"Very well, sir."

The servant took a step backward and I returned my gaze to the desk.

I was wondering what I should do until Lupetta arrived at the villa, when the door knocked.

"Young Master. Lupetta has arrived.

A muffled voice came from the other side of the door. It must have been a servant who had gone to call for Lupetta.

I told Lupetta to come into the room, making my crotch a little tighter.

"...... that ............."

The servant opened the door to reveal a shrunken, upright Lupetta.

She was short and stocky and looked like a very small child.

"Hmm?　What's the matter, come in."

"............ Yes."

Rupeta came into the room with a languid, cat-like gait.

She was walking with her head down and looked as if she was about to start crying.

"...... captain."

"What?"

I had opened my arms to hug Lupetta, but she stopped a few steps before me.

The next moment, she was on her knees on the floor with her face pale. It was a pleading posture, the continental version of getting down on the ground.

"u... Mel-Melgen......!"

I don't know, I feel like Lupetta is on her knees every time she's in a Melgen-related situation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 161 - A female adventurer who has just been asked to marry the man of her dreams (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do you calculate the age of commoners?

The commoners on the continent of Eruo don't live as calendar-bound a life as they did on the previous Earth, so they are very general about it.

In a nutshell, when the year ends, the age increases by one.

Today is the New Year's Eve in the previous generation of Japan, so tomorrow all the commoners will age at the same time.

Lupetta will be eighteen, and Melgen will be sixteen.

And although it depends on the region, commoners are generally considered to be adults at the age of 15 or 16.

For example, in Nambonan City, I was an adult at 16.

Well, it is not uncommon for commoners like Anna to get married at the age of 13. As for women, I guess they become adults when they are able to bear children.

I don't know where Melgen is from, and I don't have the slightest interest in him, but it seems that his perceived age of maturity was 16.

Perhaps he wanted to be married at the same time as he came of age, but on the last day of his fifteenth year, he confessed his love to Lupetta.

I've always loved you, and I want you to marry me ...... or something like that, and he gave her a razor blade as a sign of engagement.

Listening to Lupetta's complaints about Melgen, I had the image of him as a boy who couldn't be honest with a girl he liked, but it seems that he had a manly side as well.

Incidentally, it is said that a servant came to summon Lupetta just as she received the razor blade.

If the proposal had been successful, she might have been able to go straight to bed, but it was a pity that she had to wait.

The first time I was detained, it was the same, but Melgen always seems to have a bad time.

"...... Well, I get what you're saying, but why would Lupetta apologize for that?"

"What ......?"

Lupetta was proposed to by Melgen. I'm sure that's what happened.

It was obvious from his complaints that Melgen was in love with Lupetta, and even more so considering the commoner culture that marries people as soon as they find a partner without the hassle of dating.

I don't understand why Lupetta is on her knees in front of me with this tearful look on her face.

"When did that happen?"

"Oh, ...... that ...... last time we did that ...... thing."

Apparently, the last time he held Lupetta, I said that Lupetta was mine.

I must have shouted such a thing involuntarily in the excitement of sex, but I don't remember much about it. If you say I said it, I feel like I did.

In any case, what you say in bed is as unreliable as what a politician says before an election.

"Haha, I see. So you're asking me to forgive you."

A commoner who messes with a nobleman's property has no choice but to die.

It's even worse when it's a nobleman's favorite woman who has been sprayed with powder, and he won't even have any dust left, let alone powder.

"Sir, ......, please ......!"

Her shaking fingertips were adorable.

I approached Lupetta and stroked her bright indigo hair with my palm. She seems to have taken good care of it, and it has a nice texture.

"Don't worry, I wouldn't do anything to make Lupetta hate me, would I?"

"Really?"

"Have I ever lied to Lupetta?"

I've never lied to her, but I've never told her the truth either. It's not that I've never lied to you, but I'm not sure I've ever told you the truth.

Lupetta's cheeks relaxed a little and she nodded at my words.

"The captain never tells lies."

"Yes. You remembered well."

Before Lupetta could react, I placed my own lips on her small ones. It was a rewarding kiss.

Her body stiffened for a moment at the sudden kiss, but the hardness slowly melted away as he stroked her back.

"Nn...... chu...... chu, nn, yaa...... leh......."

I dug my tongue in, and Lupetta resisted, moving her tongue as if to say no.

I twirled my own tongue around her tongue, which was straining to push back against me, and tasted the watery sound.

Her tongue was hard at first, but I couldn't help but feel it melt softly and sticky as I caressed her.

"...... chu. Lupetta. ......"

"Oh, ...... no, ...... no, ...... no."

When I put my hands on her to take off her jacket, Lupetta held her body.

"What's the matter, you want a bath first?"

"No, no. ....... Well, sir, why are you ......?"

Standing up from her kneeling position, Lupetta looked at me.

She seemed genuinely surprised, and her eyes were all round, which was a little cute.

"...... I don't think we're on the same page, let's take a moment to talk."

I put my hands around Lupetta's waist and casually escort her to the bed.

Lupetta twitched when she saw that I was headed for her bed, but that was all the resistance she offered, and she meekly complied.

When I sat down on the bed, Lupetta sat down next to me.

"What's Lupetta going to do now?"

I put one hand around her waist to hold her in place, and we looked at each other so closely that our breaths almost collided.

I'm not sure if she's gotten into the habit of taking a good bath, but Lupetta looks beautiful.

I ease Lupetta's tension and ask her about her reply to Melgen's proposal and her future life.

"I'm glad ...... Melgen feels the same way. So, I want to get married ....... I've always ...... liked you, so ......."

"I see."

"So, if the captain will allow me, I would like to continue my work as an adventurer in New Nellie City. ......"

"You're not going back to your parents' house?"

Lupetta nodded.

Lupetta and Melgen liked the city of New Nellie because it was booming and there was little chance of being drafted, and they wanted to continue living there if possible.

It's a good thing that they will continue to work as adventurers.

Lupetta's body is well-trained because of her field work as an adventurer. That's why when I hugged her, I could feel the healthy elasticity of her muscles behind the softness unique to girls.

This tight and healthy body must be the result of working outside.

"All right. If you want to live in New Nellie City permanently, I'll give you some leeway."

Lupetta and the others, who are strangers, may have a hard time living in the city. I'm sure the hardships will be lessened if I, as the ruler, have a say.

He hugs Lupetta, who is happy to get a promise from a nobleman, forgetting the situation.

"...... I want to be friends with Rupetta from now on."

Before Lupetta, who was pouting in my arms, could open her mouth, I continued my story.

"Do you remember our first promise?"

"What promise?"

"You see, when Melgen was captured, Lupetta begged for his life."

Lupetta's expression hardened as she immediately remembered.

Then she turned her face away to escape my gaze.

"Lupetta said she'd be good friends with me while she was in New Nelly."

The condition of Melgen's life was that she would be my wife during my stay in New Nelly City.

I'm sure that Lupetta at that time was planning to leave New Nelly City as soon as Melgen was released.

Unfortunately, a series of unfortunate events followed, and Lupetta was unable to leave the city.

"Oh, ......, oh, ......."

"I'm glad. If you want to live in the city, then Lupetta didn't want to leave me, did you?"

I put my hands around her waist and pulled her closer to me.

I kissed the nape of her neck and neck lightly to get her in the mood for sex.

"It's not like that. ...... No, it's not. ......!"

"No, no, no, no, no. You wanted to see me, didn't you?　I wanted to meet Lupetta, too."

"Ah..."

I hugged Lupetta from behind as she tried to escape, and breathed into her ear, whispering sweetly.

He then slipped his hand through the gap between her clothes and enjoyed a soft touch on her small breasts.

Using his other hand, he loosened the belt of her pants, disturbing it little by little.

"Why ......?　Captain, will you allow me to marry you?"

"No, I don't mind that."

It would be easy to forcibly take Lupetta away from Melgen.

With the power of the aristocracy, it would be easy to keep Lupetta locked up like this, or to eliminate Melgen behind the scenes.

But I didn't want to do that. If I did that, my current relationship with Lupetta would be destroyed.

He would change from a sincere but slightly naughty aristocrat to a hateful aristocrat who stole the love of her life.

This is an exciting factor, but I was more interested in maintaining my current relationship with Lupetta.

Having an affair with a married woman, Lupetta, is also an interesting experience.

Lupetta seemed to be wondering how to understand my words, but she soon seemed to turn her attention to caressing me.

As I continued to lick her ears, place my lips over hers, and stroke her buttocks and thighs over her clothes, she shifted tantalizingly and then let out a distressed breath.

"Hmm ......?　This is ......."

"Oh!　No, no, no!　No!

I pulled down her pants and slipped my fingers into her underwear.

The tip of my finger reached her secret place and I felt a wetness.

Her lower body was ready to accept a man as she received my light caress.

"Hmmm... ....... You may say so with your mouth, but your body is honest."

This is one of those lines that I would like to say at least once in my life.

"Uhhhh!"

I can't help but love Lupetta, who is so embarrassed that she turns red all the way down to her ears.

She wriggles her body as if to escape, but the fingers that have already reached her labia restrain her movements. Every time she shook her body, she let out a sweet breath of sexuality.

I'm never in a hurry, and I gently ease Lupetta's body.

"N...... haha...... ♡ Mmm......... mnnn......, there...... ah♡"

"Good girl, good girl. You're so cute."

"Ohhh ...... ♡ ...... Oh no ...... ♡"

I stroked her head, and Lupetta lied down on me.

Pressing her head against my chest, she soaked in the pleasure of my fingers.

Her face had a look of disgust on it, but her voice was that of a female waiting to mate.

The last time I had sex with Lupetta, I felt she was more scared of pleasure, but today she was reacting much more honestly.

I can feel a change in her, as if she has learned how to accept pleasure naturally.

But I don't think she spent all her time having sex with Melgen or other men while I was away. If that was the case, there was only one answer.

I whispered softly, following my intuition.

"What do you think?　Doesn't it feel better with my hands than with your own?"

"Huh ...... ♡ Yeah ...... I like this one ...... ♡ Anh ♡"

I'm not sure if she remembered the rule about not lying to me, or if her true feelings came out of pleasure, but Lupetta revealed the fact that she had been masturbating without hesitation.

She's always been a girl with a sensitive lower half, so it's no wonder that sex with me was the catalyst for her to start masturbating.

I didn't want to make fun of her and make her shrink, so I decided to praise and develop her. I kissed her as a reward for her honesty, and then switched to thick caresses using her whole body.

"She's a good girl. I love a girl who can be honest with me."

The right hand dug in and squeezed Lupetta's clit, loosened it, and squeezed again.

Lupetta shuddered every time her finger touched her pubic mound, and when she kept her finger pressed against it, she drowned in a deep, ahhhhh, pleasure.

"So, how did Lupetta feel all by herself?"

Breathing a little harder and harder, she answers my question.

"Ugh ...... ♡ When Melgen went ...... outside to take a bath, or ...... ♡ at the inn ......."

To sum up Lupetta's mumbling, it seems that she was masturbating to me.

She said that she was in a situation where she was being forced to do it by me, and she was squirming all by herself while saying to herself, "Oh no, oh no!

It's a really bad time for Melgen to have missed such a wonderful scene.

I'm going to be the first to admit that I'm not a fan of this kind of thing.

Lupetta is a bad girl for calling out another man's name while in my bed, so I increase the stimulation by moving my fingers faster.

I also moved the palm of my hand on her breast a little harder, as if I were rubbing her nipple.

"♡, ♡♡ I, ♡ ah♡ I, dear, oh! 　♡, Captain, ahhh,  Melgen...  Why, dear me♡"

The back of Lupetta's head slammed into my chest with all its might, and a single spiteful cough escaped, and Lupetta clutched my arm with such force that I shuddered with tears in my eyes.

I could tell by the way she was breathing that she had reached her climax.

The first male caress in a long time seemed to be too stimulating for Lupetta, who had become a masturbation fanatic.

"Lupetta, how did you manage to feel so good? You're a good girl. ...... chu."

"Well...Churu...♡-♡"

The blurry-eyed Lupetta silently accepted my kiss. Her nose was breathing heavily against my face.

Looking at her beastly face, I couldn't help but become more excited.

My cock was already erect, threatening to tear my pants.

The tip of it must be soggy and wet with my juices.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 162 - A female adventurer who has just been asked to marry the man of her dreams (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I pulled down my pants and my penis slithered up vertically, as if I couldn't wait to see it.

I thrust it toward Lupetta, who stares blankly at me with melting eyes.

"Oh, ...... no, ...... no, captain, no, ...... oh, ...... no, no, no, no, ...... I didn't bring any today, so no, ...... forgive me, ......"

Lupetta backed away from the bed to get away from his penis, which was erecting menacingly.

I wondered for a moment what she hadn't brought with her, but I quickly guessed. It must be the birth control pills.

Lupetta was surprisingly good about contraception, and every time she brought a small box of Kirseshi powder.

This time, she must have forgotten all about it because she was surprised by Melgen's proposal.

"Would it be okay if I brought my own?"

"No, no!"

I pulled Lupetta's flustered arms around me and hugged her from behind.

He wrapped his arms around her body as if they were two people in a cloak, stretched his neck and kissed her sideways.

"Lupetta...... chu...... chu, hmmm...... chu, hmmm."

" Mmm, chu......♡ Mmm......"

I kiss and caress her as I take off her clothes.

I had a little trouble getting her pants off, but when I saw her wet, dark underwear, I couldn't help but snort.

"Come on, Lupetta. I want to hold you."

Once we were both in our natural state, I turned to Lupetta.

"Uu......"

"I want to hold you because I love you, sweet Lupetta."

"Ugh. ......"

"Melgen is married to Lupetta and they will be together forever. It's not fair."

I don't know what's so unfair about it. I don't know what's sneaky about it, but if I had to guess, I'd say I'm the sneaky one.

"Don't worry, I won't tell Melgen. Let's get comfortable together. See?"

"Sir, ......"

Lupetta's resistance weakened. I see. Is it okay if I don't tell Melgen? Or did she just want to feel good?

At any rate, being the gentle captain that I am, I decided to prepare an excuse for Lupetta.

"Lupetta is a good girl. She really cares about Melgen. ......"

"......Yes, Melgen is my favorite. ......"

This is a prelude.

"I'm a bad guy. I know how Lupetta feels about me, but I can't control it. There's nothing wrong with Lupetta. It's all my fault. ......"

"Sir, ......"

"I love you, Lupetta. ......"

While speaking in a serious tone, he began to caress her breasts with both hands.

By making myself the bad guy, I can give Lupetta the excuse that it's not my fault. I hope this will help her enjoy sex with me without any hesitation.

"Kuhu......n...... haha......♡"

Lupetta had always been easy to feel in her lower body, but not so much in her breasts.

This is the first time I've ever seen a woman's breasts look like that.

Her breasts were still as flabby as ever, but this was a good thing.

When I touched her breasts with my entire palm, as if I were acclimating the ground, the lumpiness of her erect nipples felt really good.

"Mmm ......"

"ugh ...... ♡ Stop ...... messing with me ♡ Captain ......, why are you messing with me ...... ♡"

What man wouldn't want to mess with a girl who was panting in his arms? It was unthinkable in my poor imagination.

I kissed her skin, and kept caressing her.

I watch Lupetta's reaction, sometimes shaking as if she had been electrocuted, and try to find a good way to attack her. I'm going to develop her breasts, too.

Lupetta's voice became lower and lower as she gazed blankly at the ceiling, immersed in the joys of womanhood. Every time our lips met, her tongue seemed to increase in viscosity and heat.

It was an indescribable feeling of pleasure to wet my newly proposed daughter with my saliva. I feel as if I'm marking Lupetta as mine.

"Juruu...... huu............ ya, ya, ♡ stop...... stop...... I'm scared...... no, no......"

"What are you scared of?"

I know that Lupetta is always scared when she is about to climax.

I'll give her plenty of reassurance and let her drown at the bottom of the ocean of pleasure.

"You're beautiful, Lupetta. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I love you."

Lupetta is a woman who hungers for compliments.

He whispers her compliments and tells her how much he loves her. He held her hand, telling her that there was nothing to be afraid of, while appealing to her kindness.

"...scary...... ugh, ugh, ugh ♡ ♡ U...... ugh, noooo. Ugh ...... gentle, no ...... stop ...... and ...... I'll go crazy ......"

Lupetta, her voice becoming tearful, grabbed my leg firmly.

It was a very strong grip, probably because she wields a spear and sword on a regular basis, and she was clenching to endure the pleasure.

"Don't worry, you'll feel good. There's nothing to be afraid of."

This is where I deceive her with my sweet words. I spoke into her ear as if I were breathing on her.

"Yes...Yeah♡ Oh, yeah...♡-ha-ha♡"

"Yes, good girl. I'm not afraid. There's nothing wrong with Lupetta.

"Well...Ha...♡- -"

I silently accept Lupetta as she presses the back of her head against my chest.

I used both hands to press my hand against her pubic area and rubbed my fingers over her erect clit.

She lets out a concentrated gasp of pleasure and clings to my arm, begging me to caress her.

In response, I stimulated her pubic area, trying to satisfy her sexual desire.

"Hee-ahhhhhh ......♡ Aahhhh♡"

The next moment, a high-pitched scream pierced my eardrums, and Lupetta broke free.

She threw herself down on me limp and her silver eyes, moistened with tears, stared into the void.

"Hi...... ♡ Ahh ♡ Oh, no ♡ Fu...... ♡ Uu...... ♡ Uu...... ♡"

I looked down at her, breathless and lost in the afterglow of pleasure, as she lay back and opened her legs, her small breasts rising and falling in a huff.

I glanced at her crotch and noticed the hairs growing there.

Her pubic hair was soaked with her love juices and stuck to her skin, rippling like seaweed.

Although she is a little girl, Lupetta has a good amount of pubic hair. She may look like a girl, but her body is probably a grown woman.

"Hmm?"

As I tossed the clothes scattered on the bed toward the nearby sofa, I noticed one item of clothing that caught my attention.

It was Lupetta's jacket, and there seemed to be something in the pocket.

I wondered if she had a knife in there because she was an adventurer, so I casually took it out.

"...... razor blade?"

It was a razor blade in a long, thin wooden box.

The wooden box was about the size of a chopstick case attached to a lunch box in previous generations of Japan.

I wondered why there was such a thing, but the answer came to me immediately.

Lupetta had just told me that Melgen had asked her to marry him and she had received a razor blade. In other words, this must be a razor blade sent by Melgen.

I've heard that commoners sometimes send razor blades in marriage proposals, but this is the first time I've actually seen one.

"Shave your cunt with this for me!" The proposal of ...... is said to make the wombs of women on the continent of Eruo. It's an amazing value system.

"Hmmm. ......"

Looking at the blade, which seemed to cut well, a mischievous feeling welled up inside me.

"...... Captain......?"

"It's okay."

As I said this, I put my hands on Lupetta's legs and made her spread her legs from 60 degrees to 120 degrees.

In the aftermath of her climax, she spread her legs without any resistance and stared at me with vague, vacant eyes.

For someone with such a childish figure, her gesture was very sexy, and I felt a little aroused.

But in this way, Lupetta is still an adventurer, and her legs and waist are nicely toned and beautiful.

I held the razor blade up and pressed it against her lower abdomen and moved it.

The sound of the hair being cut came through my fingertips.

"Oh, ......?　What? What?"

"Don't move, or important part might get cut."

The fact that the blade is in her groin startles Lupetta and she tries to run away, but I hold her back.

In fact, if she were to move too far, he might cut the part of her body that she shouldn't.

Rupetta is an adventurer, so her injuries will probably heal quickly, but I don't enjoy cutting up girls.

"If you're going to be my wife, you'll have to shave well."

Married women, as well as girls who are engaged or planning to get married, must shave their pubic hair.

This is because there is a strange custom of shaving one's pubic hair in preparation for showing it only to one's husband.

Naturally, Lupetta, who had received a razor blade from Melgen, needed to shave.

"But,......, you can't look at it,......."

Lupetta's protests were muted, as if she thought I wouldn't stop anyway.

I continued shaving without paying any attention to her.

It seemed to be an expensive razor blade, and the sharpness was excellent.

"Don't look ......."

Her crotch, which should normally only be shown to Melgen, quickly became smooth and exposed for me to see.

It was a garden that I knew well, where my cock had already been in and out many times.

She was embarrassed, but Lupetta didn't seem too shocked. I'm not sure if it's because I've been in the same situation before, or if it's just the lingering effects of my climax that have left me unconscious.

"...... It's beautiful. I was the first one to see this place. Of course, I was the first to enter."

"Ugh."

"Lupetta, tell me, who was your first man?"

I was the one who took her virginity, I was the one who took her lips, and I was the one who first saw her pudgy cunt.

I took her virginity, I took her lips, and I was the first person to see her puffy pussy. Melgen even gave her a razor blade. ...... Well, I used that razor blade.

"Hiccup ......, Captain ...... is the first ......, man ......."

Lupetta admitted it, spilling a single tear.

"There is no need to cry. Yes, I'm Lupetta's first man. It's ......, and if anything happens to Lupetta, I'll make sure she's protected."

If anything happens to Lupetta, I will protect her.

"If Melgen doesn't like you, don't hesitate to come to me. Do you understand? I'll protect you all the way."

Showing myself to be a reliable man, I took her hand.

"And by the way, if Lupetta's favorite person turns out to be me and not Melgen, you can still come to me, okay?　Don't be shy."

"No, you won't. ......!　Melgen is the one I like ...... the most."

"Yeah, I guess you're right now. I'm talking about if, if."

That's the end of the story, I thought as I pressed my lips together.

 sucked her lips hard, sucked her tongue, and sucked her saliva out of her like a vacuum cleaner, hard enough to make it clear that I wanted Lupetta. I can feel Lupetta's nose getting ragged and sexy.

At the sound of her sweet voice, it seemed that my penis was finally at its limit.

My penis is erect and begging to enter her vagina, staining the area around Luppeta's waist with my juices.

My penis was whispering to me to leave my genes inside her.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 163 - A female adventurer who has just been asked to marry the man of her dreams (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I rotated Lupetta's body and placed her on my thighs. It was a face-to-face sitting position.

She is a small woman, but when she is in this pose, her face is on top of mine.

"I'm going inside Lupetta. ......"

With one hand on Lupetta's waist and the other on my penis, I began to search for an entrance.

"Aghhhh ♡"

My cock, now hard as iron, thrusts inside Lupetta's slick, wet vagina.

Pressing her chin against my shoulder and trembling like a small animal, Lupetta screamed like a female between resistance to the foreign sensation and pleasure.

"Oooh ...... that's good, Lupetta ......."

The woman's vagina, which was already too small for her own good, began to tighten up with a strong clenching sensation, delighting in the man's entrance after so long.

The rough texture, the hot body heat from long hours of caressing, and the increasingly viscous love juices sticky and tangled in the mucous membrane of my penis.

"Why, why♡ I don't like it ..."

I put my hands around Lupetta's waist and back to strengthen the contact.

　

'm not sure how to describe the comfort of skin-to-skin contact. My heart danced with the body heat that came directly from her skin, and her slightly sweaty back felt good in my hands.

Although I couldn't do the up and down pistoning motion because Lupetta was clinging to me and I couldn't move, I felt such a pleasant sensation that I almost ejaculated just by being joined.

"Haa...... haa......... ♡ Oh no......... Melgen......... Melgen......... hah♡ Ugh, I'm going crazy...... ♡ Scary........."

Lupetta moans in my ear, full of animalistic lust.

I could feel that she was desperately trying to hold back her pleasure, which was very endearing and stimulated my possessiveness.

"Come on, Lupetta."

She's a bad girl for calling out another man's name in bed. ....I said, and took her lips.

Because of the female dominant position, kissing her inevitably puts Lupetta's face up.

I used my tongue to pry her lips apart, and Lupetta's saliva dripped from them.

"Nchu...... chup...... churu......."

"Ah ...... chu...... n, chu. ...... puah, chue ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡."

The combination of my mouth and genitals, the upper and lower mucous membranes, gave me an unparalleled sense of unity. It was a strange and euphoric feeling, as if Lupetta and I had merged into one life.

When I extended my tongue and twirled it, my vulva tightened in response, seeking the seed of a child.

"It feels good to be inside ...... Lupetta."

"No, no, I don't...♡...♡"

I just want to stay connected to you. ......?"

I dipped my hand into the side of her ass and stimulated the area around her clitoris with my fingertips.

He danced his fingers in a circular motion and caressed her labia in a teasing manner.

"Oh, no, no, no, no!　♡♡♡♡♡♡"

I used my other hand to support Lupetta, who looked up at me as if she was going to fall over, and continued to caress her with my fingers.

She swayed as she moaned, almost like a scream.

"Oh no, .....♡, Me-Melgen ...... scary, scary!　Oh no, Melgen, you're the best. ...... Hii♡ Oh no, no, no ......♡"

The vagina also seems to be at its peak, and the vaginal walls come close together in an attempt to crush my penis for seed.

Lupetta struggles to escape the pleasure, but the up and down motion stimulates my penis.

And more than anything, Lupetta's desperate cries as she tries to hold on to her reasoning as she is drowning in the pleasure of a woman's body excites me intensely.

"Fuck, Lupetta, ......!　I'm going to come inside you.

"What?　Wait, wait, wait. ......♡ No!　No, no, no!　No, no, no, no, no!"

Even so, her body was begging for semen.

I put my arms around Lupetta's sides and secured her shoulders so that I could pour my seed deep into her.

I pulled her to me at once, pulled her hips back, and thrust my penis into her vagina.

"Aaahhhhhh, ♡!"

"It's coming out!　Take it!"

Sssss. Byuyu...

The erect penis hardened all at once, and then cum flew out with great force.

My sperm was expelled into the defenseless womb without the hindrance of birth control pills.

As if in response to the shudder of my ejaculation, her vagina clenched and contracted greedily in an attempt to get as many drops of seed as possible.

Lupetta must have climaxed too, because she let out a strange cry that made my ears itch, and clung to my back with her nails.

Perhaps it was because I hadn't been pistoning hard enough, but the ejaculation of semen that came out of me in a steady stream was sweetly seeded.

"Lupetta ......"

"Ta...... Captain......♡ ...... aguh.........♡"

We called out to each other, and our lips naturally met, without either of us initiating it.

My penis responded by continuing to ejaculate, shuddering and quivering, and I squeezed out more seed.

At this moment, Lupetta and I are nothing more than a male and female mating.

"Chu ... Churu ........., huh, huh ... uh ... gu ..."

"Chu Chu Chu ♡ Nhaa ... Chuuu, Chupu ... Chu, Pupua"

The ejaculation continued in small increments, and then it came to an end.

My heart fills with the satisfaction of having planted my seed in her body.

"Phew ......... phew, Lupetta ......."

Since I just ejaculating, it was troublesome to maintain the sitting position.

I put my hands around Lupetta's back and slowly lay her body down on the bed with my softening penis still connected to her.

She seemed to want to lie down as well, and the move was smooth.

"Chu. ...... Repetto, that was good."

I just fell backwards from the sitting position, so I was in the normal position.

My penis, which had been spewing out all the semen it could, was exhausted and was losing its hardness quickly.

However, it was still hard enough to penetrate her vagina as a valve to keep the semen from spilling.

As I leaned over her body, I kissed her lightly again and again.

It was so pleasant to take her lips in the afterglow of my ejaculation.

"Chuuu......n, which......?"

Lupetta looks at me with vacant eyes.

I took her hand, intertwined our fingers and squeezed them together.

"Is it heavy?"

"No, it's ...... not heavy.

"I see."

For a while after that, Lupetta and I stayed connected in silence.

Perhaps it was because Lupetta had such small breasts, but I could feel her heart beating when our breasts met.

I felt like falling asleep right then and there.

"Captain ......, sir."

"What's wrong?"

Lupetta looked like she was about to cry as she looked at me.

"...... Please ......." Lupetta says, shaking her shoulders.

"You can't tell ...... Melgen that I'm doing this."

Lupetta turns her face to the side.

I kiss the side of her face.

"Of course. I'll keep my promise."

"I believe in you, ...... captain."

The words and gestures were so cute that my cock hardened a little.

"You're a good girl. ...... chu."

"Mmm ...... chu ♡"

When our lips met, her tongue accepted mine without resistance.

Her tongue was soft and warm.

"Oh, no ...... again ......."

The cock that had been stinging me was all back again.

Lupetta seemed to be able to feel its erection as it expanded, pushing against the vaginal wall.

"It's because Lupetta is pretty. I'm dying to have a baby with Lupetta."

"Oh no. ......"

"I'm going to pour a lot of the nobleman's strong seed into her. Hmmm, do you think Melgen's sperm can win?"

As I was saying this, I raised myself up from my position on Lupetta and got into the normal position.

I had just ejaculated, so my penis was still sensitive. I moved my hips back and forth in a relaxed manner as if I were tasting Lupetta's vagina.

Lupetta was reluctant to say anything, but her resistance was weak.

She had already had one shot, so it was pointless to resist now.

"If you have a child with magical powers, just keep quiet and you won't know."

"U...... that's right, but ...... ah ♡"

It's not so strange that Lupetta and Melgen have a child with magical powers.

The fruit of my love for Lupetta is sure to be a child with magical powers, so as long as her face and hair color resemble Lupetta's, she will never be discovered.

When I think about it, I feel like a cuckoo begging for alms. I felt a sense of immorality, and it sent shivers down my spine.

"As long as Lupetta and I keep it a secret, there will be no problems. You can have my baby without worry. Do you understand?"

He kissed Lupetta when she tried to open her mouth, not allowing her to argue.

I'm going to get Lupetta pregnant.

I then proceeded to pour my seed into Lupetta over and over again until all that came out was clear juice.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 164 - Voistra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Voistra.

The name of this vast plain, located almost in the center of the continent, is said to derive from the ancient word Voithstola.

Voith means "wheat," and shtola means "to dye fabrics," which in turn means "to spread evenly.

As its etymology suggests, the Voith Plain is one of the most important grain-growing areas on the continent of Eruo.

The history of the Voistra Plain shows that it has long been under the control of several aristocratic families.

In the days when the Zethusian High Society boasted of its power, the nobles of each region could not maintain their independence without the approval of the Society. This meant that any rule that was not in the interests of the Zethusian Society could not be accepted.

Land boundaries were more often determined by the politics of the priests than by the power of the nobles.

There was no way that the Holy High Society would have approved of sole control of the Voistra Plain.

To allow a single noble family to rule a vast plain would be like sowing the seeds of disaster.

The emergence of a particularly strong territory outside of St. Navenpos was something that should be avoided. This was even more so when it came to noble families.

The basic policy of the Zesu Church was to have a strong St. Navenpos reign over a small aristocratic domain.

Thus, the Holy High Society divided the Voistra Plain into several sections, leaving each to a different noble family.

If one of the noble families were to attempt independence against the Holy High Society, they could unite the remaining noble families and crush them.

Looking back over history, it can be said that this policy worked effectively. At least until the authority of the Holy High Society decayed.

As time passed from priests to nobles, these old ruling structures also crumbled like corroded iron.

It was the priestly aristocratic Spiaseik family, the Spiaseik family, that achieved the unification of the Voistra Plain.

In the current continent of Eruo, there are two major groups of nobles: the native nobility and the priestly nobility.

The indigenous nobility is simply a family lineage that originated from the indigenous nobles who have ruled the region since ancient times. In contrast, priestly aristocrats are descended from high-ranking priests dispatched by St. Navenpos.

Indigenous aristocratic families are not immortal. Sometimes they die without children, and sometimes they are driven to extinction as a result of their rebellion against the Holy High Priesthood. Some of them are even welcomed into the house by the indigenous nobility to take in the advanced culture of St. Navenpos.

In general, indigenous noble families are uncertain about the origin of their ancestors, while priestly noble families often have solid historical records in their families because they are recorded in the Holy High Society and were originally priests of the intellectual class.

The Spiaseik were a typical priestly aristocrat family, as they originated from a high priest who was seconded from St. Navenpos about 350 years ago.

During the turbulent times that followed the papal uprising of 200 years ago, the then head of the Spiaseik family had ambitions to unite the Voistra Plain.

The power of the priests was weakened by the turmoil that had broken out in the heart of the Holy High Society. They no longer had the power to unite the numerous noble families scattered across the Voistra Plain.

In a sense, it was inevitable that the Spiaseik family, which had the major city of Ocellaria, won the battle.

It was a time when it was not unusual for priestly nobles to conspire with priests to gain supremacy.

After winning the Voistra Plain, the Spiaseik made a political statement to the entire continent.

It was to change the name of the family.

This was a useful means of dispelling the diminutive image of the Spiaseik family as "one of the various aristocratic families that existed here and there on the Voistra Plain," and of demonstrating to the rest of the world that they were the sole rulers of the Voistra Plain.

In later years, this technique was imitated by many aristocratic families. The aristocratic family that united the Aterahan region changed its name to Aterahan, following the success of the Spiaseik family.

Thus, the Voistra family, a great noble family that has left its mark on history, appeared on the continent of Eruo.

The Spiaseik, who had gained strength by unifying the plains,...... the Voistra family, did not let their momentum wane as they expanded westward.

West of the Voistra Plain was a mountainous region, dotted with a number of small and medium-sized noble families.

The Voistra family was able to subjugate these weak noble houses, which continued to fight over a small area of land in a joyless, mud-slinging contest.

It took about 20 years to unify the Voistra Plain and about two years to subjugate all the noble families in the mountainous region, and the Voistra family grew quickly.

Eventually, the Voistra family declared the founding of a new state and took the name of the royal family in order to establish a complete aristocratic system of rule.

This was the birth of the Kingdom of Voistra.

The Vostro royal family was later forced to rethink its course of expansion when it expanded its territory beyond the Leishleif region.

The main reason was that the rapid increase in territory had resulted in a shortage of knights.

Since there was no point in increasing land that could not be managed, the decision was made to steer the course toward stabilizing the territory by fertilizing the lands that had already been annexed.

The kingdom of Voistra was protected by a natural defensive position with mountains to the west, a major river to the east and south, and a curtain of mountain ranges to the north.

The only hole through which a large army could pass was the Leishleif area, a large break in the northern mountain range.

The Voistlanders therefore devoted their resources to strengthening the defenses of the Leishleif area and built the Leishleif Castle, an impregnable fortress complex unparalleled in history.

If the turbulent times in the western part of the continent had continued as they were, the Voistra Kingdom could have become the western champion.

However, the era chose a man who opened up a path of blood and ran through the never-ending turbulent times, the Emperor Zinkhaen.

The Voistra royal family, having learned of Emperor Zinkhaen's power during the siege of Leishleif Castle, soon gave up on maintaining the kingdom and surrendered.

At this time, he sent his daughter as a bride to strengthen his ties with the emperor's family, and then made a successful transition as a nobleman of the Zinkhaen Empire.

Furthermore, the Voistra family went to the trouble of reverting to the family name in order to show the emperor Zinkhaen that they no longer had ambitions, and to appeal to his obedience.

Thus was born the Dukes of Spierzeik, the Zinkhaen Imperial nobility that continues to this day.

Just as the Quardenze family's coat of arms is designed with a serpent entwined with a crossed spear and the spray of a great river, the Spiaseik family had its own coat of arms.

Although the family name has changed, the coat of arms that represents the family, the Spiaseik crest, has never changed.

"Its design can be found at ......."

"The wheat and sickle with the ears hanging almost touching the ground. A single-edged vine tilted at an angle. ......There's no doubt about it, it's the flag of the House of Spierzeik."

"Damn it, how did I get here?"

The two men, who had hidden themselves in the bushes on the small cliff, made small venomous grunts at the ground.

The army advancing on the mountain path below did not notice the men, but marched on at a leisurely pace. The large military banner in the middle of the road had the Spiaseik crest painted on it.

It was the army led by a nobleman, the Lord's Army.

"The men who were guarding this area were killed by that thing?"

"I doubt it."

The red-eyed man sputters out a few words to himself, and the blue-eyed man chimes in.

Their status is that of soldiers of the Quardenze family. They are usually active as foot soldiers stationed at the frontline base that is locked in a standoff with the old Voistra.

There was a reason why they were moving far away from the base in the mountains.

"They are moving in the direction ...... of the city of Nambonan. This makes it impossible to call for reinforcements. Oh no, General Galfis is on his way to ......."

"Hey, relax. No general gets hit that easily."

It all started on the third day of the new year. The old Voistra's army invaded the outpost.

From the old Voistra's point of view, the frontline base of the Quardenze army was nothing more than a bump on the eye. So fighting was a common occurrence, and at first the soldiers at the base even laughed it off as a "New Year's greeting.

The army, however, was of an unprecedented scale.

Not only the Spierzeik family, the old Voistra's allies, but also their descendants, the aristocratic families, were pouring into the base in large numbers. And among them, there were a few nobles.

A large number of soldiers, knights, and nobles. These concentrated attacks plunged the frontline base into an unprecedented battle.

Against the old Voistra, which had thrown in a considerable number of forces, the commander, Quardenze Galfis, decided to request reinforcements from the city of Nambonan.

They were chosen to serve as messengers.

"I think we should split up from here. I thought it was a waste to let us be the messengers, but the general's intuition is right on the money. Indeed."

It would have been unthinkable under normal circumstances to use two follower soldiers to serve as messengers inside one's own territory, let alone in enemy territory. It would be even more unthinkable if they were attacked by a large army and were short of troops.

However, Galfis sensed something fishy about the old Voistlander's movements and decided to move his valuable retinue.

"......Yes, that's right. The sun will be setting in a few more hours, and we'd better go for the city of Nambonan as fast as we can under the cover of darkness."

The reason the two of them were working together was to avoid a one-on-one situation in case they met the followers' enemies along the way.

This was because it was not possible to ensure victory in a one-on-one fight, and even if they were able to defeat the enemy, they would not be able to fulfill their mission satisfactorily if they were wounded.

However, they decided that if the main ancestor's enemies were present, they would have a better chance of survival if they scattered and ran rather than if they were poorly organized.

They were also concerned about the battle at the frontline base, but Galfis, who had fought a hundred battles, was there. However, there are no nobles in Nambonan City. Whatever the course of action, it would be bad if the information was not conveyed quickly.

"Before we split up, let's share some information about each other."

"Yeah, it would be a problem if only one of us made it there, you or me."

Watching the enemy advance, the men exchange words, believing that they will meet again in Nambonan City.

The presence of the nobles means that there is no mistaking the presence of follower soldiers deployed around them to protect them. If they are caught in their watch list, they will die.

After a quick review of the situation, the blue-eyed man muttered quietly, "I'm not sure I believe it, but I'm sure I'm not alone.

"......This time around, I don't think the old Voistra's goal is to destroy the frontline base."

"Odd, isn't it? I think so too."

"What's the reason?"

"They are marching too fast. Even if it is an army led by a nobleman, they don't advance so quickly through enemy territory."

The Lord Ancestor's magical power is powerful anyway, and it is extremely useful in military operations.

By applying physical enhancement magic to an army of more than tens of thousands at once, it is possible to realize a marching speed several times faster than that of a normal army.

In addition to the high firepower of the ancestor's individual soldiers, the high mobility of the general soldiers would also be a powerful weapon in the ancestor's army.

However, its strength would be demonstrated mainly in defensive battles in its own territory.

Nobles who charge into enemy territory, where they do not know where the enemy's eyes or traps may be, are extremely rare and in the minority.

"Indeed, it is not like General Galfis."

"Right?"

In a sense, this is a familiar sight to those who have seen Galfis up close and personal, who will not hesitate to charge single-handedly when he sees an opportunity.

However, in all the long battles they had fought, no Spierzeik family members had ever made such a maneuver. In other words, the presence of this enemy army is unusual.

I think the Spierzeiks may have been the head and moved the centipede's legs," he said. They're local, they know the area.

The blue-eyed man says that it is highly possible that the Spierzeiks family manipulated the legs of the centipede, the knightly family members who lost their way of life after their master was killed. ......

Although the Quardenze family is currently the ruler of the area, the land was ruled by another noble family until a few years ago. Some of the local commoners may still cooperate with them.

The centipede legs that have been lurking in various places as the Spierzeiks family executes its plan will tell them what the Quardenze army is up to and guide them along the way. From their point of view, it was someone else's territory that they knew all too well.

I don't know how long they have been working together, but they may have been acting as scouts for some time. They may have been acting as scouts for some time, just for this day.

'You deadbeat bastards. When your heads are crushed, get the hell out of here."

The red-eyed man says as if to spit.

The blue-eyed man shared his words, but continued with his thoughts.

"My hunch is that this is a maneuver to take out General Galfis."

"Are you serious?"

"I wouldn't say that as a joke."

The blue-eyed man continues, looking down at the Spierzeik soldiers who continue to march in formation.

He continued, looking down at the Spiaseik soldiers who were still marching in formation.

"There is an abundance of wealth there, and if we can make it our base, it will be difficult to get reinforcements from the interior."

"......, so we're cut off?"

Even if reinforcements come from the interior, we can't win with just our foot soldiers. Nobles against nobles. But it is too dangerous to cross the river with the enemy's nobles waiting on the other side.

The ship could easily be sunk.

"Ah."

A boat leisurely crossing a river is a good summary from the point of view of our ancestors.

It is necessary to eliminate the danger on the other side of the river in order to get the nobles on board, even if they are mere soldiers.

"If we don't get reinforcements from the interior, we're in for an endless war.　Even now, we're outnumbered at the base, and the old Voistra guys can bring in as many troops as they want from their territory. ....."

It was a big operation for a maneuver to take down just one general, but the red-eyed man felt it was possible.

The Quardenze family's rapid advance was largely due to Galfis' hand, and defeating him would certainly be a turnaround.

If they could defeat Galfis, who was also known as the "red devil," the Spierzeik family's reputation as a warrior would be raised at a stroke.

There was a good chance that the imperial aristocratic families that had supported the Quardenze family would turn their backs on them.

"Let's work as a messenger to make sure that doesn't happen. It will be a battle to see how much time we can buy in Nambonan City."

"I agree. Let's take this opportunity to check it out."

"It is not the job of a messenger to speculate," the red-eyed man says lightly, and returns to the task of checking on the Spierzeik soldiers.

It is not possible to check the entire army at once on the mountain road, but if they move around poorly, they may be found. Therefore they kept hiding in place for a while.

"The number of ...... troops is about 30,000 ......50,000?　What do you think?"

"It's hard to count. ...... Well, I don't think it's more than 40,000."

Looking at the Spierzeik soldiers, they discuss the number of troops.

This is an important estimate, as the army is about to approach the city of Nambonan.

Of course, there are a lot of knightly banners.

The number of engineers is not less than 5,000. At this rate, they must have put in a lot of foot soldiers as well.

"Oh, man."

They had noticed that although the number of soldiers was modest, they were of good quality.

There seemed to be no mistake in assuming that this was a strategy to capture the city of Nambonan in one fell swoop with a small number of elite soldiers.

"The speed of the advance is very fast. If we continue at this pace, we will reach Nambonan City in two or three days."

"We're about a day away from a serious run, so it looks like we'll be ready for a day or two. ......"

"We're going to have to ask the general to hang on a little bit longer. Let's hope reinforcements arrive early from the interior."

The two recited the contents of the last message, said their goodbyes, and mounted their horses.

They made a wide detour around the advancing Spierzeik forces, each heading for the city of Nambonan.

"Report."

The room was filled with a strange silence.

The man who spoke the low words was the military officer in charge of the troops stationed in Nambonan City. He is the next head of the Gatoren family of knights, and just recently turned 40 years old.

One of the military officers responded to the commander's voice, stood up on the spot, and opened his mouth.

"Sir!　Spierzeik's forces began deploying in the western part of the city. A general assault is expected to come at sunrise."

The unspoken sound of a snarl, a mixture of preparedness and nervousness, echoed through the room.

Two days had passed since the man with the message, the man with the red eyes, had flown into Nambonan City. The blue-eyed man still had not arrived.

The Nambonan garrison was hastily arming up and getting into position to intercept the Spierzeik forces.

The headquarters of the garrison was also temporarily moved to a conference room in the mayor's mansion.

"Any change in overall command?"

No sign of backing down. The Spiaseik crest is red with a yellow background, and Spiaseik Verret is in overall command.

When nobles run an army, they use their family's coat of arms as a military banner, but the design varies from general to general.

Only the current head of the family can use the official family crest, but a simplified version of it can be used by anyone other than the head of the family.

In the case of the Spierzeik family, a simplified red and yellow flag is known as the flag used by the next head of the family.

Spiaseik Verret.

The eldest son of the Spiaseik family head was the general of the Nambonan raid.

After the military officers made some reports, they were asked to be seated by the commanding officer.

The reports were merely a summary of what had already been confirmed many times.

Most of the military commanders had already gone out to the field to prepare their troops, and the only people in this room, the headquarters, were the executive-level military commanders and the debriefing staff.

No particular progress has been made since Spierzeiks army, numbering about 38,000 troops, appeared in the western part of Nambonan City last night.

The number of Quardenze troops defending Nambonan City is currently about 64,000. Looking at the simple number of soldiers, the Quardenze side has the advantage, but there is not a single main ancestor among them.

In addition, there were a number of martial knight banners on the Spierzeik side, so even in terms of the number of squires, it was impossible to say for sure that they had the upper hand.

"I have a report."

In response to the young military officer who raised his hand and asked to speak, the commander silently moved his chin.

The young officer raised his hand and said, "Ladies, your transfer to the interior has been completed without incident."

"Thank you. But we need to launch the ship one more time. The river must be kept on the alert. Miss Anna is the young man's favorite. We must get her out of there before we run out of time."

When the military was informed that Spierzeik's forces were approaching, they immediately made a decision.

It was to evacuate Wilke's beloved women to the interior.

The fall of the city of Nambonan, and the fact that Wilke's beloved women would become the consolation prize of Spierzeik's soldiers, was to be avoided at all costs. If Wilke became impotent from the mental shock, the future of the territory would be bleak.

For this reason, the military officers evacuated Kohari, Rave, Tico, and the other women living in the house to the interior, beyond the reach of the enemy, in other words, to the other side of the great river.

This young military officer was in charge of transporting them and had just returned to the city of Nambonan.

"We will continue to be vigilant and watch out for the river!"

The young military officer bowed briskly and continued after prefacing his words with the words, "The information is uncertain."

I heard on my way back here that the Galiana family has attacked the Quardenze family.

"What?"

The army led by the head of the House of Galiana has invaded the interior.

The new information, and the bad news at that, created an atmosphere of disquiet in the room, and the military officers turned to each other with hardened expressions on their faces.

The commanding officer quelled the clamor with a small tap on his desk.

"Go on."

"Ha. ...... But the soldier who told the story didn't seem to have any detailed information either, other than that he didn't have any ....... I'm sorry, but that's all I can ...... tell you at the moment."

The young military officer shrank back to the point of looking pitiful as he was now being stared at by every military officer in the room.

Why didn't you come back after confirming the authenticity of the report, you coarse man, his superior, a senior military officer, lamented.

Deciding that he had nothing more useful to report, the commanding officer allowed him to leave, and he fled the room as if to escape.

'...... things don't look good.'

Cutting through the silence, one of the military officers spoke up.

Then, as if pulled by his voice, the other military officers spoke their opinions one after another.

The commander listened quietly as the military officers began to speak excitedly, and then spun his words in a calm tone.

"We are the vassals of Quardenze."

At the sound of his voice, the military officers calm their voices and silently wait for him to continue.

A stern silence envelops the entire room.

"There is only one thing to do, and that is to protect this land."

The military officers responded to the commander's words by bowing in unison without speaking.

In the absence of instructions from the Quardenze family, the best they could do was to protect the city of Nambonan.

It is a shame to be misled by uncertain information. Being military officers of the highest rank, all of them immediately returned to being calm.

"We have sent a message to New Nellie, and in two days the instructions, if not the reinforcements, will reach them. Then we will do our duty. Good."

"Ha! ha!" the military officers said, this time in unison.

The commander grumbled, as if this was the end of the military discussion.

"It's a shame the ...... draft didn't go ahead."

The commander's words make everyone all look bitter.

The Nambonan retinue had sent horses to recruit men from neighboring villages, but they had all failed to turn up.

"It seems that the city of Nambonan is not to be trusted. Because they were tricked into recruiting soldiers last time, many of them think they will be tricked again this time."

The commander was answered by the military officer who had just reprimanded the young officer.

The battle for the city of Nambonan by the Quardenze allied forces was several months ago.

On that occasion, the Nambonan Council had gathered soldiers from neighboring villages and pitted them against the coalition of aristocrats. As a result, a large number of villagers died or became slaves.

This was resented, and many fled from the Quardenze conscripts in large numbers, gripped by fear at the display of the power and terror of the aristocracy.

In a sense, it was cause and effect.

After the meeting, most of the senior military officers made a short run to the field. Only a few remained at headquarters.

The commander, feeling thirsty, said he would leave the room and then left the conference room.

"The kid over there."

"Ha, yes!"

The commander called out to the back of a boy who was walking impatiently down the hallway of the mayor's mansion.

"Are you the one who works here?　What's your name?"

"I'm Kianes!　I work here!"

To the rugged, stern-faced commander, Kianes curtsies awkwardly, trembling with nervousness. He had been persistently taught by his room-mate that it was important to be polite to the higher-ups.

Kianes has come to the mayor's mansion to help the city officials with their chores, which have become busy during this time of war.

His sister, Tico, was evacuated to the interior, but Kianes happened to be on an errand and could not make it aboard.

"Can I help you?"

The armor-clad commander was nothing but a scary adult in Kianes' eyes.

The commander frowned at Kianes's high-pitched voice and ordered him to bring water.

Kianes paced back and forth down the hallway as if he were running away from the commander and brought a goblet filled with water.

"He brought it to ......."

It was at that very moment that Kianes presented the goblet to the commander.

Suddenly, a chill ran through him, and his whole body shivered. The goblet in his hand fell to the floor, and the water it contained spread throughout the hallway.

He was so shocked, he thought, "Hi ......!　Hi......!"

As it was, Kianes fell to his knees into the hallway, his vision darkening in horror as he opened his eyes.

It was as if a mass of malice had been forced down his throat, and its black filth was coursing through his entire body. Everything from Kianes's skin to his organs was nauseated.

"Calm down."

'Hi ............!　Hiiii......!　Ugh, ugh ......!　Ggh!　Ububu......"

The commander launched a light healing spell at Kianes, who was vomiting and spreading vomit all over the floor.

The effect was immediate, and Kianes calmed his breathing.

'Oh ...... that ......?　Hey, what the hell, now ......"

Don't you know. This is the will of the Lord Ancestor to kill."

It is a kind of magical release.

Unlike magic power, which is pure energy with nothing in it, magic power with emotion in it spreads around like ripples on the surface of water.

In particular, emitting magic power with a strong aggressive intent to kill is an act of intimidation by the ancestors.

It was said that if an ordinary nobleman emitted magic power with full force and directionality, it could reach up to two or three kilometers away.

It is difficult for a commoner to sense normal magic, but when blended with the spice of murderous intent, even a commoner can sense it.

And the killing intent amplified by the magical power envelops the commoner in fear.

The weak-minded, those unaccustomed to intimidation, and those with little fighting spirit are rendered immobilized by this surge of killing intent and stop fighting.

Commoners who receive this threat for the first time invariably fall into a state of panic, causing vomiting, hyperventilation, fainting, etc. The current Kianes is a good example.

One of the reasons for the Lord's troubles was this widespread desire to kill.

"It takes courage to overcome the Lord's will to kill," he said. As Miss Anna said, it is not difficult if you have the passion to protect this city. Remember that well."

The beginning of the intimidation means that the battle is on.

The commander left a stunned Kianes sitting on the floor and went straight back to his headquarters.

Chapter 165 - Evil Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was dressed up in the waiting room for the entertainment at the New Year's party.

The knightly families from all over the territory have gathered at New Nellie Castle to greet the New Year.

It was two days ago that all the knights in the service of the Quardenze family had gathered, and today the banquet had begun in the morning.

"How is the condition of your neck? Is it painful?"

"I'm fine."

"This armor was actually used by Master Cassia. Please be aware of it."

The main event of the day is the one trick show that each of us, Fanny and I, perform.

This year, my performance is a one-woman show called "The Red Devil and the Princess Goryohime," a play based on an old tale of my grandmother and grandfather. I play two or three roles by myself, but basically I play the grandmother's role.

I didn't have a particular costume in mind, but Tesh took the trouble to prepare armor from the warehouse for me.

It was a little awkward to use such a relic for a banquet performance, but my father had given me permission to do so, and I couldn't say no to the old servants who were peacefully telling me stories about my grandmother's past while they were taking care of the armor.

'Ah. I understand."

Since the shape of the armor does not change between women's and men's, people will not think I am a crossdresser even if I wear it.

If it had been game-style bikini armor, I would have been a complete pervert.

I thought it would be small, but it's surprisingly wearable.

This armor was apparently worn by my grandmother when she was still young, around early elementary school age in prehistoric Japan.

Each part seems to be divided into smaller pieces, and thanks to the servants who adjusted it to my body shape, I was able to put it on without too much difficulty. If I were on my own, I would never have been able to put it on, and it would have been difficult to take it off.

Fortunately, I did not know my grandmother's face, so the perverse act of wearing the girl's armor barely gave me an erection. It was a close call.

I have prepared a substitute for the treasured sword. Please take this one.

It seems that the props used in the play were as good looking as the armor.

One of the servants, holding a sword in both hands, kneels down on one knee and offers it to us with his arms outstretched like a school principal handing out a certificate of merit.

The sheath of the treasure sword has a mosaic pattern of alternating pale blue, blue-green, and white minerals embedded in it, and the picture of a snake expressed in an abundance of bright jade is quite a sight to behold.

It looked as if a snake was swimming on the surface of the water, which reflected the sunlight and glistened.

"Is this a water snake?"

"Yes. I prepared this for you because I thought it would fit your story."

Water snakes are a form of folklore widely believed in and around New Nellie City.

It is a fairy tale about a snake that swims up a large river to reach a mountain that rises upstream. Eventually, the snake reached the top of the mountain, where it is said to have transformed into a serpent with powerful magical powers.

The sheath of this treasure sword seems to be made in the motif of a serpent fighting against the torrent of a great river.

When I put my hand on the scabbard to check if there was any design on the sword body, the door was opened.

The door was opened and I was about to check if there was any design on the blade when the door was opened. I am sorry, but please come to the hall immediately.

As soon as he entered the room, Tesh said so and had the wardrobe attendant's servant stand back. From his appearance, I could tell that this was an urgent call.

I wondered if I should take off my armor, but it had taken me an hour to put it on.

The fact that Tesh had the wardrobe mistress down means that there was no time to spare to change. I decide that it's better to just keep going.

"I'm going to go. I'll be right there."

I leave the small room for changing and walk down the hallway at a quick pace. Perhaps it was the unfamiliarity of my armor, but I was out of tune, and the sound of metal scraping against metal was grating on my ears.

I don't know what the call is about, but I don't think Tesh has heard the details either. I remained silent and followed Tesh's lead.

"Excuse me, sir," he said. "I have brought the young master with me."

Although a banquet was supposed to be going on in the hall from the morning, the lively atmosphere characteristic of a drinking party could not be felt from the other side of the door.

I felt my heart beat a little faster at the quietness of the room.

I go in.

When I stepped into the hall, the smell of the military filled the air.

My father and a knight are sitting around a long desk placed in the center of the spacious room with difficult expressions on their faces.

The knight's family members who would have been with him seemed to have already left the room. All that remained were the current knight and an old retired former knight.

Perhaps because they were in the middle of a banquet, the knights were dressed in neat, military-like clothes.

"Father, is there something wrong?"

A couple of old men's eyes widened when they saw me.

I wondered what in the world they were surprised about, but I guess they realized that the armor I was wearing belonged to my grandmother. I felt their eyes were not on my face, but a little lower down, on my armor.

The armor was similar in shape, but different enough in design to identify the individual. No wonder some of the older generation remember their grandmother's armor.

'Wilk come here."

I follow his words and take the seat that is conveniently left open for me, facing my father.

As soon as I sat down, the knight sitting next to me opened his mouth.

"The territory of Evenapis has been attacked. A message was received earlier today, and a report has just been sent to the castle."

"I see."

Even though it was just after the new year, the Evenapis family, which is also my mother's family, was apparently attacked by another family.

The Evenapis territory has enemies to the west and south. That area is crowded with a large number of halfway independent noble families that do not belong to either the Kingdom of Levith or the Jinkaen Empire.

"Could it be that the western part of the region, which has been stretched thin by the absence of the knights, was attacked?"

I look at my father and I pose the question.

Just as the knights of the territory are currently gathered in the city of Newbery, the knights of the territory of Evenapis gather in the city where they are based during this time of the year.

The city of Haritos, the home of the Evenapis family, is located in the eastern and southernmost part of the territory, so the western side of the territory will be thin on the ground this time of year.

"The invasion will come from the west and the south at the same time."

My father answered shortly. That meant that more than one noble family had attacked the Evenapis family.

Even independent forces can join hands or flip-flop when their interests coincide.

Due to the spread of a strange disease caused by the magical beast Elsinia, the Evenapis family is currently in a situation that could be called a windfall.

The reason why they have not been invaded by independent forces until now is due to their alliance named the Kingdom of Levios and their strong relationship with the Silopeia and Quardenze families in the north.

"In the west, the enemy's main ancestral army has already crossed the border and entered. To the south, fighting seems to be going on in the city of Haritos, but fortunately, the enemy forces have only been confirmed to be mainly knights."

As if to continue his father's words, one of the knights made a supplementary comment.

"In light of what he said, there is a strong possibility that the noble families on the west and south sides are working hand in hand. It would be a direct advance by the nobles because they are convinced that the Evenapis family members cannot come to the west side."

Considering the strength of the territory, it is not difficult to repel one or two independent forces with the military strength of the Evenapis family. However, the longer it takes, the more exhausted they will become, and above all, it may trigger a rush of other independent noble families to join the war.

As allies of the Quardenze family, it would be better to send out reinforcements and cooperate in the early crushing.

"What do you think?"

In response to my father's question, I tell him my thoughts.

"I think that if we send reinforcements from Quardenze, we can kick them out early."

The problem is the main ancestral army coming from the west, but considering the number of soldiers, I think this too can be kicked out without the nobles having to leave.

Since the geographical advantage is on the side of Evenapis, the enemy nobles will flee back to their own territory if the number of troops is reduced to some extent. Defense and invasion are different.

"Hmm."

"...... and I am sure the enemy is well aware of that. There may be some other movement, and we should explore the surrounding area while preparing reinforcements."

Even if there were no alliance, there is no way that the small noble families could defeat the martial Evenapis family even if they joined forces somewhat.

Ironically, it is the independent noble families who have been exposed to the violence of the Evenapis family for many years that understand this the most.

It's the beginning of the year and the knights are away, so let's attack them. I don't think there are any fools who think optimistically that if they are lucky, they will get the territory ....... If there were, I would like to ask them how they have been able to maintain their independence until now.

"In other words, there must be some kind of scenario that will lead to victory in this invasion."

My father affirmed my statement, still looking as difficult as ever.

It seems that my father also suspects that there is something behind this invasion.

"I already know something," he said. "There was an uproar in the Galiana household."

"The Galiana family?"

It seems that some members of the family who were unhappy with the current head of the family have rebelled against him. There are many Aterahan-leaning families there, and they probably moved to eliminate him before he could consolidate his position in the capital in the spring.

The Galiana family was part of the Quardenze allied forces in the Battle of Nambonan City.

If the spring comes as it does, the Galiana family will be completely recognized as a Levios Kingdom Quardenze noble family. Although it may be too late for them, this winter is their last chance to escape.

And because of his commoner background, Viscount Galiana has been taken lightly within the Galiana family, so it is not surprising that there are those who are considering eliminating him, whether they actually do so or not.

It is a pity that Viscount Galiana was killed in a silly power struggle, because he was an aristocrat and a good man who understood what he was talking about.

If he survived, I wonder if he could be hired as an official merchant of the Quardenze family or as my commercial advisor. It would be impossible to have a male ancestor who is not related to me by blood.

"Is Viscount Galiana safe?"

"I have been aware of the discord in the family for some time, and I have taken refuge in Quardenze with my own forces. Read this."

My father tossed the letter and it glided across the desk to me.

I skimmed it over and read it quickly. "I'm sorry to just barge in. A member of my family has rebelled, and I was wondering if you would be willing to help the Quardenze family. As the rightful head of the Galiana family, I fully accept the intervention of the Kuordenze family." ......

The text could be interpreted as the Galiana family's vassalage to the Quardenze family.

I wonder if it is a characteristic of the Nambonan merchants that they do not simply get up when they fall. ......

"I've been consulting with you for some time now."

Viscount Galiana had the idea of placing more importance on the Quardenze family than on the Aterahan family, and we could see that he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to get closer to them at once.

As can be seen from the current five noble families of the Kingdom of Levios, the current era of miscellaneous noble families will soon come to an end. I have heard that Viscount Galiana also has similar thoughts.

Viscount Galiana may be thinking of consolidating his position as the oldest member of the faction by quickly vassalizing the Quardenze family.

Considering his skillful evacuation and his villainous face, it is strange that the rebellion seems to be Viscount Galiana's strategy.

"It is hard to believe that the entire Galiana family plotted the rebellion without any plan," he said. There are too many followers in Galiana Milord's hands, and she will not be defeated so easily.

If one wanted to easily succeed in the rebellion, it would be an essential requirement to defeat the Viscount Galiana within Galiana territory.

If he is killed in his own territory, he can be silenced as much as he wants, and no matter who becomes the new head of the family, it is like non-interference in internal affairs ...... non-interference within the family, and the other families cannot complain.

But that can be more difficult than it seems.

As my father said, Viscount Galiana has a very large number of follower soldiers as his pawns. The reason is simple: Viscount Galiana is a slut.

Among the main ancestors, the main ancestor born between a slave and a slave ancestor, that is, a child born with the blessing of a spirit, has a strong sexual desire. It would be more accurate to say that they have a sex drive on par with that of ordinary men.

Naturally, they do whatever they want to do, and they can do what they want to do.

I couldn't decide if this was serious or a joke, but Viscount Galiana told me that he had never performed a hand job in his life. He is a man full of romance whose spigot is always inside a woman.

The squires in Viscount Galiana's hands are, in essence, children he has made by having women here and there. With such a large number of guards, it would not be difficult for him to escape from Galiana's territory.

If he missed it, that would be the end of it. No nobleman would support a Galiana like a renegade vassal. Especially the head of the House of Aterahan.

The Aterahan family values righteousness, so it is not ...... that they will not accept a rebel who goes against reason, such as the expulsion of the head of the family.

As with any aristocratic family, to allow or support the banishment of the head of the family is to sow the seeds of disaster in one's own family. Where there are many family members and relatives, disaffected elements may be activated.

Unless the head of the family is a dark lord who cannot exterminate magical beasts and spreads misfortune to the surrounding area, he will not be recognized so easily.

In order not to destroy the house by the boomerang theory, it is unlikely that a rebel will be recognized while there is a legitimate head of the family.

"...... Even if the other house were to recognize the rebel, it would be after the dust has settled."

Even if recognized, it would be limited to cases where the rightful head of the family abandoned his attempt to regain his position or failed to return for an extended period of time, thus solidifying the rebel's effective control.

It is very difficult to say whether this is really possible.

If the Quardenze family, which has the cause of helping the unjustly chased Galiana family head, makes a move, the surrounding noble families of the Quardenze faction will also move in tandem.

The city of Avraur, the Galiana family's stronghold, would soon fall.

If they were to plot a rebellion, they would also have to consider what to do if they missed Viscount Galiana.

"Does this mean that the invasion of the Evenapis territory and the disturbances in the Galiana family could be linked?"

"It is not impossible. But it's a very poor idea on its own. You can't even call it a plan."

With the power of the Quardenze family, it is not impossible to deal with those two problems simultaneously. It is not a matter of stalling.

"It would be much more realistic for Galiana Milord, pretending to be exiled by her family members, to move to invade the interior of Quardenze."

"Indeed, my father is right, there is even a possibility that Viscount Galiana will betray the Quardenze family."

The local knights and soldiers, including the nobleman's army led by a large number of followers, must be tense.

The father exhaled and left the rest of the explanation to the knights.

The most pressing issue was the countermeasure against the invasion of the Evenapis family, and the conversation proceeded with the idea of preparing reinforcements for the time being.

In particular, it was important to deal with the main ancestral army that had entered the western part of the city, and the Galiana family disturbance did not require such an urgent response.

With all the knights in attendance, the military discussions proceeded smoothly.

The basic policy was for the knight families in the southern part of the Quardenze territory to form an army and suppress the enemy in concert with the local Evenapis army.

It was at the stage where they had to gather troops for reinforcements.

A loud "Come in" was heard from the other side of the door, and one of the military officers entered the hall as if he had fallen down.

"Urgent news!　General Galfis, you are now engaged with the old Voistra's main ancestral army!　At the same time, a detachment is approaching Nambonan City!　The general of the detachment is Spiaseik Verret!　This is the Army of the Lords, too!"

Everyone in the room, except me and my father, was a knight or former knight, so the news didn't cause a stir like the rest of the small army.

Rather, an ear-splitting silence enveloped the room. I looked at the military officer with such attention that I stared at him and kept my mouth shut.

"Go on."

When my father threw a low voice to cut through the silence, the military officer straightened his posture, raised his voice, and continued his report.

He said that at the frontline base, my grandfather was engaged with several main ancestral forces of the former Voistra, and that another unit of the Spiaseik family was approaching the city of Nambonan.

According to the military officer, the battle at the frontline base, which began on January 3, is expected to be still ongoing today, January 7, and the city of Nambonan may have already started fighting depending on the advancing troops.

When the report was over, the military officer collapsed and fell to the ground, as if he had lost strength from having accomplished his role.

His dingy clothes and facial expression indicated that he had ridden his horse through the night.

Even so, it was a very early arrival for a messenger from Nambonan City. It was a good thing that I had instructed them to strengthen the communication network within the territory in response to Rumon's recommendation.

My father did not try to hide his grim expression as he exhaled deeply and muttered to himself, "I am glad that we have decided to strengthen the communication network in the territory in response to Rumon's recommendation."

"I have no doubt that ...... Spierzeig's scheme is a good one."

The invasion against the Evenapis, the rebellion of the Galiana family, and the massive counter-offensive campaign against the Quardenze territory.

My father was convinced that the Spiaseik were behind all of this.

The Galiana family, which has discord within the family, "will not have time to interfere with the Quardenze family if they rebel in line with us.

To the independent forces hostile to the Evenapis family, he said, "If you invade with us, the Quardenze will not be able to send reinforcements."

The Quardenze family's influence was weakened as a result, a development that was desirable for the old Voistra, even though it showed advantage to the other side.

The financial problems of the old Voistra, as mentioned by Rumon, would be relieved if they could loot the city of Nambonan.

The fact that they once called themselves a royal family was no joke. It was a very devious strategy.

"It is urgent that we reinforce General Gulfis, ...... father ......" he said. This is our first priority.

The knights reply in unison. Their voices were full of urgency.

"It is not good for the city of Nambonan to be taken now. Rouse the army as soon as possible, ASAP."

"Ha!"

Each knight straightens his back and waits for the next instruction from his father.

"Evenapis," he said, "but we will only reinforce the city of Haritos. Command is at ......."

For the Quardenze family, abandoning the Evenapis family in their crisis would be bad for their reputation, so they have no choice but not to send reinforcements.

My father named several knightly families in the southern part of the Quardenze territory who would be in charge of reinforcements, and told them who the general of the reinforcements would be.

I think the most pressing issue is with the main ancestral army advancing in the west, but can we leave that side alone? As I was thinking this, my father made a supplementary comment.

"Meryl told me that there are reinforcements on the west side. I don't know where they are, but we can count on them now that we need as many troops as possible. Considering that Spierzeik is active in the dark, if we are not careful, the mainland army may appear in Haritos as well. Our priority is to strike there first."

I pictured the map in my mind, wondering where the reinforcements would come from, but the Silopeia family was the only one I could think of in terms of location.

Perhaps the knights were also wondering where these reinforcements were coming from, but they were in no mood to ask such a question carefree now.

Well, since my mother, who is from the Evenapis family, said it would be all right, it would be better to trust her. Every fiefdom has a secret or two.

"The Galiana family's disturbance will be put on hold for the time being. Keep a close watch on Galiana Milord to make sure she doesn't get herself into any more trouble."

If this happens, Viscount Galiana, who has taken refuge in the Quardenze territory, is like a bomb.

If he were to receive sweet words from the Spierzeik family and sympathize with them, an enemy would suddenly appear in the interior, and this would be a major crisis for the Quardenze family.

My father presented a general policy for the defense of the city of Nambonan, and the knights hurriedly worked out the details.

As I watched this scene, I felt a sense of irritation that bordered on indignation.

I wondered how long it would take to get to the city of Nambonan with the army up and ready to go.

Even as we were doing this, the city of Nambonan might be under attack by Spierzeik's army.

According to the message, the number of soldiers in Spierzeik's army was estimated to be less than 40,000, while the number of soldiers in Quardenze's army, which was originally stationed in Nambonan City, was estimated to be 60,400. The number is said to be 0. There will not be much time, but the number of soldiers will increase even more if they are drafted from the surrounding villages and towns.

I think it is better to rush in and fight with the local soldiers while the number of soldiers is still higher.

As a lover of love and double peace, I would prefer to avoid fighting against the nobility, but there is no way I would feel nothing if my city were to fall.

"Father."

And my father has not shown what is most important, what is holding him back. It is the nomination of a general for the defense of Nambonan City.

Right now, I am the only one who can take on the Lord's Army that is attacking Nambonan City.

Even an army with a large number of knights might be able to drive them back. However, if we were to go head-on against the main ancestral army, we might lose a lot of knights. Considering the future management of the territory, that is something we should not do.

Under the current circumstances, where we cannot read how deep-rooted the Spierzeik family's schemes are, it would be a bad move for my father to leave the city of New Nellie.

My father must order me to be the general-in-chief of the defense of Nambonan City and reinforcements for my grandfather.

"...... what?"

It was such a reply, as if he didn't like my call.

Oh, by the way, Viscount Galiana said. My father is very overprotective of me.

In the Battle of Nambonan, the only enemies were commoners. But this time, my opponent was Spierzeik Verret, the heir apparent and next head of the Spierzeik family. It would be a battle between the main ancestor and the main ancestor.

My father must have already decided in his mind that I would be the general.

I knew better than anyone that he was not a foolish head of the Quardenze family who would invite a crisis to the Quardenze family out of love for his own child.

If I waited, my father would appoint me general-in-chief by the end of the war council, but right now I feel that even the time to wait for that is too short.

I think I am just one step short of being ready.

Then all I have to do is to encourage him to take that step.

I put my hand on the Water Snake's treasure sword at my waist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 166 - Quardenze's Serpent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Like a leaf that shakes in a great river, so it sinks to the bottom of the water."

"Like the serpent that runs up the great river, so shall it rise up to the mountain."

"All things are as man knows them."

"I am the serpent of Quardenze."

"Farewell, old robe."

"There is only one road to conquer."

After finishing his speech, he swung down his treasured sword, which he had raised high. The sound of the blade cutting through the air echoed well in the quiet room.

I silently stare at my father with my arm outstretched, and he looks at me as well.

My skin was numb from the tense air, and I felt as if I might slip on the treasure sword in my sweat.

This is a passage from the beginning of the play "The Red Devil and the Five Princesses," the departure of Quardenze Cassia.

The power of the kingdom of Voistra, which was at its peak at the time, was great, and the Quardenze family was always outnumbered.

Princess Cassia, who had been intelligent and bold from her childhood, jumped into the swell of the times in order to break through the status quo.

This passage is set on a small hill on the outskirts of the city of Newbery.

The flow of the Orvieto River, the great river that flows east of the Quardenze territory, was often beautifully serpentine, and it resembled a giant snake.

On that day, Princess Kasia climbed a small hill in the suburbs of New Nerrie and looked at the majestic flow of the river, determining the path she should take and expressing her feelings.

I wonder if my father understood what I was trying to say.

Like Princess Cassia, who once stood up to the threat of the kingdom of Voistra, I must make a decision to face the threat of the Spierzeik family that now looms.

My father, the son of Quardenze Kasia, the founder of the Quardenze family, should be able to do so.

"Wilk."

My father calls my name.

"It was a good speech."

Smiling lightly, as if self-mocking, my father slowly closed his eyes.

'I see Mother has scolded you, what you're doing. ......

Whatever was floating behind his eyelids, the little words were filled with a feeling akin to nostalgia.

But when my father opened his eyelids again, there were the same silver eyes filled with the dignity of an aristocrat as always.

"The general of the defense of the city of Nambonan is Quardenze Wilk. Crush the fools of Spierzeik."

I exhaled as I looked up at the clear, cloudless winter morning sky. The cold air colored the sky white, and in the blink of an eye, it flowed backward.

The horse's body heat, enhanced by magic, was blazing hot, and my crotch and buttocks were sweating.

"Aah!"

I sat up and sat back in the saddle to release the heat that had built up in my lower body. The horse was kicking wildly at the ground, paying no attention to my movements.

I guessed from the scenery flowing by my side that the horse was running as fast as a car on the highway.

Even if he fell off the horse, he would not die if it was the body of the main ancestor, but he was still a little scared.

However, now that he had succeeded in persuading his father to entrust him with the generalship, he could not afford to falter.

"Wilk-sama!"

I turn my head only to hear a voice behind me. There was a small group of elite warriors consisting of about 50 people.

All of them were mounted on horses strengthened by my magic, and they were following me closely in formation.

"At least the engineering soldiers are ......!"

One of the knights breaks away from the line and stands beside me, advising me.

I don't need to ask you all to understand that this is a proposal that has been made many times before to replenish the ranks.

"No need!　We'll keep the same speed!"

I had had enough of listening to him, and I showed the knight that I was not going to listen to his advice with strong words and attitude.

After the play was over at New Nellie Castle, my father entrusted me with the knight Gatoren as my second-in-command and several active knights as my assistants.

At this time, the knights were planning to lead the troops stationed in New Nellie City to reinforce Nambonan City.

However, there was no time to waste in gathering soldiers, and the march would be delayed if they were to take along the slow-footed commoner soldiers.

Therefore, I insisted on a forced march by a very small elite force consisting only of myself and the knights.

Since there were Quardenze soldiers in Nambonan, there was no need to take them all the way from New Nellie City.

Thanks to the theatrical effect, my idea was basically accepted, although there was some push and shove.

As expected, my father was concerned about the fact that there were no commoner soldiers to serve as a wall, so he added more squires other than knights to the army.

　

The knight's family comes to greet the New Year with a large group, and many of them are candidates for the next knighthood or are excellent military officers.

My father picked up such young and lively people. In terms of combat ability, they were the best.

In this way, the Wilk Corps, a reinforcement force for the city of Nambonan, was completed with about 50 men, consisting of several knights and young members of knight families, and they were finally able to leave the castle of New Nellie.

Looking at me from the side, the knight seemed to be looking for his next words while making a difficult face in response to my reply.

I don't think I'm going to gather troops in New Nellie City or any of the other cities along the way," he said.

The primary goal of any operation nowadays is rapid reinforcements!　Do not misjudge me!"

I turned my face forward and concentrated on driving my horse.

Certainly, with more than one knight, even a few thousand men would be able to move quickly.

But that is a speed of march that is only within the bounds of common sense for nobles and knights. In other words, it is a speed of march that is predictable even for the Spierzeik family.

In order to break down Spierzeig's evil plan, I feel that a feat like smashing the enemy's timetable would be necessary.

The cities of New Nellie and Nambonan are far apart, but with the mobility of this Wilk force, they could at least reach them before nightfall.

It would be a far cry from gathering troops in the cities and then setting out.

We will leave it to you to lead the way," he said. We will not slow down.

As we approach a slightly wider street, the knight Gatoren lines up beside me.

He is a knight with a calm atmosphere, about the age of a retired businessman.

He must have sensed that I had already made up my mind and gave up trying to persuade me.

"Okay, please."

I was a little relieved to see Knight Gatoren's reaction.

Since a knight's loyalty is to the head of the Quardenze family, he will always admonish his trueborn son if he tries to do something wrong, and in some cases, he may even refuse to follow orders.

Paradoxically, the fact that he didn't strongly oppose me means that my plan to attack the city of Nambonan is not that crazy.

"Ha. Leave it to me."

Since it was more reliable to have someone familiar with the territory's roads lead the way, I quickly took the lead.

Immediately, the knight Gatoren and several of the young military officers leaped forward.

Gatoren, the leading knight, signaled by moving his arms and hands from side to side, and a formation resembling the diamond symbol on a playing card was formed around me.

As one would expect, everyone is used to being on horseback.

The horse that received my body enhancement magic was very difficult to ride, if I do say so myself. They dance and bounce on the ground, and are swung up and down and from side to side.

However, not only the knights but also all the young military officers rode without a hitch, and they did not break ranks. In fact, I was the one who was the most unsteady.

I guess young people who come to the New Year's greetings are well educated.

It would not look good if the person who is telling them to hurry is the slowest.

I put strength into my grip on the reins.

In order to get from New Nellie City to Nambonan City, we needed to cross the Great River to the west.

After discussing this with the knights, we decided to cross the river at a point upstream from the city of Nambonan.

Although this route would increase the distance to be traveled, I was not familiar with large rivers or boats, so I decided to accept their advice.

There were two main reasons for the decision to cross the river upstream.

The first was the expected deployment of the enemy's main ancestral army.

Basically, nobles tend to be cautious at best and timid at worst. Well, it could also be that the knights under their command were worried.

Considering this, it is highly likely that the enemy's main ancestral army is deployed to the west or southwest of the city of Nambonan. It is a position from which they could easily retreat to Spierzeik territory in the event of an emergency.

If the Wilk forces cross the river upstream to Nambonan City, they will emerge from the northeast direction of the city, which will allow them to keep their distance from the enemy's main ancestral army.

A small number of fast-moving Wilk forces would also be able to easily join up with their friends in Nambonan City before they are captured by the enemy.

Second is the difficulty of crossing the river.

It is difficult to imagine, but if Spierzeik's army had control of the river, rather than control of the sea around Nambonan City, they could sink the ship if they were too careless in crossing the river.

Even if they were not, if they were discovered while crossing the river, the enemy's main army would attack from the shore. If the enemy's magic has a long range of fire, it could sink the boat if it is unlucky.

It is difficult to imagine a situation where the upper reaches of the river are under control, so the idea is to sneak across the river from there.

Furthermore, the Amelia River, a large river that flows west of the territory of Kuordenze, has a large volume of water and a steep current, so it would be safer and quicker to cross the river with a skilled helmsman.

In this respect, it is convenient because there are still military river ports upstream, which were mainly used before the conquest of the city of Nambonan.

I can swim 25 meters in a crawl or breaststroke. With the strength of my ancestors, I should be able to manage my physical fitness.

The Quardenze family has a legitimate son, Quardenze Wilk!　I heard of the crisis in the city of Nambonan and swam over!" It should not be impossible to land on the other side of the river, say .......

When I jokingly made this suggestion, it was immediately rejected as not feasible. Not only was it too reckless, but, to my surprise, knights and military officers could not swim.

Perhaps it was the pride of the ruling class, but they had never played in the river like the commoners. Indeed, I too have never swum since I was born on the continent of Eluo.

Even nobles and knights who seem to have strong strength may be killed more easily than expected if you push them into a river.

In the end, we were able to cross the Amelia River as planned without much trouble.

Since the crossing was done in two parts, those who started first were already ready to go.

I stuffed my stomach with the lunch I couldn't finish on the boat and got ready to leave. I was on the last boat.

"We will now proceed to the open sea. ......"

Knight Gatoren opens his mouth.

The level of danger is different from that in the interior. Be very careful.

Because of the new territories that have been added in the last 20 years or so, the rule of the Quardenze family has not yet penetrated so deeply in the outer regions.

There are reports that the remnants of the ruined knight families have turned into guerrillas and are cooperating with the Spierzeik forces.

They are really troublesome people who cannot live because they have lost their head nobleman and just keep on struggling to find a place to die.

There was a saying on Earth that it is more difficult to end a war than to start one, and I have no doubt that it will hold true on the continent of Eruo.

I nodded to Knight Gatoren's words and vowed to watch out for enemy raids.

We mounted the horses we had brought from the interior by boat and started riding in a southwesterly direction.

I could see that the knights and military officers were more alert than in the interior, and the ranks surrounding me were more tense than ever.

According to the knights, it is expected that there are some scouts of Spierzeig's army lurking in this area.

The Spierzeiks are naturally wary of the reinforcements that are expected to come from the city of Newbery, and they have sent scouts to the upper reaches of the river where they are likely to land.

However, since no scouts can move faster than the Wilkes, there is no need to fear too much when they are discovered. There are no telephones or radios on the Eruo continent, so by the time the scouts return to report to Spierzeig's army, Wilk's force will have long since arrived.

The knight and the military officer decided that it would be better to hurry to the city of Nambonan, not to worry about being found.

The Wilks proceeded along the main road.

They had just left New Nellie City this morning, but they would reach Nambonan City in the evening,.......

"Is that the enemy?"

Pointing in the direction of travel, I paid a visit to the knight running next to me.

Ever since we had started running through the open country, I had been casting a detection spell in a forward direction.

In the forest off the road, in the center of a small group of dark sesame seeds visible from a distance, I could sense the presence of a squire-level magician.

"There's one follower soldier here."

"Ha. I will confirm."

The knight then puts his fingers to his temples and stares ahead as if glaring.

The knight, who must have enhanced his eyesight with magic, immediately identified the group of sesame grains as an enemy army and alerted everyone to be on the alert.

"The enemy has no more than 20 men, so it should be easy to kick them out when they come at us," he said. ......Those flags, they are a bunch of deadbeats. They are utterly abominable."

Apparently, the banner of a knightly family that served a noble family that had already been destroyed is hidden among the group.

"What, even the knights have survived?"

"No, the knights of that house were defeated in a great battle. Perhaps it was the remaining family members and their minions. I thought they were here to martyr themselves for their late lord."

The knight says that the vengeance against the Quardenze family is probably being used by the Spiaseik family.

Even if the Spierzeiks win, there is no future for the knightly family that has lost its head.

In the meantime, the distance between the two houses is shrinking.

The group of enemies, which looked like sesame grains, became so large that they could be identified as human beings.

"Enemies, get ready to intercept!"

"How may I help you?"

The small army, visible from a distance, appears to have left the forest, deployed to the street, and is beginning to form up.

Because of the speed of the Wilk forces, it would be possible to bypass them and avoid the battle.

"Of course, we have no intention of doing that; we are in a hurry. Besides, ......."

"Hmmm... ......."

I can't help but smile.

The presence of enemy troops was indeed a welcome presence. We could practice before colliding with the main body of the enemy.

"Keep going straight. We'll trample them down."

As I said this, I picked up a spear to use on horseback. It resembles a huge brush if you only look at its silhouette.

If I were to compare it to a dragon scimitar, it would be closer to a scimitar. The handle is a dark rouge color, and the blade is shaped like a candle flame flickering in a light breeze.

One wonders if this is a spear, but on the continent of Eruo it is recognized as a type of spear. Any weapon with a long handle is a spear.

Since swords cannot reach on horseback, everyone carries a spear like this.

"Listen!　I will strengthen them all!　Don't let change shake you off!"

I stand up on my horse, raise my spear to the heavens and call out.

The more powerful the body-enhancing magic is, the more the changes confuse our perception and awareness, and we can lose our balance and fall. This is even more so when it comes to enhancement using my vast magical power.

The people who are following me now are the best warriors in the Quardenze territory. I want to believe that they can withstand my strengthening magic.

"Leave it to me!"

"I'll follow you with everything I've got!"

"Young Master, feel free to do so!"

Whether my thoughts were conveyed or whether they were just genuinely proud to be able to receive the body-enhancing magic of a nobleman, the young military officer in particular responded with a voice full of joy.

Perhaps it was the excitement of the battlefield, but my own heartbeat was louder than the sound of my horse's footsteps as it ran like a rampaging horse and rumbled on the ground.

"Only the follower soldiers should be targeted!　Kick them to the curb!"

I raise my voice at such a distance that the two armies are about to collide.

In order to meet their expectations, I squeeze out the magical power that is buzzing inside my body and activate the body enhancement magic.

I said, "Uu......."

Instantly, a voice filled with suffering echoes from the knight next to him.

'Ooooh ......'

It spread like ripples on the surface of the water to the troops.

"Ooooh ......!"

But that agony is only a prelude to the rapture that follows.

"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

As if to expel the enormous energy they had been given from their mouths, the warriors let out a yell.

Their wild voices, which seemed to come up from the depths of the earth, resembled the sound of an engine waiting for a gear change after the rpms had reached their full capacity.

The volume of breath exhaled from the military officers was no less than that of the exhaust from heavy machinery. The heat level of the troops had clearly increased.

"Forward!　Cut through!"

"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"

The roar of the Wilk squad frightened some of the enemy soldiers into turning away, but one of the military officers, determined not to let them escape, swung his spear at an angle.

I happened to be able to see the scene through the gap between the two officers.

The frightened expressions on the enemy soldiers' faces were distorted by the spear's tip, and their skulls were shattered, sending red splashes of blood as if in slow motion.

Another young warrior swung his spear, similar to a naginata, in a horizontal line.

Without warning, a black shadow burst into flames, showering the fleeing soldiers to the side with a shower of fresh blood.

At the same time as I hear the screams of the enemy soldiers, the reaction of the enemy follower soldiers disappears from my magic detection.

The object that blew up was an enemy follower.

I only realized this after I had broken through the enemy forces and was running through.

It happened in less than 30 seconds ...... or even 10 seconds after making contact with the enemy troops.

"Ha, ha, ha ......"

Looking back, only there was a path as if it had been trampled by the Titans, and the ground was stained red by blood and guts.

The lives that had been there just a few seconds before could no longer even be counted.

It was a scene that symbolized violence by an overwhelmingly strong man.

"Wow! ......!"

"Ha ha!"　You were like rags!"

The young military officers who had run through the front of the group look back and confirm the intense results of the battle.

Their eyes blazing and bloodshot as if intoxicated by body-enhancing magic, their white teeth peeked out.

Their faces were splattered with blood, as if they were bloodthirsty murderers.

Seeing them, I cool down a bit. This is not even an outpost, it's too early to get carried away.

I cleared my throat and then raised my voice.

"It's time to get down to business!　Everybody brace yourselves!"

The young military officers in front of us looked flabbergasted and turned their faces back in the direction they were going.

At the same time, the knight Gatoren brought his horse closer to me.

"What's the matter?"

"I wonder if you could stop once around here and un-strengthen us. We would like to get used to the drop-off while we still can."

Checking his surroundings, the knight Gatoren said, his expression hardening a bit.

I accept it and give the order to halt the march.

Magic, not just body enhancement magic, is basically a form of magic that must be activated continuously.

This is different from the game's auxiliary magic, which, once applied, remains in effect for a certain number of turns.

In other words, I am in the process of applying body enhancement magic to all the soldiers and horses in the Wilk team.

The physical enhancement magic is not only effective immediately after it is applied, but what is even more painful is when it is terminated.

If they are used to it, it is difficult for them to become sluggish, but unfortunately, this was the first time they had been subjected to my body enhancement magic.

The stronger the enhancement, the greater the impact when it is released. It was probably because they were wary of the fallout that knight Gatoren took the trouble to advise them to terminate after stopping.

"I am sorry, sir, but I must ask you to allow me to dismount."

"Mm?　All right."

The young people mouthed that they were fine with staying on horseback, but the knight-gatherer silenced them and forced them all to dismount.

When they were all in the posture of correcting their posture and bowing, I cast off my body-enhancing magic.

"......!

"Oooh......!"

"Gooooo!"

Immediately, cries of anguish rose up from the surroundings.

The young military officer, who had been looking relaxed until a moment ago, turned so pale that he looked as if he might collapse at any moment and shut his mouth. Some of them were on one knee on the ground, trying desperately to stifle their vomiting.

The knights were not in obvious pain, and they were looking clear, but their clenched fists were trembling.

I wondered if I had overdone it, and just as I was thinking that, the knights came slowly closer to me.

"It's wonderful, it's reinforced, young master!　You don't have to worry about it. ......!"

"That's right. We are the Spears of Quardenze ......!　Please swing it to your heart's content. ......!

His words showed his concern for me, of course, but rather well other feelings. It was an emotion of joy.

Perhaps being freed from the reinforcement allowed him to better perceive the mighty power that had been given to him.

They had the heart of a boy comic book hero, if you will....... who simply yearned for strength.

Not to be outdone by the knights, the young military officers also stood up.

After all, they were the elite, and it didn't take them long to get back on their horses and start riding again.

The shadows darkened and the winter air made my heart feel lonely.

The city of Nambonan, caught in my vision, was colored by the setting sun and seemed to be bleeding.

The Quardenze forces continued to attack and defend against Spierzeik's army, and I could see people dying on the ground.

The distance between Wilk's army and the city of Nambonan is about the same as one stop on a train in the countryside in prehistoric Japan.

We were watching the Spierzeik forces as we hid in the trees on the hillside to the northeast of the city.

"We made it in time."

The city walls, visible from a distance, were crumbling in places, but had not yet fallen.　

What is now unfolding is not a siege but a battle in the field.

The city walls were in the process of being rebuilt, and their defensive strength was close to zero. The local commanders, judging that a siege would be difficult, probably decided to attack from the city.

The Quardenze forces were deployed to surround the city, and the Spierzeig forces were deployed to envelop it.

If you look closely, you can see several areas where the ground has been gouged out, as if it had been bombed. It was apparent that the mainland army must have been on the front line several times.

Spierzeig Werret seemed to be taking a rest now, or perhaps he was moving backwards. As initially expected, the main ancestral army is encamped on a hill located in the southwest direction from the city.

"The battle situation doesn't look too bad."

"The movement of the militia is good."

"Morale seems high."

Each of the young military officers was analyzing the war situation.

Several of them were discussing with each other, reading the number of troops from the formations and maneuvers, and deciphering the superiority or inferiority of the situation.

It seemed that they were discussing among themselves, but they had all come to the conclusion that the Quardenze forces were not inferior at the moment.

The squires of the knight family have a lot of experience in war. I can't make such a confident analysis of what on earth they are looking at to determine superiority or inferiority.

"Which of them are the citizen soldiers?"

I ask the young military officer closest to me.

It was difficult to distinguish between ordinary Quardenze soldiers and Nambonan citizen soldiers.

The Nambonan militiamen drafted from the city were likely to have been given their equipment by the Quardenze army, so they could not be judged by their weapons and armor.

Knights and military officers are said to be able to tell somewhat by looking at their movements.

'Yes, ...... can you recognize the military flag of that Gatoren family?'

Since the knight Gatoren is very close to me, that military flag fluttering on the battlefield is expected to be that of a Gatoren family member.

"Ah. It's the front line troops right now, isn't it?　There's a lot of momentum."

"Yes, sir. Most of those troops are Nambonan citizen soldiers."

"...... That's great."

Even though they are led by a Gatoren family member, it is somewhat unexpected that conscripted citizen soldiers are fighting on the front lines and with such an advantage that I can see.

If you listen carefully, you can hear the shouts of "Long live the city of Nambonan" reaching us from afar on the wind. It seems that they are trying to raise the morale of the people of Nambonan by kindling their love for their hometown.

The Nambonan soldiers do not seem to be bothered by the waves of killing intent that are being sent out from the main ancestral army in the rear of the city. They are not bothered by this, which is something you can only do if you have a strong will.

"If we join forces now, we can push them back all at once. This too will be possible only with your immediate decision, young master."

"I see."

The military officer kept his gaze fixed in the distance as if he were waiting for the time to join up, while only his hands were carefully adjusting his weapons.

With the city of Nambonan in sight, Wilk's group was making preparations before colliding with the main body of the enemy.

Charging in with full force is the source of unexpected accidents, the knight said. Sounds like a slogan from a construction site.

I had some thoughts about the words of the military officer, so I quietly left the place.

"Knight Gatoren."

I had business with Gatoren, the knight attached to me as second in command.

"Ha."

So I look around to make sure I'm not attracting attention from the others.

A few were looking at me, but when they saw how I was avoiding their attention, they turned their bodies in the direction of the day after tomorrow.

"I want to ask you something. How do you intend to act after this?"

When I told him that I wanted to confirm the strategy, Knight Gatoren immediately began to answer.

"The enemy's main ancestral army is pulling back, and we cannot let this opportunity pass us by. We will join up with our friends before the enemy captures us."

"......"

"It is to be expected that some of the enemy forces will read our aim and come to obstruct us, but so will the friendly forces, and they will do their best to make way to join us. Fortunately, there seem to be some smart military officers stationed in the northern part of the city. They will be ready to move as soon as we send them a signal. And ......"

Knight Gatoren spun his words fluidly, as if he had been thinking about the situation while on the move so that he would be prepared to deal with any situation.

"After joining ......, we will immediately disband this unit and evenly distribute the personnel to the friendly units. The reinforcement of each unit's retinue will make it easier for us to gain an advantage throughout the battle area,......."

I've already heard the part I want to confirm, but the story doesn't end.

"...... young master is arriving, and the morale of the friendly forces is expected to be greatly boosted. I will join the main force of the Nambonan garrison and rapidly deploy a force with Wilk-sama as its general-in-chief to put pressure on the enemy's main ancestral army. ......"

The plan was to drive back the Spierzeig forces and to ensure my personal safety first and foremost.

If I had said nothing, the knight Gatoren would have chosen this strategy without hesitation. But I had a plan.

"I had a plan."

"What would it be like?"

"The idea is that we don't join up with them right away."

Knight Gatoren looked reluctant, but did not immediately deny it. I guess he would ask me everything and then try to make a decision.

My roots are still rooted in the values of my earthly days, when I had nothing to do with battles. That is why I wanted the judgment of a war professional on the continent of Eruo.

I have confidence that it will work, but there is a possibility that it will be taken as the opinion of an idiot who knows too little about war.

It would be shameful to suddenly announce my idea in front of everyone and have it rejected, so I wanted them to listen to what I had to say behind the scenes. If I was going to show my shame, the fewer people in the room, the better.

When I told him my plan, the knight Gatoren showed his reluctance.

"It's ......"

"But if done well, it would greatly reduce the power of the Spierzeig family, wouldn't it?"

My idea is very simple.

We would cast body-enhancement magic on the Wilk squad and charge in, destroying enemy units individually with divine speed, killing and wounding Spierzeik's knights and squires as we went.

"But ......"

If it had been Knight Gatoren immediately after his departure from the city of Newbery this morning, he would have immediately rejected such an operation.

But Knight Gatoren has seen firsthand the power of my body enhancement magic.

After crossing the river, Wilk's team eventually broke through three scouting units. Although all of them were led by squires, they broke through them as if they were ripping open a piece of shoji paper.

There was enough of a track record to convince them of the possibility of success in the street operation.

"As soon as we confirm the approach of the main ancestral army, we will join up with our friends. This will not be a problem. After this, we will have reinforcements for Grandfather, so don't you think we should avenge any enemies we can?"

"............ that's true, but ......"

If the Wilk forces joined their friends, the Spierzeig forces might retreat immediately.

This is because the enemy's strategy is to drop the city of Nambonan, where there is no main ancestor, and the premise collapses in the first place. It would be safer to retreat with no damage than to fight badly.

However, considering that after defending Nambonan City, they would go to support their grandfather who was fighting at the frontline base, they would have to inflict some damage on Spierzeig's forces or there would still be a part of them that was uneasy.

There is a possibility that they will attack Nambonan City again at the same time I head for the frontline base, or even attack me in a pincer attack.

Taking out the knights and military officers who commanded the troops here would lead to a narrowing of the options available to the Spierzeig forces.

With the main army in the rear, the only dangerous presence would be the retinue, including the knights. This can only be called bonus time.

The knight Gatoren must understand the situation.

"As you know, I just experienced my first battle. I don't have much experience in fighting."

Ultimately, I believe that is the majority of the reason for Knight Gatoren's hesitation.

He must be thinking about whether I would get carried away with the knight hunt and misjudge my retreat, or whether I would be reckless and go charging into the enemy's main army.

"That is why I leave it to the knights to decide when to join up with their friends. Is that clear?"

"Does that mean that all the knights must be in agreement?"

"No, it is not. If even one of us decides that we should do so, we will join up with our friends immediately."

I decided to leave the decision to pull out to the knights.

Apparently, this decision was a very big one for knight Gatoren, his reluctant face softened a bit.

In the first place, I had never thought of deciding when to join up with my friends by myself. I had no confidence that I would be able to make a calm decision when I entered the battlefield, even though I could not read the battle situation from a distance.

Perhaps the knight Gatoren had taken it as a strategy that I would decide the timing? If so, I can understand why he would feel uneasy.

After a polite bow, the knight gatherer agreed to the street operation.

The details of the operation were immediately determined and awareness was shared.

Basically, he will explain the operation to other knights and military officers. All I had to do was tell everyone to do their best.

I looked around and saw that almost everyone had finished checking their equipment and were ready to march at any time.

"Attention, everyone!"

The knight Gatoren calls out to them. In this case, there is no mistake that he means "Pay attention to the young master.

The military officers looked at me with a serious expression on their faces.

"I will now explain the plan. Listen carefully."

"Ha!"

I listened to the knight Gatoren's explanation in silence, wondering what comment to make, but keeping my face serious.

"We will now assault the enemy forces attacking the city of Nambonan and destroy the knights of Spierzeig."

"Oh," a small voice shouted.

The young military officers were jubilant, while the knights were anxious.

Knight Gatoren explained what he and I had talked about earlier and said he would join up with his friends if the enemy's main army moved.

He said, "We will crush the enemy who avenge ...... Quardenze."

Knight Gatoren said this last in a low, slightly wrinkled voice.

The words seemed to be filled with an emotion bordering on indignation. After all, he probably wanted to fight Spierzeig's army, too.

"Young Master."

Knight Gatoren turned around and stepped back, lowering himself slightly.

He pretended to be asking us to inspire everyone. What was he going to do if ...... I didn't think anything of it?

I stepped forward as if to say, I'm going to talk to you now.

"What is winning this battle?"

I spoke as if I were talking to someone without being question-like, so that no one would respond.

I asked him, "Do you mean to join up with your friends and push back Spierzeig's army?"

The knight, who still looks anxious, probably wants to do so.

But it is a draw.

In fact, it would be a terrible blow to the old Voistra if a series of counteroffensive operations failed.

The city of Nambonan would not be able to take any of the city's wealth, and would only be left with a tidy profit from the cost of business trips.

From an economic standpoint, the Kuordenze family may have won the battle by pushing back.

But the Spierzeiks have proven to the outside world that they are not going to let the Quardenze get the better of them.

It demonstrated the influence of the Spiaseik family, which was large enough to incorporate the rebellion of the aristocratic families of the Free Cities County and the Galiana family into its operations.

If he had merely pushed back, he would have been able to say, "After all, the Spiaseik are the former Voistra royal family, and the Spiaseik have a great deal of power. It seems that the Quardenze family had its hands full just pushing back the Spiaseik.

Considering the fact that many aristocrats overestimate their valor, this could trigger anti-Quardenze movements in various parts of the country.

From a diplomatic standpoint, that would be a defeat.

That is why it is a street operation.

The Spierzeik family's strategy was defeated by the Quardenze family, resulting in the death of several knights who supported the territory. Moreover, they fled back home without being able to drop even one of their cities. How foolish and pathetic. I definitely want the reputation of .......

"Pushing back is not enough to win. Isn't that right?"

Grateful that everyone is listening to my words in silence, I move on to the next line in my brain-campaign.

"I, and you, should know. That we have the power here and now to lay waste to them. ......!"

I raise one arm and release my magic. The release of magic power without intention is not harmful, just a feeling of pressure.

For knights and military officers, however, the pressure is a reminder of the exhilaration of body-enhancing magic.

The moment I saw the excitement in the eyes of the knight, who was looking at me anxiously, I decided that this was the moment to win.

I pulled out of its sheath the treasured sword of the water snake that I had brought with me from New Nellie Castle, which was at my waist.

As I pointed the shining silver sword at Nambonan City, I opened my mouth wide.

"Look at that!"

In the city of Nambonan, several units are moving and fighting.

Each unit of the Spierzeik Army is led by a knight or a squire military officer, so they are more agile and their attacks are more intense than those of ordinary units, but after all, it is only physical enhancement magic at the level of a squire.

Compared to the mobility and offensive power of the Wilk forces, there is a difference.

"Is that a pack of thick-haired rabbits?　The defense looks solid, but the movement is really slow!"

Thick-haired rabbits with voluminous body hair are so powerful that they cannot even accept the fangs of wild dogs.

However, they are so slow-moving that they are unable to escape from foreign enemies.

Praying that knights and military officers know the ecology of the thick-haired rabbit, I continue.

"The bristles of the thick-haired rabbit can repel the fangs of a wolf, but there is only one thing that can take its life!　It's the fangs of the snake!"

The fangs of some snakes are so sharp and long that they can slip through the thick haired rabbit's body hair and reach the flesh.

Rumon once told me that thick-haired rabbits are often killed by poisonous snakes.

"I am the serpent of Quardenze!　There is no need to fear the rabbit!"

The young military officers stand hot.

I think I'm getting a little excited about my line myself.

"Let's go!　We will destroy Spierzeig!"

I jumped on my horse and posed as Napoleon crossing the Alps.

Personally, I think this is the coolest pose for a man on horseback, so I wanted to try it.

Apparently, this looked cool to the people of the Eruo continent as well, and the military officers mounted their horses with cheers and looked at me with expectant eyes.

I smiled and made a high-spirited declaration.

"Our goal, Nambonan City!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 167 - Pulverization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Horses run through.

It tramples flesh, tears guts, and stains the earth with flowing blood, but it never slackens in its steps.

The white color of the human bones, intricately broken and protruding from the body, was painfully dazzling to eyes accustomed to the setting sun and fresh blood.

"Kill him!"

The roar of the advancing military officer in front of him drives the enemy soldiers away and opens a path leading to the target.

The Wilks Corps indiscriminately took the lives of all those in their path equally, whether they had failed to escape or were resisting.

"Knight Deonna! Prepare yourself!"

The military officer who was running in the lead seemed to have made contact with an enemy knight, and a shadow could be seen swinging a large spear.

"Oooooh!"

A sound that I can no longer describe as just a strong vibration, mixed with the various emotions around me, assaulted my ears.

A round shadow blows across the evening sky like blood dripping on a black veil. Is that the head of the knight Deonna?

"Strike them down! Come on, break away! Kill the men and proceed!"

When the young military officer announced the completion of the killing, the Spierzeig soldiers around the knight Deonna tried to flee in all directions as if they were spiders.

But it is the center of a dense enemy force, and enemy soldiers with long spears clash with each other, making it difficult for them to move.

"Get out of the way!"

The warrior swung his spear as if he wanted it to disperse quickly, and the upper and lower halves of his body separated as if he were cutting a radish with a knife.

Against a power gap that could never be reversed, the commoner soldiers simply crawled to the ground and begged forgiveness from no one. Even if it was the ground overflowing with the blood of their comrades.

"Knight Gatoren, are you still up for it?"

This time, my only role was to apply physical enhancement magic to the military officers. But even so, the strain of repeatedly assaulting enemy units was not small, and my breathing was a little erratic.

And it's a little sickening to see flesh and blood splattered in front of your eyes. It was a far cry from simply burning enemy soldiers with magic from afar.

"Ha. The enemy is more confused than we expected. The same is true of our ancestors' army. I think we can defeat a few more units."

"Good."

The street operation was in the midst of success.

The Spierzeig forces were helpless in the face of the blitzkrieg attack and had already lost commanders in six units. The Wilk Corps was able to destroy each unit with its high-speed maneuvers.

"Move it! That unit is next!"

I point out the troops located in the direction where the knight Gatoren points, and I shout out.

The horses, excited by the blood, paid no mind to the commoners crawling on the ground, and showed their full strength.

Some were bounced off the ground as if by an express train, while others were trampled over and over again by the four legs and turned into mincemeat. There were various forms of death.

The key to the street operation is to overcome the miscellaneous soldiers and take out the commander with the power of a divine breakthrough. There is no time to rest.

After running through the enemy troops, Wilk's unit immediately struck for its next target.

The follower soldiers here are three! Cut down surely, not hastily!"

This unit was led by a knight as commander, and the enemy commoner soldiers also received a small amount of body enhancement magic.

But that's not a big deal.

In addition to the fact that the physical strengthening magic at the level of a follower is not much, there are several hundred soldiers in the assault area alone, so the strengthening of each individual is naturally weakened. It is like a drink that has been diluted with too much water.

It is a world of difference from the Wilk Corps, which is composed of a small number of military officers who have received a level of reinforcement that surpasses that of the main ancestor.

As if to prove the point, first the head of the first squire is chopped off, and then, without a moment's delay, the torso of the second, a knight, is chopped off.

"Woah!!!!"

"Oh, I ain't from Spierzeig! Help me!"

The third follower, apparently from a commoner background, was about to turn his back on us and flee.

"You coward!"

Perhaps annoyed by his flighty attitude, the military officer raised two spears with an angry shout. The spears, held in both hands, resembled naginata swords.

A flash of fire from the crossed arms drew a cross on the back and turned the follower into four lumps of flesh.

"Hiiiiiiiii!"

"The knight! The knight, the knight, he's been killed!

"Help me!"

With the knight killed, the reinforcing magic that had been applied to the enemy soldiers in this unit dissipates into the clouds.

The resistance that had been felt during the raid was completely gone, and the breakaway was able to move on as if it were going through an uninhabited field.

The number of units crushed is now seven, the number of knights killed is four, and the number of retinue soldiers and military officers is eleven. At this point, it was already a spectacular battle.

If you look to the left, you can see the knight Gatoren giving orders to the commanders of the Quardenze army.

A wooden stick with a cloth wrapped around the tip is struck against a gong to make a sound, and the sound conveys a rough intention by its condition. 

The stick resembles a kiritanpo, and the gong resembles a wok, both of which are commonly used sound instruments on the Eruo continent.

Goin, goin, goin

As the sound echoes, the various units of the Quardenze army change their direction and attack the enemy troops. They blocked the enemy's rendezvous and supported the assault of the Wilk forces.

Not wanting to let the help of my friends go to waste, I took aim at an isolated enemy unit and gave the following instructions.

"Don't stop! Keep moving! That's next!"

The military officers, who are also eager to take advantage of this opportunity, begin to run in the direction I have indicated.

I follow behind them, careful not to be swept away by the horse's acceleration.

I suddenly looked at the situation of the main ancestral army, but they were still in the rear.

There must be many excellent knights and military officers in the Spierzeig family, I don't understand why they are so slow to respond.

I looked at the military officer riding right next to me, as I could see that the knight Gatoren had his hands full controlling the horses and beating gongs.

I wanted to ask what the military officers' expectations were as to what 

reasons Spierzeig Verret would not move.

With not much time left until my next contact with the target, I ask a few 

quick questions.

"They must think the General has arrived."

The young military officer replied without much trouble.

"Your grandfather?"

"Yes. The Spierzeig side would think that only General Galfis would ...... be willing to make such an assault."

After stating his reasons, the military officer readied his spear and prepared to make contact with the enemy. To keep him focused on the fight, I signal the end of our conversation with a hand gesture.

As I focused my attention on my hearing to confirm the military officer's words, I heard the words "red devil" and "Galfis" all over the enemy unit.

I felt that the military officer was not quite wrong.

In fact, I am running a street operation without a military flag, so the enemy can't immediately determine who the captain of Wilk's unit is.

For Spierzeig's army, Grandfather Galfis is the nobleman who fights the most. His valiant and daring leadership may be best understood by the enemy soldiers.

Since I was going to the trouble, I shot a red flame toward the sky in an attempt to incite their fear. I was imitating my grandfather.

"Oh, oh, oh, it's the Red Devil!"

"Help me! I don't want to die!"

"No! I don't want to!"

"Giyaaah!"

The performance was so effective that the enemy soldiers fell into a state of panic, frightened by the shadow of their grandfather, who was not supposed to be there.

Watching their frightened appearance, I couldn't help but be aware of the existence of demons.

It is believed that on the continent of Eruo, there are monsters that have mutated into humans and possess vicious powers.

They say that its skin turns an inhuman color, its fangs grow out of its mouth, its claws grow sharp and black, and its eyes shine in the dark night.

Then, a total of three black horns, two from either side of the back of the head and one from the forehead, like those of the Atlas longhorned beetle, sprout from the back of the head.

The Quardenze family has a painting that depicts the monster devouring a human child. The monster in the painting was bathed in the blood of the child and its skin was dyed red, somewhat reminiscent of Japanese demons.

Since then, I have translated that monster in my brain as "ogre."

Red devil. That was my grandfather's nickname.

The sharp eyes, fiery red hair, muscular body still over 80 years old, and the magical power and spectacular prowess of the main ancestor. Perhaps it is inevitable that people exposed to these threats would see glimpses of the "monster" in their grandfather's figure.

With a thinner force, the followers of that unit were also easily defeated.

I point to the next target and pull the reins.

"After all, my grandfather is used to this level of assault." I thought to myself, "Not the generation that knows the turbulent times in the western part of the continent," but the military officer quickly dismissed my words.

"No, I don't think even the generals would have made an assault of this magnitude."

"Is that so?"

"Even in the case of rapid maneuvering, we have at least 1,000 men at our disposal. What I said earlier was only a matter of impression."

If the main ancestral army of the Kuordenze family came as reinforcements, the Spiaseik army would assume that the head of the family, Quardenze Luke, or his legitimate son, Quardenze Wilk, was the general-in-chief.

However, the main ancestral army, with less than 50 men, launched an assault and killed the knights one after another. What would the military officers of Spierzeig's army assume when they saw this scene?

How could Luke, the head of the family, who had never shown much in the way of military prowess, and Wilk, his heir, who had just completed his first campaign in the city of Nambonan, be capable of such an assault operation?

"...... No, that is not possible. If so, by no means, is it Galfis returning from the front? How is that possible? But it wouldn't be too surprising if he was the only one who thought that he was the main ancestor of the Quardenze who could make that kind of assault,......"

And if my grandfather were here, that would be the worst situation for Spierzeig's army.

It is not a simple question of force, for it means that the separate Spierzeig forces surrounding the outpost have either retreated or been destroyed.

If things go badly, it is even conceivable that the Quardenze forces returning from the frontline base could show up after this and be pinched. The main ancestral army of the Spierzeik family is probably in retreat in order to retreat quickly in case of an emergency.

"I see."

It is a very gratifying thing that the Spierzeig side is able to increase the war results of the Wilk team thanks to the image of their grandfather, which they have inflated on their own.

I'll keep the military flag I brought with me hidden like this, instead of flying it for a while.

"Contact. Beware."

"I understand," he said. "There are two follower soldiers here. Make sure you kill them."

"Hah!"

Perhaps because they had already seen how many units had been crushed, the commoners immediately began to panic as soon as we charged in.

The weapon wielded by the military officer dug into the body of the commander, who was struggling to hold together the soldiers who were trying to flee in pieces, and tore into them. It was a scene that had already been repeated many times, as if we were watching a repeat replay.

The young men who lead the group in rotation are covered in the blood and guts of many people, and by all accounts are dangerous.

It is no wonder that the commoners were horrified when these men charged at them, wielding spears and yelling.

"That's next."

As he says this, pointing his finger at the next candidate for demolition, the knight Gatoren interjects.

"Aiming is good, but the front is not. Let's go around and bite through the side."

Looking at the troops spread out on both sides, a frontal breakthrough seemed the best course of action, no matter how one looked at it.

The commander seems to have difficulty in arranging the disorder of his troops, and the front is the thinnest defended.

"......Why? That area is densely populated with soldiers and looks hard to break through. Wouldn't it be better to cut through as we have done so far, targeting areas where the troops are thin?"

I couldn't help but hear back a slightly annoyed tone of voice.

Commoner soldiers can be easily crushed, but too much of them could stop a horse in its tracks.

It is not only soft Yakuza flesh that is in enemy units, but also hard metal armor and weapons.

"The front is a trap. This unit's ability to break through is tremendous, but there is nothing we can do to stop them."

Knight Gatoren speaks with conviction and gives several examples of how to stop the Wilk forces.

It was less like a sermon and more like the narrative of a teacher with access to quality teaching materials.

"The commander of that unit is the knight Zannaholus. He is a brilliant adversary who can make the best moves in such a short period of time. If we rush in as they invite us, we may be entangled."

"Tell me more."

Knight Gatoren nodded briefly and continued his story.

The enemy has made its best move, but it is only the best move in an inferior position. They are leading us into a frontal attack for one reason: their forces, which are less mobile, will not be able to deal with us in time if we don't narrow down our aim.

The horses of the Wilk team are very mobile because they are strengthened by my magic, and they can easily change direction because they are small in number.

This is like a pitcher who throws a variety of breaking pitches in addition to his fastball. To get a hit, you need to focus on the target.

"The knight Zannaholus wanted a straight down the middle, and he blatantly struck out ...... to entice me, the pitcher, to make his soldiers look thin. I was about to fall for it."

"The enemy is preparing to intercept in case of a frontal attack. Then ......"

"So you want me to miss the target."

"That's right."

It is a good idea to focus on the target, but at worst, it is a strategy with a strong element of gamble, as it is left up to the opponent and if it misses, the game is over.

The goal of Operation Street Devil is to defeat the followers of Spierzeig's army, and my thinking is not so muscular as to want to ignore that and challenge them to a head-to-head power game.

I accepted the knight Gatoren's advice and tried to modify the assault point. 

After all, a rice cake is a rice cake shop.

If we can take him down here, it will have a big impact.

"...... knight Zannaholus?"

The Zannaholus are undoubtedly the first of the many knightly families that serve the Spierzeig family. If we were to compare it to the Quardenze family, it is similar to the position of the Gatoren family.

If the first knight could be defeated, the impact would be very great. So much so that the nobles in the vicinity would be convinced that the Spierzeig family's operation had failed.

I give instructions to my allies as advised by the knight Gatoren.

The Wilk squad, which had been running toward the front, forcefully changed direction at my signal and charged into the flank of the enemy unit.

The Wilk squad, pierced like a river blow, knocked down a thick wall of soldiers.

"GWAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

"Hi! Stop it!"

The morale of the commoners had collapsed. However, the morale of the commoners was irrelevant in terms of blocking the progress of the Wilkes team.

When the leading military officer slowed down, it was the knight Gatoren who stepped forward as a replacement.

Beyond it, the knight Zannaholus can be seen.

The knight Gatoren spread his arms wide in search of my body enhancement magic and held up a large sword with a very long sword blade.

From my position, I cannot see the expression on the face of the knight Gatoren running in front of me. But a moment later, I realized that they had exchanged glances.

I will speak no more.

"Gatooooooorennnnnnnnnnnnnn ！！！！"

Knight Gatoren and knight Zannaholus, if their positions were similar, their ages were also about the same.

The assault of the Wilkes team resembles a tsunami. It swallows up everything in its path, without regard to the traces of life and the history of the people.

Their fate, which would have lasted for decades, was decided in just a few seconds.

Looking back, there is nothing but blood-soaked earth.

Without looking back at all, the knight Gatoren kicks away the soldiers in front of him and makes his way out.

As he exits the unit led by knight Zannaholus, knight Gatoren speaks to him.

"May I?"

"Is it time to pull the plug?"

I look at Gatoren, who says shortly, "Yes," and I confirm the position of the main army.

He still seemed to be mulling around in the back of the room, and there seemed to be plenty of room for more.

"The enemy has nothing to do with it."

Then he continues with a sincerely apologetic look on his face.

"This is Young Master's strengthening magic, but if we terminate it now, we may not be able to do more than kneel on the battlefield. ...... since it has been going on for quite a while."

"I didn't notice that. Has it been that long?"

The knight Gatoren answered yes without hesitation. Apparently, he was so intoxicated by the excitement of the battlefield that he had lost his sense of time.

This time, while knights are being reinforced as needed, the military officers are being reinforced at all times. This is because we judged that it is more efficient to continue strengthening military officers, who are combatants, from the beginning to the end of the process.

If the reinforcement is continued over a long period of time, the repercussions when it is terminated are great. Knight Gatoren estimates that the military officers may faint if they are not properly trained.

We have already had more than enough success," he said. We have more knights in service than we can count on two hands, including the knight Zannaholus.

Spierzeig's army had placed many knights in the northern part of the city of Nambonan.

This is because if the main ancestral army of the Quardenze family is coming, it will most likely come from the northeast of the city.

The mainland army is fast on its feet, if not as fast as the Wilk forces this time around.

It is safer to have a commander in place who is competent enough to make decisions and act quickly, assuming that the Quardenze forces will appear from the northeast.

As a result, the Wilk forces succeeded in taking out knight Zannaholus and other knights and young military officers who would lead the next generation one after another. From Spierzeig's point of view, everything backfired.

Although defeating the current knight does not immediately destroy the knight's family, the death of the head of the family will probably disrupt the family for a while. It would be difficult to launch a large-scale military action.

"Then we'll pull back. Give the order."

"Ha!"

Knight Gatoren's expression softened a bit when I gave the order to retreat. I guess they were relieved that I decided to pull out as originally planned.

"Raise the flag! This battle, we have won!"

The military flag is raised with shouts of victory from the excited warriors. It fluttered strongly as if boasting of victory.

Snakes entwined in crossed spears and the splashing of a great river. It is also called the Quardenze crest.

The flag I brought this time had a simplified Quardenze crest design. It was painted on green cloth with blue threads, and was a banner for householders with no special status.

When we raised the flag, the surrounding Quardenze soldiers cheered.

"WOW!"


"We won! We won! We won! We won! We won!"

"YEAH!!!!"

Are they drafted citizen soldiers who continue to raise their voices even when their voices are half withered?

The way everyone was praising me as if they were exclaiming, it was like a baby who was relieved to have a protector rather than rejoicing in victory.

Before long, a number of citizens were climbing the city walls, jumping up and down and rejoicing in their victory.

The voice of Hail Nambonan eventually changed to Hail Quardenze, and then to Hail Mayor. 

Perhaps someone with knowledge of the aristocratic community saw the military flag we were flying and told them who the general was.

There are no longer any Spierzeig soldiers trying to stop us from joining up with our friends.

The enemy soldiers open the street as if they were rejoicing that the calamity is leaving.

He made his triumphant return on an empty street, leisurely, receiving applause from the soldiers and citizens. The scene was that of a leading actor basking in the spotlight at the center of the theater.

All that was left was to wait for the curtain to come down on the stage and the play to end. 

However, someone had an objection to the script.

"Young Master ......!"

If I were to enter a sauna with a body that does not feel heat, I might feel this way. It is suffocating and oppressive, and your whole body complains that you do not want to stay here.

It was clearly a wave of killing intent directed at me personally.

"Yeah, I'm aware."

This was the first time I had ever been directly threatened by the main ancestor, and I cringed for a moment at the concentrated discomfort. But that doesn't matter once you get used to it, and in a way it is refreshing because I have never lived a life where I have been the target of ill will.

"You seem very angry."

I understood the wavering menace radiating from Spierzeig Verret.

In a sense, the emotional release of magic has an effect similar to telepathy. 

It is possible to sense the other person's emotional disturbance.

It is no longer killing intent that is contained in Verret's threats. It is rage.

"They are coming this way! Young Master!"

When I visually checked the main ancestral army, it was just beginning its vigorous descent from a small hill southwest of the city.

The surrounding Quardenze forces are shifting their formation like shields to protect the Wilk forces and are trying to prepare for that assault.

The knights and military officers verbally advised them to retreat and join the others. They probably do not want to clash with Verret with a small force.

The main ancestral army led by Verret has only about 5,000 soldiers at most, and the number of soldiers in the Quardenze army that will greet them is several times as large.

Many of the troops who had been disintegrated by Wilk's assault were scattered, and many of them did not join the enemy forces and watched the situation unfold.

Spierzeig's troops deployed in the southern and western parts of the city are also approaching, but either way, there is no doubt that our numbers are superior.

If I attack while surrounding Verret and looking for an opening, I might be able to take its head off.

"My name is Spierzeig Verret! You coward, come forward fair and square!"

"You're a coward!"

Verrett said this out loud as he descended the hill and confronted the 

Quardenze forces.

Because of the magic to magnify the voice, even I can hear it well from far 

away.

"You're young. You're so angry you can't see what's going on around you."

"It would be a knight to admonish them."

"That's exactly right."

"What are the knights who were stationed in the camp doing?"

The knights and military officers around me spoke bitterly of those under their command who did not admonish them rather than the individual Verret who had suddenly descended the hill.

Aristocrats...... find it difficult to educate the Lord's ancestors. It is said that if the discipline is not right, the ancestors, who boast overwhelming magical power, often grow up to be haughty, and it is not unusual for them to run amok when they are young because of their all-powerful nature.

Knights and military officers are also expected to rebuke such young nobles for running amok and show them the right path.

Verrett was making a lot of noise and throwing scornful words at Quardenze, but he did not launch a strong attack.

I don't know if the knights under his command are holding back or if Verret just doesn't have the guts to do it.

"Do you remember how old Spierzeig Verret was?"

"I believe it was ......18 or 19."

Knight Gatoren, who was listening to the exchange between me and the military officer, adds a few words.

"He is 19 years old. He will have a hard time remonstrating if he is the next head of ...... the kingdom, but he is not qualified to be a knight if he cannot get the young lord to back down here."

For a knight, being the next head of a noble family is a delicate existence. It is because he or she has one foot in the realm of the lord.

When he eventually becomes the head of the family, he will not be able to talk if he is only looking at the knight's face. That is why he must have the capacity to make risky decisions, sometimes overcoming the opinions of the knights.

When the next head of the family makes decisions in strong terms, it is very difficult for the knight to reject them. This is because it may narrow the degree of the future lord.

If you look at Verrett, who has now jumped to the front lines, you can imagine that he has been angrily shouting at the knights to go out to battle.

After all, as the knight Gatoren said, this is a scene that should be admonished at all costs. The victory has already been decided, and as a knight, the safety of the next head of the family must come first.

This would never have happened if the knight Zannaholus had lived, the knight Gatoren, the one who had slaughtered him, let slip a little.

"What's the matter, Quardenze? Are you afraid to step forward! What happened to all that energy you had earlier?"

Verrett continues to be a sore loser who can't stand to hear it.

Perhaps they must have planned to use this counter-offensive operation to make the military name of Spierzeig Verret a household name and a foil to their own.

The attack on Nambonan City, with a number of heavy knights as assistants, at least, they must not have thought they would be beaten to a pulp.

No matter how strong the words are, there is no anger in hearing them, considering the fact that he has lost a number of knights under his command. 

In fact, it is even pathetic.

"I want to ask you one question: do you think the angry magic he's been sending out since a few minutes ago is full force?"

One of the military officers answers my question.

"Perhaps. Would it be difficult to control so much angry intimidation?"

From the pressure of the magic mixed with rage, I think of Verret's strength. 

I have no doubt that he is a member of the main ancestors and holds a vast amount of magical power that cannot be compared to that of knights and the like.

But as to whether I am really afraid of it, the answer is no. I felt that I could defeat it without difficulty if I fought it single-handedly.

And I haven't even told the knights this, but I've been secretly working on a plan since I arrived on the battlefield.

"Quardenze's miasma! Are you afraid of me! Can't you even talk to me?

As I listened to Verrett's blustering words, I wondered why Verrett had come to the front lines now.

I can think of only one answer to that question. I came forward because I was convinced that my grandfather Galfis was not here.

If Grandfather had been here, the knights would have decided to hold Verrett back and retreat at all costs.

There is absolutely no way that he would allow a young, inexperienced lord to stand in front of his grandfather, who is a veteran of a hundred battles. 

Even if it was the order of the next head of the family.

So I dared them to raise the military flag at the end.

The Spierzeig family is naturally aware of the family structure of the rival noble families. Verret, the knights under his command, and the military officers must have seen the green and blue Quardenze crest and understood who was leading the Wilk forces.

This gives Verret no reason to hesitate.

If it is not Galfis, the red devil, but a legitimate son of the Quardenze family who has just recently made his first battle, there is no need to be afraid.

The general of the enemy force is just a little boy, and the reason the unthinking assault went well is because the knights assisting him are very skilled. I don't know how far the ...... furious Verrett thought about it. But if he had insisted on something like this, could the knight really have refused 

Veretto's departure?

It is clear from the fire that if they continue to flee back to Spierzeig territory, they are sure to lose and then be left in a dilemma.

The only way left for Verret to win is to turn the tables on Quardenze Wilk, who has come out of the woodwork with his agitation.

Thus, Verret came to the forefront. No, it would be better to say that we were able to lure him out.

"It wouldn't look good to run away."

When I said this, not only the knights but even the military officers' faces became tense.

"We don't need to hear the words of the losers."

Then they all surround me and start lecturing me.

If I left in this situation, there was a high possibility that it would lead to a 

one-on-one fight, which was unacceptable. They knew that Verret's goal was my head.

But my aim is also on Verrett's neck.

"If it came down to a one-on-one fight, who do you think would win? I won't be 

offended if you answer. As long as it's an honest answer."

The military officer looked away at the question, and the knight's expression 

became even more grim as he looked at me.

They don't think much of me losing. They are the ones who know the most about my magical power, which far surpasses that of my adult ancestors.

But I'm at a loss for words because if I answer that truthfully, I'm going to get my groove on and go beat Verrett to a pulp.

Even if I had overwhelming magical power, victory is not absolute when dealing with the main ancestor.

This is because even in a fight between a man with a submachine gun and a man with a blade, there is no guarantee that the former will win 100% of the time.

"........................ has been well received. There is no need for you to go to great lengths. ......"

I had to convince the anxious knight who kept missing shots and then only looked at the possibility of being stabbed in the chest with a knife.

Since I have not yet been named as the next head of the family, I can't force him to agree to a risky decision.

If that is the case, we can lower the risk against single combat, and on the other hand, put them on the anxious side against avoiding it.

"I'm angry."

"Do not let such inconsequential nonsense disturb your mind."

Knight Gatoren, who probably thought I was offended by Verret's abusive language, admonished me in a strong tone.

It is natural to scold a young lord for being provocative, and it is the knight's ring. I would not set up a contest in such a place.

I slowly dismiss the sermon and continue with my words.

"I'm not going to let a man who put my women in danger and sent them out to 

kill me get away with it. I can't stand it."

It can be expected that Anna, Kohari, Rave and others have already evacuated to the interior. There should be no civilian officials in Nambonan City who would cut corners in that area.

But maybe they missed their opportunity and failed to escape. They may be trembling with fear of the aristocrats' murderous intent to attack the city of Nambonan.

I was not so intensely angry that my mind went blank, but I was genuinely remembering a hazy, smoldering anger.

"But ......"

"How can you call yourself a man? What kind of face am I supposed to put on when I meet Anna, Kohari, and Rave? If I can't stand up to him here, I'm going to lose my confidence as a man."

The knights were at a loss for words.

To be clear, I don't have such a sensitive heart. If I ever lose my confidence, I'll probably ask for comfort in bed.

But the worried knights are afraid that I will be turned off by this incident to women. It makes me mad to think of the trouble they must be going through. I said something that the knights would have had trouble dealing with. And it was more effective than I had imagined.

And I have a plan.

I remove the contents from the cloth bag in my pocket and hand it to the knight Gatoren in the palm of my hand.

It was a new mana crystal from the city of Nambonan. One the size of an AA battery, it was already filled with my magic power.

The mana mine, now owned by the Quardenze family, is already back in operation.

If you think I'm in danger, feel free to use it. Even my ancestor could be harmed. If it is a surprise attack, so much the better."

This was a persuasive factor against the knight, but I also needed it for my own peace of mind.

Whatever the case may be, it is true that I am afraid of single combat. We want to make sure we have insurance.

When the knight Gatoren received the mana crystal, his eyes widened when he saw the enormous magical power contained in it.

"But such a move would damage the young master's reputation ......."

"There's nothing wrong with that."

It is not a theory that there is no such thing as cowardice or shit in a game. 

Even if we were to win by surprise, there would be no problem.

"Assuming we win this one, ...... who would believe the Spierzeiks' side of the story?"

The Spierzeik family's operation has already failed.

He lost his knights, he lost his military officers, and he failed to capture the city. This is an absolute certainty.

Here the Spierzeiks said, "Our son was killed by surprise. The Quardenze 

knight intervened in the middle of single combat. The Quardenze Wilk is a 

coward. Will anyone really believe it?"

"Oh, ......, that they're claiming the lie that the other side was cowardly in order to cover up the fact that the operation failed. The reality of a great defeat turns even the truth into a falsehood. It is the winner, Quardenze, who makes the facts, and killing Verrett by cowardly means will not bring it to light. No, it will be put away as the nonsense of the losers.

I, of course, spread that fabricated truth. I will spread the pathetic and miserable lies of the Spierzeik family throughout the continent using the Nambonan merchant network."

The more noise the Spierzeik family makes, the more they are laughed at by those around them.

When I explained my reasons, the knight Gatoren started looking for a counterargument, but it never came up. The same goes for the surrounding knights.

Given the large number of Quardenze soldiers deployed around me and the presence of mana crystals for surprise attacks, they thought they could rescue me before I was mortally wounded, even if I was outnumbered.

The main ancestor has a strong life force and will not die so easily unless he is very careless. It would be the first thing to take my life in this situation.

"I understand."

The seesaw tilted to the side of "yes" or "no".

I am not likely to lose considering the amount of magic I have, I can stop Veretto by surprise even if I am outnumbered, he can rescue me in the meantime, the life force of the main ancestor is not low enough to be killed instantly, there will be no negative effects even if I win by surprise, and I may become impotent if I back out of the game at this point. And if we could defeat Verret, the Spierzeig family would be dealt an irreversible blow. ...... These are the ingredients that got me on the side of acceptability.

The weight of the knight's decision seemed to be able to change his decision 

as well.

"Knight Gatoren, chaperone."

"Ha!"

I returned my clenched fist to the praying eyes of the knight and the military 

officer and pulled back on the reins.

"You're out, Quardenze."

Slowly, as if taking each step, he moves forward under the gaze of the soldiers.

The front line was a side-by-side standoff between the Quardenze and Spierzeig armies, which seemed to be a multi-line flower battle.

On the border between the two armies is a 200 meter blank area where two men are riding and waiting.

I turned my eyes toward the young man and enhanced my vision to see his appearance.

Spierzeig Verret.

He is a legitimate son of the Spierzeig family and a nobleman who has been nominated as the next head of the family.

The sharp eyes and thin eyebrows give the impression of a sharp blade.

Perhaps it is because I perceive them as enemies, but I honestly don't think they are people I can get along with very well.

The word "pissed off young man" came to mind, probably due to the angry threats that have become stronger since I showed up.

The man next to him is a knight.

Knight Gatoren stands beside me and tells me the name of the family of the man standing next to Verret.

I let it slide and focused on Verrett again.

Just as no one cares about the claws of a cat next to a tiger, no one cares about a mere knight in front of the overwhelming presence of the main ancestor.

I stopped my horse at about 25 meters from Verret.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Spierzeig."

I follow Verret's lead and activate the loudspeaker magic. My voice spread as if I were speaking through outdoor speakers.

The surrounding soldiers seem to be watching with bated breath as the nobles talk, a strange hush enveloping their surroundings as they exchange words.

As we continued our checks and balances in the name of greetings, Verrett spat in an exasperated tone.

"......, you're playing it pretty sloppy, aren't you?"

I'm not playing hard to get.

So I stopped speaking and spread my arms exaggeratedly before continuing.

"I just can't afford it."

In response to these words, Verret lost the expression he had been keeping and became angry.

"Don't be conceited, you worm ......!"

The surrounding soldiers are momentarily silenced, frightened by the thick magic of the overflowing anger.

Verrett's anger seems to be at its peak.

You seem to be in a good mood after defeating my vassal, but you are just a child who can do nothing without the support of the knight Gatoren.

I moved my head so Verret could see it and looked at Gatoren, the knight next to me. As if to impress upon him that he is a weak child who relies on the knight to make the crucial decisions.

Verret, who as expected did not miss it, was in an amusingly good mood and raised his voice high.

"Ha ha ha! It's my own damn fault for coming out here with hubris!"

"I didn't expect Spierzeig to point out my lack of luck."

"There is nothing more stupid than a child's bluff!"

If Verret dies here, the rest of the knights in Spierzeig's army are on a martyr's course.

This would mean the complete destruction of the Spiaseik forces responsible for the invasion of Nambonan City.

I can honestly say that I was very lucky because I did not expect this guy to get on so well. Conversely, the Spierzeik family has had no luck.

"Don't think you can get away with this, Quardenze Wilk!"

With his loudest cry, Verret raised the spear he was holding high into the sky. This was a signal to challenge him to a duel.

On the continent of Eruo, one does not throw the glove down when challenging someone to a duel.

Basically, it is a really straightforward "kill and you win," but only the starting 

move is fixed.

They raise the weapon they are holding and loudly announce their name, 

affiliation, and who they are challenging to a duel.

"Heir to the protection of the Great Voistra! Spiaseik Verrett, heir apparent to 

the Spiaseik family! I challenge Quardenze Wilk to a duel!"

The commoners of Quardenze and Spierzeig were excited at the prospect of a duel between the nobles, and began to roar and make noise.

Verrett checks the excitement of the soldiers who have become spectators, and continues in a voice just loud enough to reach us.

"If you run, I'll cut your back."

Note that just because you are offered a duel does not mean you have to accept it.

In fact, it is not necessary for the other party to agree to a request for a duel. It is more like a declaration of war.

Even if I stand there silently, Verret will slash at me sooner or later.

If you refuse and they attack you, you have no choice but to fight. You could say that the duel has already begun.

"Fu......"

I sighed deeply, gripped the spear tightly, and held it straight out to the side. 

It was similar to a bunt stance, except that I didn't lean forward with my face close to it.

When you make this posture and state that you will accept a duel, you are starting a single combat, both in name and in reality.

"As the protector of Nambonan, I will avenge the bandits! Quardenze Wilk, the heir to the Quardenze family! Here I come!"

As soon as he finished saying this, both horses began to run, neither one first.

Knight Gatoren, and the knights who had been with Verrett, remained on standby as the main players in this battle moved closer to the center of the spotlight.

I guess we both think things are going our way, and I'm hiding it, but there was a smile on the other's face.

Verrett postures to spear me, and I swing my spear wide like a hitter trying 

to hit a home run.

"Quardenzeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I kneaded my magic while receiving the wave of Verret's killing intent.

I have never issued a real threat since I arrived on this battlefield.

The reason for this was that if they were to engage in single combat, he planned to activate it at the moment they crossed their spears to flinch their opponents.

Yes, it was all for this moment.

I know because I received it just a few minutes ago. Verret's threat was only slight, but there was enough pressure to make me shrug.

And Verret has yet to be intimidated by me.

--- Kill.

He mixed his darkest emotions with his magic power and emitted them out of his body with all his might.

"What?"

Instantly, I felt a vicious wave of vibrations radiate through the earth.

The battlefield, crowded with tens of thousands of soldiers, is so silent that even time is frozen.

My enormous magical power and killing intent succeeds in successfully stiffening Verrett's body.

A gray world, less than a few tenths of a second. I aimed the tip of my swinging spear at Verret's neck and swung my arm.

In the frozen time, the tip of the spear I wield goes in a curved line.

What exactly did Verret want to say in those words?

But it can no longer be known forever. The tip of the spear cuts right across the source of that voice.

The sensation of cutting through the flesh of the main ancestor, transmitted to the palm of the hand. It was like breaking a piece of rubber that had been hardened to the utmost limit.

I swung my spear to the end as if to shake off the unpleasant sensation of the life force of the main ancestor, its pulsating pulse.

The spear was swung at an angle, and Verret's head was launched high into the sky. If it were baseball, it would have been a pitcher's fly.

If you look at the blood-colored tip of the spear, the metal is rotting as if it had been burned.

Maybe I wanted to distract myself from the fact that I had killed a human being directly with a weapon and not with magic, I was talking to myself, not to anyone else.

No one could utter a word, and could only watch the object launch into the evening sky.

When the fresh head, which attracted the attention of the crowd, hit the ground, Verret's torso slyly fell from the horse, as if the impact had been felt.

Even the Lord's ancestors, as expected, would not be able to live if their heads were separated from their bodies.

Time moves again with the head rolling on the sunset-tinted earth, the crumpled shell of Verret, and the revelation of the end of it all.

Now we have to put the finishing touches on it.

"Annihilate! Smash the Spierzeig!"

Before I could finish, the sound of explosions echoed from the surrounding area. The Quardenze forces had launched an all-out attack.

"The goal is the Spierzeig's army."

Most of the enemy commoners seemed to have been stunned as a result of my threats at close range, and could not even serve as a meat wall.

Since the Quardenze forces outnumber the Quardenze in the number of followers, not to mention the simple number of soldiers, they would not be defeated even without my reinforcement.

"I hope you're all right. Are you injured? ......"

The knight Gatoren approaches me.

The knight attached to Verret was attacked by another soldier.

"I'm fine. We haven't had a single attack."

"I was so close to the threat," he said. "Undo it immediately."

My opinion is silenced and I am immediately subjected to a spell to break the 

spell.

One of the troublesome aspects of fighting against people with magical powers is that the residue of magical power accumulates in the body.

When fighting a battle in which magic clashes with magic, even if the wounds are healed, there may be residual foreign magic in the body, which in turn may cause poor physical condition.

The ailment is not limited to after the battle, but as one ages, the adverse effects come back like old wounds, causing pain in the body and making it impossible to move satisfactorily.

This becomes more pronounced if the battle is between the main ancestors, and if they are not very good, they can become paralyzed.

For the Lord Ancestor, who has always been in good health, ill health caused by magical residues is in a sense his only illness, and is greatly feared.

This is also the reason why he is cautious about fighting against noblemen, even though he is a nobleman who is willing to fight against magical beasts.

Undoing magic is simply the magic that removes the magical residue left in the body, and its effects can be lessened if it is performed before it settles in the body. I don't think there is any magical residue at the level of intimidation, but I want to make sure that it is handled properly for my old age. It is a kind of organizing exercise.

Unfortunately, this had to be done by someone other than myself, so I decided to ask the knight Gatoren to unscramble it as it was.

"We're going to move backwards to make sure the curse is lifted."

"I guess so. I'm a little tired."

I was mentally exhausted from running all day and from standing around with the mainlanders, even though I was confident we could win.

Plus, I still have the sickening sensation of the cut of Verrett's flesh in my palm.

I left the front line with the knight Gatoren leading the way.

A tent is set up in the center of the camp created by the main force of the Nambonan City defense.

As soon as the knight Gatoren and I entered the tent, the military officers adopted a posture of bowing with a sense of composure.

The battle situation is completely in the hands of the Quardenze forces. The knights were prepared to die as martyrs when their general, Verret, was killed, but they were outnumbered and were defeated one by one.

The morale of the Spierzeig soldiers was completely destroyed, and those who were conscious only fled to avoid being caught up in the fighting of the followers.

"Long live Nambonan!"

"Long live Quordenze!"

"Long live the mayor!"

"Ooooh!"

I sat down in the chair provided, listening to the distant shouts of victory from the Quardenze army.

"Young Master, come in."

He handed me a cup of slightly lukewarm tea. After taking a sip, he realized that he was thirsty and immediately asked for another cup.

"...... are those guys okay?"

"He's just out cold. He'll wake up soon."

The tent was one step ahead of the Wilk Corps military officers who had been brought in.

In order to fight a one-on-one battle with Verret, we broke off the reinforcement magic against them, whereupon they all fainted.

Looking at the bodies of the military officers lined up like tuna in a fish market, I could see their chests moving as they breathed. I was relieved to see that they did not appear to be dead.

"Well done, young master!"

The military officer who brought another cup of tea said so, and the other military officers around him began to recount the whole story of the duel.

It is not every day that a duel between nobles and aristocrats takes place.

For a military officer who yearns for strength, the duel was unsettling, but it also tugged at his heartstrings.

"I don't know if you have time to talk here. We cannot allow ourselves to be 

distracted on the battlefield. Do not forget that the general is still fighting in 

the west."

"Ha! Shhh, excuse me!"

After a glare from the knight Gatoren, who put his hand on my back and cast a spell to break the spell, the military officers quickly returned to their work.

"Now that complete victory in Nambonan City has been confirmed, we must not be complacent. We won't be leaving immediately because we have to prepare, but after this we will have reinforcements for my grandfather.:"

While we were having a simple meal with tea, a military officer came from outside the tent.

It appears that they are reporting the status of the war, but they do not seem to be in a hurry, and even seem to be relaxed.

After a reasonable amount of time, the battlefield must have settled down.

"What's the battlefield like?"

"Young Master! ...... and excuse me! I would like to report on the war situation. We have now succeeded in capturing all the commoners, as well as a few knights and military officers of Spierzeig."

"Oh, there was a man with a name."

Basically, knights and military officers are often killed on the spot.

If this were a historical simulation game in which the goal is to unify the country, it would be possible to promote captured military officers, but this is not possible on the continent of Eruo.

Because of the lineage relationship between the main and second ancestors, nobles and knights have a pseudo parent-child relationship, and a child will never betray his parents, and conversely, no one will trust a knight who betrays his parents and joins another family.

When a Spiaseik knight says, "The main family is about to lose, so I'm going to switch sides," my father, of course, doesn't trust him, and neither do I. 

Deep down, he must have sworn allegiance to the Spierzeig family.

If a knight or military officer is worth the high ransom the Spierzeig family is prepared to pay, he may be taken prisoner, but a squire's prisoner is troublesome to manage because he may escape at any moment without a magical seal.

The fact that they went to the trouble of capturing him means that there must have been a useful knight.

"No, they are not prisoners of war, but for interrogation, because they might learn the full extent of the operation that the Spierzeik family has set up."

"It's a long shot, though", says the military officer.

Given the loyalty of the knight, he would not talk so much when tortured. At least I don't think he would throw up in a day or two.

You might be able to push them to the brink of death for days and finally get them to vomit, but that would take too long.

The idea was to just listen for now, and if not, kill them.

"One is a prisoner of war. She is a woman."

Another military officer, who was listening to the conversation, adds a supplementary comment from the side.

"Hmm?" You got a girl?"

One exception is the case of knights and military officers who are also prisoners of war. That is the case of women.

To increase the number of followers without nobles, it is necessary to conduct breeding activities with followers and followers.

A squire woman born into a knightly family is expected to bear children anyway to protect the family. This is the squire's resurrections.

Worst of all, there is no problem if there is one, since the sexual desire of the male squire is almost the same as that of the commoner. What is important is the number of bellies of the squire.

That is why captive  women are useful as child-bearing machines. 

For them, however, it is hell on earth, as they are raped and even impregnated 

by their master's enemies.

"Which knight? A military officer?"

"Knight Shikinaon."

"I knew the name of the Shikinaon family, but I thought the active knight was male."

I say exactly what I feel, and the military officer responds immediately.

General Galfis must have lost a candidate because he killed the knight Shikinaon one after the other. It seems that there are not enough squires to make a young girl a knight.

"Ho ......"

Only a squire can be a knight.

The knights who support the Spierzeig family, which continues to be outnumbered, also seem to be having a hard time.

"What's your name?"

"Shikinaon Rosé. Shall I take you to ...... there?"

He is a military officer who can really read the air.

He must have been a military officer working for the city of Nambonan, so he may have overheard somewhere that I was a womanizer.

I answered yes to that question, and without a pause, several military officers brought the knight Shikinaon in.

Her armor was blackened and chipped in places. Half of her cloak was burned off, as if she had been hit by fire magic.

She must have been wounded during the capture, for her thighs and flanks, which had been ripped open and the cloth exposed, were covered with blood. 

If it were not for her physical strength, she would have been seriously injured and unable to move.

"In the presence of the young master! Face up!"

The warrior kicked the knight Shikinaon roughly in the head, causing her helmet to come off and roll away.

A clank, clank, clank, and the sound of metal echoed.

The helmet is removed, and the long hair housed inside hangs down to the ground in a sloppy manner.

She had beautiful, long blonde hair that was ill-suited to the battlefield.

The military officer grabbed her hair as if he was holding a rope and pulled it forcibly, forcing her to turn her face toward me.

The knight Shikinaon was a young girl, perhaps around 18 years old.

The armor makes it difficult to see the lines of her body, but a quick glance reveals a slender beauty. If I had to choose between cute and beautiful, I would say that she is definitely a beautiful woman.

She has a sharp jawline and beautiful silver eyes with a strong sense of will.

This is a top ball.

I can feel the excitement of the battle gathering in my groin.

Yes, I prefer the act of creating humans to the act of killing humans.

The knight Shikinaon seems to have realized who I am.

She stared at me with a piercing gaze and let his words trail off in bitterness.

"Damn ......!"

Chapter 168 - Deliciously serving a female knight in the service of a sworn enemy (1/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Quardenze ......!"

The military officers around him harden their expressions at the tone of his voice, which makes no attempt to hide his disgust.

When the military officer holding her hair lifted his arm to censure her attitude, her face contorted in pain.

"Identify yourself, girl."

I slump in my chair and throw words at the knight Shikinaon in a high-handed manner.

In the presence of Quardenze's military officers and soldiers here, there is no way to show her a lenient attitude.

"I am not just a girl! I am Shikinaon Rose, heir to the knightly name given to me by the Spierzeig family!"

She answered my question in a crisp and clear voice. I could feel her pride as a knight in the service of the Spierzeig family.

"Rosé."

I dare to call her Rosé, since she doesn't like to be treated as just a girl.

Rosé's face showed her anger at our mocking attitude, but she did not become

agitated and continued to speak.

"You have captured me because you wanted to know the Master's and Grand

Master's movements, but that is in vain. I would never betray the Lord's Household."

Her attitude, in which she made her words so clearly, was refreshing, as if she was loyal as the head of the Shikinaon family.

"How old are you?"

"I won't answer your questions, Quardenze."

She wriggled her bound body and straightened her posture. Even if she is captured by the enemy, she is careful to behave as a knight, which suggests that she is a daughter who was raised with a solid education.

One of the military officers yells at Rosé for her rejection, but she remains pouting and unmoving.

Her resolute appearance did not waver even when her hair was pulled or her head was kicked, and she just stared at me silently with a dignified expression on her face.

I was deeply wounded and stained with mud and blood, but he never lost his elegance.

The beastly desire to have my presence pounded into her is sickling.

"Young Master. Permission to interrogate."

As he said this, the military officer placed his hand on the hilt of the sword at his waist.

It means let me punish the Rosé for not answering the question.

"No need to harm her unnecessarily. She has shown such loyalty to the Spierzeig family despite his capture, not to mention her age, that she will not give us any useful information about the forces attacking our outposts."

"That's right. And I didn't hear about the operation in the Raishleaf area. You were wrong, Quardenze."

We do not know if what she said is really true, as it is quite possible that she is lying about not knowing anything.

But neither of those things matter right now. For me, her body is the most beneficial.

"If it's of any use to you, you'll find another way. She is quite a beautiful girl." He turns a nasty smile to Rosé.

"What are you going to do, ......!"

I could see her stout demeanor crumble slightly.

She must at least know the direction of the answer by now.

"I think you can imagine what it would be like for a member of the Knight family. Securing a squire is a challenge for every knight family, so the treatment of a squire's woman, if captured, is not so different everywhere."

"You're going to let the military officers under your command rape me......! Fuck ......! Don't play with me, ......!

I was thinking about my handling of her, ignoring Rosé, who kept throwing words of resistance at me.

Frankly, if I gave Rosé the attention she deserves, she would continue to hate me.

No, she will hate the Quardenze family more than me. She grew up as a vassal of the Spierzeig family, and it would be extremely difficult to correct her values.

I've come from Eve's failures to want to get along and enjoy sex with each other if we can get along.

But that's only if we can get along. As for Rosé, I can't imagine a future where we can get along, so I may as well devour her as my sexual desires dictate.

If they hate you anyway, it won't make any difference if they hate you more.

"I will not yield to Quardenze! Don't you dare to touch me!"

Listening to her strong words, I was beginning to think that it would not be a bad idea to force her to give in and open her legs.

You have to beat them with the power of the main ancestor, make them realize the weakness of the follower, and then rape them when they beg for their lives. If her heart is broken, we may be able to get some information out of her.

I decided to run with the idea and looked at Rosé.

She was indeed a knight of the House of Spierzeig.

"You are a knight of the House of Spierzeig, and you have a wonderful fighting spirit. Let me reward you."

"What the hell is ......?"

Rosé's face contorted as she anticipated that it would not be a good one.

I gave an earful to the military officer standing next to me and then walked out of the tent.

The sun had already set, but instead the moon and stars were beginning to faintly

illuminate the land.

The battle area was moving further and further away from the city as we moved into the phase of reaping the remnants, and the area near the tent of the main camp was rather deserted, except for a few reserve units packed a short distance away.

"What are you going to do ......?"

Rosé, who followed me as I was dragged along by the military officer, said.

The military officer who had just overheard me scurried up to me and held out a sword. It was the weapon he had taken from Rose.

"There is no craftsmanship."

The military officer tells him that it is not a particularly unusual sword.

Even if poison were planted, it would not be able to destroy the body of the ancestor, but it would be troublesome if mana crystals filled with the ancestor's magical power were planted.

Considering the former prosperity of the Spierzeik family, it is not surprising that they have one or two mana crystals that flowed from the Mamshred Federation.

I'm sure that Rosé would have undergone a reasonable physical examination when she was brought before me, so now she is just an unarmed follower.

Thus, there is no one to stop them from fighting one-on-one.

When I checked the rosé sword, I threw it far away.

Perhaps it hit a stone on the ground during its fall, or perhaps it hit a stone on the ground, but the high sound peculiar to metal resonates well in the night sky.

"I will give you a chance to stand up for your lord. Take up the sword."

I said this to Rosé and then looked at the military officers surrounding her.

"You shall be untouched. ...... Oh, and if this girl prefers running away to avenging her lord, take her into custody immediately."

The military officer ignores Rosé's indignation at being made a fool of, and undoes the ropes binding her arms.

Rosé quickly stood up, leaned forward and sprinted, and picked up the sword I had thrown.

"Well, what's the matter? Why don't you call me?"

I borrowed the single-edged sword from the military officer's waist and pointed the tip of it at Rosé.

I didn't say a word to insist that a fight against a knight is not a duel, it's just a game,.......

Rosé, on the other hand, shows a polite bow once to the nobleman, and then points her sword at us.

"Vassal of the House of Spierzeig, Knight Shikinaon ......! I will avenge the enemies of the Lord!"

At the same time as the end of his speech, Rosé kicked the ground and accelerated toward us, sliding horizontally with a speed-skating form.

In addition to body enhancement magic, she must be using wind magic to lighten her body, and I sense that she has a large amount of magical power for her age.

"That's about right."

Looking at the way I carry myself, a squire from a commoner background would be no match for me. But that is not enough to harm me.

I spun around the single-edged sword I was holding and punched her in the stomach with the one without the blade.

"Kyah!"

I've aimed at an easily defensible spot, and the rosé defends well against my attacks.

However, it was not able to kill it to its full power, and the blow, topped with enhanced magic, blew Rose several meters away.

I magically create a ball of flame to follow up. A number of volleyball-sized fireballs floated around me, and a large number of fire sparks fluttered down, shaken by the wind.

One of the fireballs is released very close to the ground where the rosé is rolling.

As the fireball fell, it exploded in a pillar of fire high in the sky. The firelight looked like a huge ginkgo tree.

I fired fireball after fireball at her, toying with her as she rolled to escape the heat.

The heat from the columns of fire scorched the night sky, illuminating the surroundings.

"Oh my God, ......! Oh, you ......!"

I thought that the knowledge of the overwhelming difference in the amount of magical power would make her a little more reluctant, but her heart did not seem to be broken at all.

In fact, they seem to have become more angry when they saw this playful attack

magic. Even a knight can do this level of magic.

Again Rosé grabbed her sword and ran toward me and swung it.

"You think you can win against the nobility? You are a foolish girl."

I caught that flash with my bare hand. I could easily make this kind of move if I used the reinforcement magic well.

He invoked a magic to create a gust of wind and slammed it into Rose's entire body, and this time she did not fly through the air, but rolled away from him, rolling around on the ground.

"You still want to do it?"

I wonder if my words reached her. Blown away, Rose wobbles and stands up, using her sword as a cane.

"I know that a knight can't beat a nobleman. ......! But I, I can't lose. ......! Not against Quardenze! I can't lose, I can't lose ......!"

She kept getting up and slashing at me. And each time I played her off.

The sword flashes became slower and slower, and her approaching footsteps slowed. At the same time, the magical menace flying from her became turbulent with anger.

Unexpectedly, I flinched a little at the spirit of the approaching Rosé.

"Avenge the young master: ......! Get out of Spierzeig......! You invaders! ......!"

I kicked her out of the way, but she didn't give in and stood up, gripping her sword.

I was so unsteady that I felt as if I would collapse at any moment, but his eyes, full of hatred, held me in place.

"Give me back my grandfather, give me back my father, give me back my ...... uncle, give me back my brother, give me back my ......! Give me back my brother ......! Give me back my people of Shikinaon! Give me back my ......, my family!"

She said that my grandfather went around killing the knights of the Shikinaon

family, and, I see, that was her family, too.

Her anger may be rooted in the fact that her family was taken from her.

The next moment I was thinking about this, I felt a tremor of magic power on my

skin.

"Curse you, Quardenze!"

When a crisis is imminent, a person may exhibit what is called fire fool's power. In the same way, people with magical powers are said to release very strong magical power in extremely rare cases when their lives are in danger.

The pure vindictiveness and life-threatening crisis drew out of Rosé's body a magical power that exceeded its limits.

Rosé unleashed all the magic she had drawn upon, strengthening her body even more powerfully and activating her wind magic.

When I showed her my thrusting stance, she kicked the earth with her sword pointed at me. A cloud of dust rises behind me as a reaction.

The blow, which is far stronger than the previous enhancements, is ...... I don't know if I've ever seen anything like this.

It never reached me.

"ah ...... ah ............"

The magic power contained in the sword was transmitted as he grasped the tip and received it.

The sword, imbued with magic power, has the power to harm others just by touching it. If a commoner were to touch the tip of this sword as I did, he would get sores on his skin.

Of course it doesn't affect me in any way.

It is said that when the ancestor is in battle mode, the amount of magic power naturally released from the body increases, and this acts as a barrier. Therefore, they can repel even a few magical attacks.

The ultimate blow that exceeded Rosé's limits could not even break through that barrier. There might have been no room to reach if it had been attack magic, but even so, the impact this reality had on Rosé seemed to have been great.

"No......no...... way............"

This is not a trick that I was able to do because my magical power level surpasses that of the main ancestor.

Other nobles, such as Spiaseik Verret, whom we defeated today, would have prevented the same Rosé attack.

The difference between a nobleman and a knight, between a master and a

follower, is that far apart.

Rosé may have subconsciously forgotten that ...... or perhaps it would be better to say that she turned away.

"Well."

I went on and grabbed Rosé's sword.

Metal swords are easily shredded, just like an oil slick.

"Satisfied? Then it's my turn."

"Hic ......!"

As I grabbed Rosé by the neck to prevent her from escaping, I channeled my magic.

"Remember that the difference between us can never be overturned."

Since I only directed my killing intent at Verret during the duel, Rose was not directly affected by the wave of my killing intent. She probably only felt the aftermath.

Now he decided to release the wave toward the lozenge alone.

It would also be a good experiment to see if any knight could withstand a nobleman's order of magnitude of intimidation at close range.

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ！！！！"

The moment he uttered his murderous intent, Rosé screamed out in a high pitched voice that pierced my eardrums.

She seems to have been trapped in fear by my murderous intent and moves her body in a desperate attempt to escape from us.

The original injuries seemed to have been opened by this series of events, and fresh blood was dripping from the tattered armor.

But she didn't feel that pain, or perhaps she wanted to get away from me more than that, and she lashed out indifferently.

That's it.

Suppressing the threat, I spoke my hand from around Rosé's neck. Rosé had lost her strength and kneeled directly on the ground before I had time to support myself with my sword.

"Hi, hi ......! Hi ......!"

I see Rosé backing up with her butt on the ground, trying to get away from me.

A single tear spills from her eyes, which had felt strong-willed, and her chin quivers slightly, making it impossible for her to formulate words.

If you look closely at the area where she sat, you will see that the ground was wet and made a kind of puddle. She seemed to have become incontinent.

The sight of a stout woman so frightened that she is leaking urine is indescribably

erotic.

I could feel my meat stick getting harder and harder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 169 - Deliciously serving a female knight in the service of a sworn enemy (2/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As she continued to slide backward, Rose's eyes were tinged with fear for her ancestors.

The awe of the weak against the overwhelmingly strong draws its gaze and does not let go. She trembled at my every move.

I thrust my single-edged sword into the ground and point my palms at the military officers.

"Hold her down."

"Yes sir!"

Several military officers surrounded Rosé and feathered her arms and legs, instantly applying a demonic seal.

She is no longer able to release her magic power, and she can no longer even strengthen her body. 

She is now nothing more than a girl who is only slightly good at exercise.

"Nooooooooooooooooo ........."

Two armed men on the arms and two on the legs, and Rosé, bound in a starfish-like pose, screams in agony.

The inability to activate magic would have made it impossible to relieve the pain of the injury.

I have no taste for cutting up women and turning them into a bloody mess.

The only thing that makes me happy is the blood of a broken melon.

"Don't move."

"KU......!"

I performed a healing magic, ignoring the frightened Rose. A rainbow- colored band of light floated in the air, illuminating the surroundings fantastically.

By the time the light dissolved into the air as fine as powder grains, Rosé's wounds were gone and her white skin had returned.

"Phew...... phew......! If you're going to ......... be merciful,......! Kill ...... me at once!"

The healing magic also has a calming effect, and Rose seems to have recovered enough to speak from her state of panic.

However, her voice was not the dignified and confident one of a knight, but a weak one that was looking for my reaction.

"You sound very brave for such a fragile girl."

"You're on ......!"

If you're a girl, just be a girl and think about accepting a man."

I approach Rosé, implicitly teasing her about being scared of me.

"No ......, don't ...... make me the comfort of your men! Kill ......!

I was wondering about this earlier, but it seemed to me that there was no idea in her head that I was going to fuck Rosé.

I have a feeling that she thinks of himself as a very talkative young man who allows his military officers to gang-rape her.

But that may not be an option. An ordinary aristocrat would not think of having sex with such a woman whom he just met.

For Rosé, who grew up in a knight's house, the sexual delicacy of noble men must have been learned as common knowledge.

"How long do you intend to continue impersonating a knight? Miss."

I had no intention of gang raping Rosé, not even a tiny bit.

As is often the case in erotic manga, I like stories where a woman is raped because of her weakness.

However, such situations often lead to gang rape in the second half. To put it bluntly, it makes no sense.

I think the hero who has a weakness should continue to rape that heroine exclusively. Frankly, I don't feel any sincerity toward the heroine in the gang rape development.

How could she come up with the idea of sharing her heroine with another man after having gone to the trouble of acquiring her, I can only say that it is a thought that makes me doubt common sense.

Generally speaking, no other man would want to insert his cock into a vagina that has just been poured with semen.

That's why I'm not going to gang rape with dishonesty. I'm going to rape with sincerity.

"There, I'll strip you of your knighthood."

The armor worn by the rosé was a standard specification armor divided into several parts.

He slips the knife around the boundary between the torso and shoulder parts, puts magic power into the tip, and raises it as high as he can.

The sound of metal breaking off with a clang echoed, and a piece of the part protecting the shoulder fell to the ground with a clang.

"Damn ......!"

The parts were removed, revealing the fabric of the clothes worn underneath.

I concentrate on destroying the shoulder parts, not on the parts of the armor that protect the shoulder to the elbow and the elbow to the wrist.

Rosé moved to escape somehow, but she could do nothing when she was restrained by the military officers, who were large adults.

With the connection to the shoulder broken, the chest plate could easily be pulled off.

"Nice figure, Rosé. I couldn't see it hidden by the armor, but you have a nice womanly body. ......"

He inspects her body, saying lines like a middle-aged man.

There was a beauty there that had been squeezed into a hard armor.

At a quick glance, Rosé has a model figure.

She has long, slender arms and legs, and is tall, probably over 170 cm.

Her fingers are thin and delicate, and she would look great playing the piano.

I think she would be better holding a cock than a sword.

Her breasts were reasonably large in proportion to her slender limbs and torso, and their imbalance was also attractive.

Her armor has been destroyed at the shoulders and chest, and her lower body parts are nearly broken in places.

After all, when you force someone to do something, you want to play with them clothed. It is good to feel like you are forcing yourself on someone.

"Oh, ......! Whoa, this is quite ......"

He sneaks his hand through a gap in the thigh armor and invades Rose's inner thigh.

When I pressed my hand hard against the plump, fresh skin, I could see the flexible elasticity inside it. I felt both the softness of a woman and the muscles trained as a warrior at the same time.

I crawl to lick that fine flesh with the palm of my hand.

"C'mon ......, stop ......!"

Unfortunately, the armor is in the way and prevents them from reaching the buttocks.

I put my other hand on Rosé's chest.

I pull up her stiff clothes a little and put my hand in the gap between the fabric.

Hmm?

She did not seem to be wearing any particular underwear under her clothes, and what was there was the soft skin of a young girl.

Only the tips of her fingers were still aware of her nakedness, but the presence of a nubile, toned waist was palpable.

It must be a great feeling to grab this nipple with both hands and swing your hips as hard as you can.

"Oooh, ......!"

My fingers eventually reach her chest.

I cupped her breast in the palm of my hand and pictured its shape in my brain. Her taut, firm breasts were full of energy, something typical of a young girl.

I like the meltingly soft tits of a mature woman, but I also liked these elastic tits filled to the brim with energy.

No matter how big or small, there is no nobility in tits.

"......, ............, and ......"

When I mobilized the hand that had been touching my thigh and began to play with her breasts with both hands, Rosé's face contorted in silence. That aroused me even more.

"What's the matter, is this the first time you've had your breasts touched?"

"...... answers, stuff ......!"

Looking at her face, which was slightly reddened with shame, it was easy to see that she had no experience with men.

If she didn't work more aggressively to catch dicks, the Shikinaon family would probably die out, but she's a very easygoing girl.

Well, maybe I was lucky because that would have made me her first man.

I tore off Rosé's jacket with a knife, completely exposing her breasts.

"Aah!"

Rose's breasts, which popped out with a plop, maintained their shape in a healthy way.

Despite the fact that she is half lying down, her tits are sticking out as if they were protruding. I wonder if this is what rocket tits are called.

At the tip of the nipple, which protrudes as if asking to be sucked, is a light brown nipple.

I swallowed hard.

I looked around and saw that before I knew it, partitions had been set up to surround me.

They are lined with cloth camp curtains, slightly taller than a man's height, to

hide them from the soldiers.

In a space that would have been divided into a pentagon if seen from above, there are me, Rose, and the military officers who hold her down.

I glanced at the military officers and they nodded silently and looked away.

Feel free to enjoy ...... I interpret it that way.

"...... is muuuuch."

"Hi-?"

I sucked on her nipples to my heart's content and ran my tongue over them, tickling her areolas and teasing her nipples.

The smell of sweat clings to the cleavage of her breasts, and she can taste a faint saltiness in the nipples she sucks on.

Her thick body odor tickled my nostrils, as if she had not had a chance to wash her body properly since her departure for battle.

"No, don't ......! What are you ...... doing?

"Mm?"

I turned my eyes only to Rosé as I sucked her nipples with a chummy sound.

She seemed to be astonished at my behavior itself rather than at being raped.

I lick the entire breast and then answer the question.

"Man and woman, there's only one thing to do, right? This is it."

I sat up and moved my hips. There was an erection under my trousers, and there was the lower half of my body, with the cloth puckered up.

When Rosé saw the bulge, she looked stunned for a moment, but her face soon regained a serious look.

"Oh ...... to get excited about a woman you just met! Nobility, but ......! I can't believe ...... what a ......!"

Because aristocrats have a low libido, even if they fall in love at first sight, they do not get an instant erection and immediate sex.

Rosé seemed genuinely surprised by the presence of the aristocrat, who instantly got an erection upon meeting him.

There is no need for detailed logic in the activities of a man and a woman. Let's continue."

As we brought our bodies closer together again, Rosé seemed to immediately

remember the situation she was in.

Exhaling in a huff, she twisted around to escape the military officer's restraints.

"Kuku......Kuku......! Let go of me......! Don't ............ let me be raped by Quardenze, don't ...... let me be humiliated! I don't want to be ......humiliated, I don't want to be ...... killed!

"Are you going to give me orders?"

When I mutter this quietly, Rose shows a strange expression that seems to be a combination of irritation and trepidation.

I am glad to see that you remember the fear of nobility.

I kept my eyes fixed on her eyes and again put one hand on her breast and nipped at her body.

"Chu."

"Ugh!"

He kisses Rosé's neck and begins to caress her with his tongue without releasing her lips.

I tickled the collarbone with my tongue, then moved along the

neck to the cheek.

"Ohhhh ......, stop ......, ......!"

She shook her head and resisted as I licked around her ears. Her hair moved softly, and a body odor that stimulated my meat hooks wafted from her hair.

While it is nice to have intercourse in a clean bed after a bath, sometimes it is not so bad to have such wild intercourse.

I followed my swelling sexual desire and inhaled her scent as much as I wanted.

"Uhhhh ......! Hana-see...... yeah......"

To support my copulation, the military officers seem to be holding Rosé down with considerable force. The neck and torso may move a little, but the limbs re not moving at all.

However, as expected, I decided not to kiss her on the lips because she might bite me if I did.

Taking out the knife again, I slashed through the belt at her waist.

When I tried to pull off the metal lower body armor, Rosé resisted by flapping her legs, saying, "No, no." However, since her legs were secured by the armor, the only thing that moved was her thigh.

"Be quiet. Resistance is futile."

He tore off his armor with force and slammed it to the ground as hard as he could as it turned to scrap iron.

She seemed to be wearing shorts-like trousers under her armor. The white skin on her long legs and the slight rise of her muscles were truly disgusting.

The faint smell of ammonia must be from the urine she had just leaked.

"I hate ......, I hate ......, I hate ......, I hate ......"

Even if she wanted to close her legs, they could not do so because both legs were held by separate military officers.

"Quardenze is ......! No ......, don't! Help me, Father! Brother! No! No!"

"Do you miss your family? Don't worry, you'll have more soon if you just have

a little patience. You did it, Rosé."

He cuts open a pair of shorts with a knife, and then pulls down even more of the colorless underwear underneath.

She seemed to have leaked quite a bit of urine, and her underwear was soaking wet. Although I do not have a particular urine fetish, my penis reacted reflexively.

When we finally looked at the exposed pubic area, we found a dense and dense forest.

The gap between her beautiful appearance and her unkempt, sloppy pubic hair is interesting.

"Phew ......! Phew ......! Huh ............!"

I put my finger inside the sparse pubic hair. Moist and wet with urine, it reminded me of a tropical rainforest.

The fact that she had a lot of pubic hair indicated that she had no fiancée. My fingers continued to explore unexplored territory.

"Touch me, hey ......, don't ......"

When I reached the labia and checked them with my fingertips, I gently placed my fingers on the clitoris.

"Ah, ah! What are you doing?"

I gently touched her pubic area with my finger and enjoyed her reaction.

She panicked at the unknown sensation, and when she thought her expression changed to one of pain, she let out a slightly glazed breath.

I felt an inexpressible love for that gesture and decided to prioritize my own pleasure over caressing.

I haven't pulled out once yet today, and I'm feeling a strong desire to get one out of me as soon as possible. It is not a punishment if I have self-centered sex once in a while.

I unbuckled my belt with a clinking sound to show her.

Anticipating that the show was finally coming, Rosé went on a rampage here and there, but it only served to excite me.

Having a frightened woman hear the sound of the belt being unbuckled was like announcing that I was going to rape her, and it was somehow uplifting.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 170 - Deliciously serving a female knight in the service of a sworn enemy (3/3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pole was erected perpendicular to the night sky as it popped out of his pants.

The angle is such that if I ejaculate at this point, the semen would splash against my chin.

I instructed the military officer to change me into a position that would make it easier for him to fuck her in the doggy position.

"Be quiet!"

"Obey the young master's orders!"

"Don't struggle, little girl."

"Oh, ......! No! Stop, stop ......! Aah!

Rosé is made to look like a cat stretching its paws and raising its buttocks in a pose similar to the customary stretching pose of a cat stretching its paws and raising its buttocks.

The only thing different from a cat would be the way the hind legs open. The two military officers have secured her right and left feet respectively, so the local area is opened to the left and right, and the place where it should be inserted can be seen clearly.

"I'm gonna put it in."

Without waiting for a reply, I put one hand on Rose's ass and with the other hand I grasped the meat stick and guided it to her vaginal opening.

She wiggled her hips desperately trying to escape my cock, but unfortunately it was nothing more than a man-pleasing move.

I gripped Rosé's cinched waist with both hands and I inserted my meat stick into her vagina.

"Gghh......aaaahhh......! "

"Aah! Aah! Aah!"

The resistance of her barely wet vagina was strong. It's a feeling like the glans is stuck or being pinched.

I held Rosé's hips as she tried to escape and forced my meat hook deep into her. I felt much more resistance than I would have if I had charged into an enemy troop.

"...... that's tight ...... phew, I'm gonna get crushed."

I took a breath when my dick was in all the way to the base.

Just imagining myself fucking a girl doggy style as she is seized by the military officers ...... brings my excitement to a climax and I feel like I'm going to ejaculate just like that.

Her vagina is very tight in the front while very soft in the back. Especially around the vulva, it tightens so well that I thought she was trying to tear my penis off.

"Aaaaahhhh ...... kooo ......! Get out of ...... the ......! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Uhh......"

I stopped moving once and decided to taste her vagina as I caressed Rosé.

If we move to the piston movement at this point, not only Rosé but also I will not be able to feel good because she is not very wet at the moment.

"Hmm, is this your first time accepting a man?"

I wasn't at all sure if she was a virgin or not because of too much resistance during insertion.

The first time you see Rose's first time, you can tell that this is her first experience.

I stroked her buttocks, as if to see how far the meat stick inside her had reached.

"Oh, yeah, it's your first time. Good, good, because I'm going to pour a lot of my seed

into you."

"No, don't ......, no ......, no ......!"

She moved her face, which was pressed against the ground, and looked at me.

Her eyes were staring at me, but they seemed to be moist somehow.

I wet my fingers with saliva and stretch them to her pubic area and start stimulating it.

While he fiddled with the curling bean, he rubbed the taut buttocks with his other hand so that the stimulation would be transmitted to the anus.

"Aah! No, stop! You can't touch me there. ...... Oh, no, stop. ......!"

"Is this what you want?"

The movement of peeling the clitoris back and forth seems to be Rosé's favorite. I check her reaction by speeding up and slowing down the skin play.

Every time Rose screamed under my caress, I felt a sweet stimulation in my brain. Its probably the meat stick would be slurping up the pussy juice in her vagina.

As I continued to caress her pubic area for a while, I think I began to understand her weak spot.

She responds better to indirect clitoral stimulation by moving her foreskin than to direct finger teasing.

As I continued to caress her, I could see that her love juices were slowly increasing, albeit slightly.

"You know, Rose, I'm inside you right now."

"Ggggghhhh ......!"

The vagina of Rosé shrinks, as if in response to the words of this.

The feeling of her mucous membranes clinging tightly and seamlessly to mine made me sigh with pleasure.

I keep talking to distract myself from my desire to ejaculate.

"How does it feel to be penetrated by a Quardenze?"

Rosé looks away and doesn't answer that question.

I increased the stimulation to her secret area as punishment, and she stared at me, her breath ragged.

"I'm going to cum deep in Rosé, and I'm going to cum a lot."

"What the ......!"

"I'm going to cum deep inside of Rosé. I think I might impregnate her in one shot. ......"

The sticky, sticky seed is planted in the back of a beautiful woman's vagina. It is the moment when a man feels the most happiness.

He repeated the words to tease her fright.

"Let me tell you, my seed is very sticky. Once I put it deep inside you, it will stick to you and you won't be able to scrape it out. My seed will stay inside you forever."

"Here it is," he said, pressing his hips hard to make her aware of his penis.

"Oh ......!　Oh ......!　No......!"

Each time I whispered about the seed, Rose's breathing became more ragged.

The contractions of her vagina quickened their rhythm, and the mucous membranes inside felt gradually softened and heated.

The caresses and verbal assaults on her pubic nucleus were transforming her body into a female.

"Your belly will be Quardenze's ...... no, mine. Aren't you happy about that?"

"U...... not happy, not at all......!　I will not bear ...... Quardenze's ...... child, etc.......!　Who, my ......!　I will not be impregnated!"

Why is it that when she rejects me, I feel compelled to force myself on her? Her words of resistance caress my ears sensitively.

She said so with her mouth, too, but her body was responding honestly. The sound of the water was coming from the junction.

I moved my hips slowly back and forth, and the resistance was becoming almost non-existent due to the overflowing love juices.

I start the piston movement at a speed that does not neglect the resources I turn to caress her.

As the glans recedes to near the entrance of the vagina, Rose's body adsorbs me as if to say, "Don't go out. I responded honestly to her unspoken voice and pushed the glans back into the vaginal opening.

"Hmph, hmph, hmph. ......!"

Rose endures the relentless invasion and withdrawal of my penis as hard as she can.

　

I put my hand on her back and whisper softly.

"Do you want a baby?"

"What do you ...... say?"

"I'm getting so soft inside. I'll tell you, this means that your body wants to procreate,"

He assures her confidently.

"Phew, phew,...... as if I would do such a thing,...... ah!　Pff ......!"

"It's true. It's just as soft as the women I usually hold. So I know that your body is begging for my seed."

The reason for this is because I was speaking in a very definitive tone of voice.

She looked so cute as she mumbled to herself, "No, no, no."

"If you want seed, why don't you just tell me honestly?　I'm nice to beautiful women, I'll pour as much as I want."

"Hah......huff......huff......!　Hu......a......!　Ugh!"

She kept her face down and moved her body with the last of her strength to escape from the military officers' restraints.

Of course, she cannot escape from the military officers with such weak strength.

"Help me,...... father,...... brother,......!　Help me,...... I hate ...... him,.........! ..."

I was aroused by the sound of her voice, which was so faint that it was almost drowned out by the sound of the pistons, and I accelerated the movement of my hips even further.

I let the penis do the stimulating, and I clamped down on her well-defined neck.

It's instinct that makes woman want my seed. You want a strong seed, don't you?　Do you want the seed of the master?　How about it, aren't you really happy?"

"No," Rose exclaimed.

I ignore her words and swing my hips as hard as I can. The rod, now hardened to the limit, finally ascends to the final stage of ejaculation.

"Your body is telling you that it wants the strong seed of Quardenze more than the weak seed of Spierzeig!　You want a strong child with the blood of Quardenze Wilk!"

She was forced to rub her face against the ground as she swung her hips, not caring about the position of her opponent.

Unable to speak satisfactorily, Rose denied my words by moving her neck and shoulders slightly to the left and right.

The only regret was that I could not see her expression due to her position. But even so, the sight of my daughter in tattered armor being fucked in the doggy style comfortably satisfied the animal lust raging inside me.

"Hah, hah, ...... I'm gonna get it out of you!　I'm going to plant a strong man's seed inside you, Rose!"

"Muggghh!"

Rose, her face rubbing against the ground, let out a muffled scream. To silence her scream, I thrust my rod deep into her as hard as I could.

I am aware of the strength in my hands gripping her waist. I commanded my men to seize the woman and rape her with force, which can truly be called rape.

There is a goodness in putting a seed in a woman who does not want it, that is not found in sex in which both parties make love to each other.

The moment I tasted this delicious taste in my brain, which I had not tasted in a long time, the base of my rod contracted hot and tight.

"Ggh!　I'm going to let it out!　Take it!"

"Mmmmmm!"

Spurt...Spurt...Spurt...

The most squeezed juice of the day was shooting out into the back of her mouth.

I don't know where in the world she had the strength to do that, but she was resisting my seeding with a force that seemed to dislocate her, but I was desperate to seed her too.

My penis spurted out seed with a "spurt...spurt...spurt..." and I gave a violent marking to a girl, who I was holding for the first time.

Yes, this is marking. He sprays the proof that he has won this girl by force from the tip of his dick into her.

"Oh ...... oh ............ squeeze ......... ...Good one, Rose............ ah...... phew...... ......"

The vaginal walls surrounding the penis keep contracting and contracting to help this one ejaculate. It was nothing more than the fact that her body was seeking semen.

The most important thing to remember is that the vaginal walls surrounding your penis are contracting to help you ejaculate, and that's just the fact that your body needs to cum.

"Fuu...... fuu......!　Fuck, oh ......!　......Yeah ......!"

With her face covered in mud, Rose is unable to speak.

She must have understood that she herself was in the very midst of being seeded as she was subjected to the slight back and forth motion for ejaculation.

I could see her gaze, which had been staring strongly at me, gradually losing its power and becoming tinged with despair.

"Haa......, that was good."

The ejaculation was complete, and after a few moments of reverie, he pulled out his deflated meat pole.

The force of the withdrawal caused some of the semen to spill out in a slurp. I wonder if it was the military officer who let out an exclamatory thought, "Oh ......."

The white streak that hung down my secret and disappeared along my thighs into my armor eloquently indicated that my copulation was over.

"............Ah............Ugh... ............... this, this ............ ..................Uh...... ah... ..................... ugh ...... ......"

She is held down so I can't see the semen dripping out of her vagina.

I, being the witty one that I am, ordered the military officers to return Rose's position to the supine, starfish pose.

"Aaaaahhhh ............ ah......!　Oh, no. ......"

When Rose saw the white fluid overflowing from her own crotch, she was neither angry nor crying, but simply seemed at a loss.

Either way, it is still impossible to wipe it off or scrape it off, and all you can do is just look at it.

"I don't like it ............ when you give me so much ............, I don't like it .................., please .................., let me wipe ......, let me wipe ......."

The sight of her unwillingness to bear a child was also attractive enough to revive my deflated penis again.

Rosé looked at me with her lightless eyes, noticing that I had begun to raise the angle of my dick again.

It might be hard for her, but the night had only just begun.
